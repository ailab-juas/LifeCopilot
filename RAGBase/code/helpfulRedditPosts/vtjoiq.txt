YSK that US banks are required to allow you to opt out of overdraft fees. If you do, charges that would send you negative are declined instead.

**Why YSK:** The $35 overdraft fee can be absolutely brutal, especially for people in college or who just got their first job. Keeping a close watch on your bank balances is a skill most people seem to learn the hard way.

Overdraft fees are an income source for banks. Almost all of them will let you overdraw your account and fine you by default. This is deceptively called "overdraft protection". 

If you opt out, debit card charges that would send you into the red are declined instead. Anyone living paycheck to paycheck should seriously consider opting out. 

The flip side is that important bills may not go through. Missing a mortgage payment is a lot more expensive than an overdraft fee. It may be worth setting up a different account for important bills.

Edit: Some good points from the comments:

* Credit unions non-profit, and beholden to their clients rather than stock holders. They are much better than banks. 

* This ONLY applies to charges made using a debit card. Checks, monthly payments for stuff like Netflix and anything hooked directly into your bank account will still get charged. 

* Bank tellers can apparently claim to opt you out but not follow through. I recommend double checking. Some banks allow you to opt out online which may be more reliable.

* Several people have said that they got overdraft fees overturned by calmly asking the bank teller.
