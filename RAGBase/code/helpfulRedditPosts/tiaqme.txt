LPT: Always keep your dog on a leash while walking outside!

content:
No matter how well-behaved you think your dog is, you simply have no idea how other dogs are going to react to an off-leash dog coming up to them. My dog is extremely friendly to other pups but outside of the dog park he becomes aggressive (he will pull on the leash to get close to the other dog - I used a poor choice of words here) while on a leash. Not only for the safety of you and your dog but also the safety of others, please keep your dog on a leash!

Edit: I suppose I should clarify! I live in a populated city, so everyday when I walk my dog I see multiple people. I thought it went without saying but, obviously if you are in an area where there is no one around or your chances of running into another person is low, then by all means let your dog run around off lead! My point of this post was to point out that so many dogs and their owners get injured due to another dog being off-leash.

Edit 2: PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR LOCAL LEASH LAWS!!

Edit 3: I used a poor choice of words to describe my own dog’s actions while on a leash. He loves other dogs and wants to interact and play with them just as he’s used to in the dog park so I make him sit while other dogs pass. I do this because his actions could make a dog I DO NOT KNOW act/react in a way that could become problematic.

Edit 4: Y’all, I just want your dogs to be safe. If they need more exercise then take them to a dog park to run around. Be mindful of others is all I’m trying to say; you may know your dog but you don’t know a stranger’s dog. I JUST WANT ALL THE DOGS TO BE SAFE!!! Never thought this post would be so controversial.
