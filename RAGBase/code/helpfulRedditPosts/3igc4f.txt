LPT: when one smoke detector starts chirping change the batteries in all of them, that way you only play the "find the chirping before I go insane" game once.

content:
There's nothing you can do to stop the inevitable 3 AM smoke detector chirp (because batteries never get low on them at 4 PM, that wouldn't be disruptive enough), but this will keep you from doing the crazy dance from room to room trying to find exactly which one it is.  We have smoke detectors relatively close together in my place so sometimes it's hard to figure out which one is chirping; plus, by changing the batteries in all of them you minimize the number of nights you are awoken by a low battery chirp!

Edit: wow! I didn't realize people felt so strongly about smoke detectors. I just wanted to make it clear that I'm not only advocating changing the batteries when a single alarm chirps. But if you're like me, even if you schedule a date every year you plan on changing all the batteries, you will STILL forget somehow. This is just a nice solution in that, instead of waiting for each battery to die in each individual detector, you only have the battery die in one detector before each one in your house gets a fresh battery.

Edit 2:  I love how many people have stories about the dreaded chirping.
