LPT: If you have a family member who is overweight and requires frequent medical attention...don’t put their bedroom upstairs

content:
As a firefighter I’ve seen this too many times. A family member who has serious medical problems, is overweight, and immobile should not have a bedroom upstairs. It takes a lot of manpower and time to remove an unconscious person from an upstairs bedroom. These are precious seconds lost that could have potentially cost your loved one their life
