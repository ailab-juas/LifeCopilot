title:
LPT: If someone slights/insults you publicly during a meeting, pretend like you didn't hear them the first time and politely ask them to repeat themself. They'll either double-down &amp; repeat the insult again, making them look rude &amp; unprofessional. Or they'll realize their mistake &amp; apologize to you.
