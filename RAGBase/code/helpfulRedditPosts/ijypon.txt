LPT: If you have a guest room, stay in there to see how your guests feel

content:
Having my master bedroom painted, so I'm sleeping in the guest room. Unbeknownst to me, my guests have been sleeping on pillows with pillow cases that feel like fucking sandpaper on your face. I'm so embarrassed I've been having guests sleep on these pillows for years. New pillows and new pillow cases coming up!
