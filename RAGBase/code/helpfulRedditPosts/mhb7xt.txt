YSK: Moss is the new grass

content:
In many parts of the world, moss can easily be grown as an alternative to grass. It requires no mowing and less watering, so it takes less effort overall and is more environmental.

Why YSK: Moss is often a great alternative to grass, as it is more environmental and doesn't need mowing

Edit: I do not know personally what type of moss grows best in your area or how much care it would need in your area. I suggest calling your local park/forest reserve/botanical gardens/plant store.

Edit 2: If you're looking for cool lawn ideas, I also knew a guy who replaced his whole lawn with creeping thyme, and did yoga on it everyday so he could enjoy the smell.
