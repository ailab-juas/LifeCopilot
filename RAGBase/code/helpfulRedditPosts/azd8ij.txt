title:
YSK There's a website that lets you check if a movie/tv show has sensitive/upsetting topics (dogs dying, cancer, car crashes, etc.) before you watch.

content:
I'm not an overly sensitive person with violence, sex, whatever. But I wish I checked out [DoesTheDogDie.com](https://www.doesthedogdie.com) before I watched Game of Thrones (*no spoilers from me beyond S1E2*). Kill all the people you want on screen, enh. Kill/hurt one dog, I'm an inconsolable mess. Stopped watching the show. 

Anyway, it's a good resource if you have sensitive subjects you're concerned about seeing before watching a movie or show. 

Edit: formatting. 

Edit 2: a few people are popping in here with the boring troll comments like "snowflake" and the like. This site is not about censorship, put down the V mask and relax. See, there are people out there who have had some actual hardships in life that maybe they'd prefer not to relive in a movie or TV show. I'm glad that *you're* made of pure granite and studied the blade or whatever, but there is nothing wrong with wanting to avoid a film or show that could bring up terrible things from one's own past. Don't gatekeep people's experiences because you think you're a paragon of self-control and manliness. 

Edit 3: shoutout to the troll brigade hassling people about their experiences (and my being blind, wooooo!) down in the bottom. Glad you could make it &lt;3
