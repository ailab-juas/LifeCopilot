LPT: use 'tk' when you're writing but you know you need to edit later

content:
In written English, practically zero words have the letters tk next to each other.

This means is you're in the flow and need to double check a fact, or change the name of a character or something, just put tk in and carry on writing.

Then later, you can search the document for 'tk' and find all the things that you didn't want to stop and think about at the time.
