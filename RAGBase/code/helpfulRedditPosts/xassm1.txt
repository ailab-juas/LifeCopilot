LPT - How you format your resume MATTERS

content:
Hi there! I am a former tech recruiter and I have sifted through thousands of resumes throughout my career. A couple of tips:

&amp;#x200B;

1)Have an easy-to-read resume file name. First name + last name+ “resume”. Example John\_Smith\_Resume.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Use bullet points!!! Long paragraphs are a no-no and we do not want to read them. We look for keywords.

&amp;#x200B;

3) each bullet point should start with a verb. What did you do, and what was the result? Ex: “Created a customer analytics dashboard that helped team increase revenue by 10%”.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to dm or comment if you have questions!
