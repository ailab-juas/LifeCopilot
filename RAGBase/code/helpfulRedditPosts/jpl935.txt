LPT: Cheap clothes tailored to you look more elegant and expensive than expensive clothes right off the rack.

content:
We often think expensive means quality and fit. But the right silhouette and clothing tailored to your measurements will make you look so much more elegant and put together than a 300 dollar dress made to avg sample proportions. Always factor cost of tailoring into the final cost of an item and then purchase.
