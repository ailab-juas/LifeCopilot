LPT: if a company gives you a verbal, "unofficial" job offer, continue searching for other jobs, because they could be continuing to search for other candidates.

content:
Recently got an unofficial offer from a large ad agency - unofficial because it was a new account and they were processing paperwork to create the new position - and, when I followed up to check on the status of things, was told that they had found someone else whom they had worked with before and who wanted less money. No discussion with me to see if I would take less money. They asked that I keep them posted with any other offers I might receive, but made no mention that they were continuing to interview other candidates. Maybe it was naive of me to assume they'd keep their word, but it was a shitty thing to do and I wouldn't want to work for a group of people who operate like that.
