LPT: If you get panic attacks

content:
I have been getting panic attacks for a long time now and let me already agree with you, they're the absolute worst.  I have tried many things to help myself through them(because once they start, it isn't a matter of prevention, it's a matter of minimizing) but nothing has ever helped.  Enter: Fitness trackers.  I recently bought myself  a Fitbit charge HR without thinking it was going to be of aid to this part of my life.  When i received my first attack, i found out how much it helped to subdue my panic.  One of the big problems I face is when I am going through an attack I will nonstop try to take my pulse via neck and each time I do that I count that my heart rate is at a crazy high level which ends up increasing the intensity of the panic.  I try my hardest not to do this but, in the end, I always seem to do it.  The fitness tracker has a constant hear rate monitor in ti that i can check with the push of a button.  Seeing my heart rate, one that isnt as high as a person in my state would think it would be, has proved to be a mechanism to calm myself down.  Even better, If i use other techniques to calm myself I can actually see my HR go down as i do them.  This has been a big game changer for me, and I only hope that people reading this can benefit in the same way.

EDIT: Hey all! Never thought this would get as many up votes as it has and thank you all for all the great comments and suggestions.  I think this goes to show that if you ever find tips and strategies that help your way through panic attacks then people will really appreciate it if you share.  It also shows that this happens to quite a bit of people and it's nice to be able to talk about it with other redditors that have been going through things similar to what you have.  Thanks again.
