YSK: Talking to yourself is actually considered healthy.

As said by Paloma Mari-Beffa [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/is-talking-to-yourself-a-sign-of-mental-illness-an-expert-delivers-her-verdict-77058), "talking out loud, when the mind is not wandering, could actually be a sign of high cognitive functioning. Rather than being mentally ill, it can make you intellectually more competent.Â "


So yes. You're not insane... Even if you talk to yourself aloud.

**Edit**: As many people have pointed out, it is very important that you have healthy conversations with yourself. Also take care to not become too self absorbed and thus disconnected from people.

**Edit 2:** Please don't confuse schizophrenic self talk with healthy self talk. If you're not sure which category your self talk belongs to, please talk to a person with knowledge on this subject.

In my case, I now compliment myself on my qualities and guide myself to work on my negative traits. Earlier I used to berate and dimnish myself which led to a lack of self esteem. Now with this technique of evaluating myself, I feel much better now, I'm slowly building my self-esteem and I feel much more confident.
