title:
LPT: You should check everywhere on your body every once in awhile to see if you have a new mole or a body mark bigger than an eraser at the top of a pencil.

content:
If you see you have a new mole or body mark on your body that wasn’t there before, go to the doctor because it could be skin cancer.

EDIT: The ABCDE rule which signals for signs of melanoma (skin cancer) 
A= ASYMMETRY: if 2 half’s look different it could be skin cancer 
B= BORDER: a round smooth border of the mole or skin mark is a good sign, but if it has a unnatural border, get it checked out. 
C= COLOR: one color is good, but multiple colors could be a sign of skin cancer. 
D= DIAMETER: if once again, it’s bigger than a pencil erasers, it could be a sign of skin cancer. 
E= EVOLUTION: if it has change in size, color, or shape, get it checked out.
