LPT: Most of being attractive is just the way you take care of yourself. Few people are so truly ugly that they couldn’t be attractive with the right grooming, style, and/or weight control.

Being attractive is 30% what you’re born with and 70% what you do with it. No one is so attractive that poor hygiene, grooming, style, and/or weight gain couldn’t make them ugly. On the flip side, most people could be at least decently attractive with the right habits and style.

Take Stranger Things’ Joe Keery as an [example](https://www.allure.com/story/joe-keery-bowl-cut-hairstyle). Change the hair, the style, and the grooming and he goes from national heartthrob to being just some dude.

Sure, we can’t all be Karen Gillan and Zac Efron, but most of us could at least look nice with the right effort.
