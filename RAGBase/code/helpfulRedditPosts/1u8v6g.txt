LPT: for anyone who made a "read more" New Years resolution.

content:
This is an *extremely* simple trick to help you "read more". I started about 4 years ago and went from reading 1 book every month or so, to 2-3 per month consistently. Meaning after 4 years I've read 96-144 books as opposed to the (under) 40 I would have read without using this trick. Many people already do this subconsciously, but I never knew and I'm continually surprised by how often people tell me they've never thought to do this. 


**1.** Decide how many books you'd like to read per month, for this example let's say 2. Divide the total number of pages in the book by 15 days of the month (2 books/ month). *That is how many pages you must read per day.* So, if your book has 300 pages you have to read 20 pages everyday. 


It's no big deal if you miss a day or don't hit the goal because at least you now know to block out some extra time in the morning or evening or lunch break to catch up. If you miss your goal for a couple days, you can focus on catching up on the weekend. If you're on a kindle this is even easier, you know you have to finish 50% of the book in a week or 7% per day. For larger books, pair them with a smaller book that way you can spend 3 weeks on the big one and 1 week on the small one.


Super simple in theory, more difficult in practice but boy does it help. It's like having a trip mapped out. If you're driving from New York to California it's extremely helpful if not necessary to know where you're stopping ahead of time and therefore how far you *need/ want* to drive each day. When you don't measure the distance first, trips seem a lot more daunting and you're prone to take much longer to get thereâ€¦ or get lost all together. I like to read at night, and when I get tired it's so much easier armed with the knowledge that "I just need to finish 5 more pages" rather than giving up. 



**2.** Make a list of books you'd like to read (on your phone or something) and update it every time you hear about an interesting book. That way you don't lose any time in the deliberation process. Make sure you already have your next book chosen, purchased, checked out, etc. before you finish your current book. Gives you an extra day or 2 of reading per month. 


Like I said, super simple, but it has proven to be a game changer for me. 


**TL;DR-** 1. Check how many pages are in the book, divide by how many days you'd like to spend reading. 2. Make a list, don't spend time deliberating on what to read.


EDIT: Wow, what a great response! There's a lot of other great tips here that I'm going to add below in a minute. 
First I wanted to clarify that I LOVE reading. LOVE IT. I think it's one of the most important as well as enjoyable things a person can do for themself. I use this technique, not to make reading a chore, but just to make myself consciously aware of progress. That's all. It does nothing to take away enjoyment. I want to read and enjoy as many books as humanly possible, but as numerous people have said "time" is one of the largest factors here. This trick only allows me to be practical about progress. I do usually just read as much as I want in a given time, but I'm also now aware of progress. 
One could draw a parallel to traveling. If you want to travel to as many countries in the world as possible, it would be helpful to have a game plan ahead of time. That game plan in no way diminishes the enjoyment of visiting a new place, and you can elect to spend more or less time there as you so choose, while at the same time staying aware that there are numerous other countries you wish to visit as well. 


However, as a couple people mentioned some books are more of a process to read than others. If I'm reading Dan Brown or Michael Crichton, the pages turn themselves. However, there's other literature equally or arguably more important that is slower and slightly more bland to digest. For example, I'm a big history buff. Sometimes history can be thrilling but sometimes you're desperate for the knowledge and it's slow moving. Still enjoyable, but I do not want to spend 2 months on 1 history book. There are thousands of great books I want to read! Know what I mean? Many career/ business/ self help books/ etc can be extremely beneficial to read but are often a little dry. When reading for academia or research purposes, it's often necessary to move slower to fully comprehend the material and take notes. And also, I'm sure it's not for everybody. 


To the point that "read more" is a poor New Years resolution, I totally agree. I was definitely making sarcastic "air quotes". It's a horrible and unattainable goal you hear too often, hence why I gave the tip. It makes your goal measurable as all good goals should be. 


Hell yea there's a TL;DR, this aint a good book it's a way long LPT. C'mon now.

**3.** /u/Cellophane_Girl "Goodreads.com is excellent for keeping track of books you've read and want to read. You can also rate and review them and see reviews of others."

**4.** /u/LeopoldTheLlama "I had greatest success with reading more when I decided to give up internet/tv/electronic devices (kindle excepted) after 10pm."
