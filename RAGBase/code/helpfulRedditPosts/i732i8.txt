YSK that even if a spam email says it knows your password, it probably still doesn't have intimate pics of you. Don't send them money.

This has happened to myself and a few people I know. I also saw it on the other side of Reddit and thought it is not well-known enough (given the people I know panicking).

They find the most vulnerable thing (eg a leaked old password) which freaks you out and makes you think they have access to much more than they actually do.

Edit: Since this is getting a lot of traction, if you have any spam email asking you to log into banking or paypal, don't click the link, go to the site directly and log in.

Edit 2: A lot of comments are recommending you get a password manager if you think you have been hacked. Since this thread is on security and online safety, I thought I'd point it out up here.
