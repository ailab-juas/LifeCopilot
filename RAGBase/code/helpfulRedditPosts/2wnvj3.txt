LPT: Avoid using the word "just" in email and text to strengthen your messages

content:
The word "just" is often misused in text form due to the nature of the way we think. It naturally weakens your message and makes things sound overly nice.

For example things like:

"I was just doing that because..." comes off as validation seeking while "I was doing that because..." implies that you have no wavering opinion of why you did something.

"I just want some clarification on this going forward" is much weaker sounding compared to  "I want some clarification on this going forward".
