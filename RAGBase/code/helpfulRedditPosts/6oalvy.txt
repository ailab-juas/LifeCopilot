LPT: Casinos are an excellent way to help you scrape by if you're out of work/broke as hell

And no, I don't mean you should put your last 20 bucks in a slot machine and hope for the best. However, most casinos have a rewards/membership program that's free to join and can get you some free/discounted stuff that can be a huge help. I did this when I was being a loser bum for a year (long story). I was lucky enough to have 3 casinos within a few miles of each other. All 3 had free membership programs, and every 2 weeks (once a month for one of the casinos) I would get $10 worth of free play. I would take that and go to a penny keno machine and play 5 spots betting a nickel per spin. This would get me *minumum* 8-10 dollars, and if I was lucky 40-50. That meant worst case scenario I could swing by these casinos every 2 weeks and walk out with around 30 bucks. I know that doesn't seem like much for all the trouble, but when you're broke and jobless it makes all the difference in the world.

On top of that, one of the casinos gave a voucher for either a free pastry (good sized ones too. Like massive cinnamon rolls and turnovers) or 2.50 cents of dining credit, *every single day.* Combine that with the fact that casinos have free fountain drinks and coffee on the floor and that means a free breakfast, every day. 

So basically it's free food and drink on the daily, plus some free cash in pocket every 2 weeks. Honestly, it'd be smart to do this even if you aren't a broke loser like I was!
