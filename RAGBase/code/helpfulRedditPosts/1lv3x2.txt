LPT: "...Would you like some company?" is the ultimate pick-up line for either gender.

content:
Start with a Hello, or Hi, or Howdy - whatever it is you say - then follow it up with this phrase. It's a yes or no question, and a very considerate and non-obtrusive one at that. It also immediately forces them to consider whether there is any chance they'd like to date you; even if they can't give you company now, you might still get some later. The keys with this first impression are to be kind, polite, and gentle. 

EDIT: If you're a lady, please make it clear that you're not a prostitute fairly early on. Just don't put out those vibes, and don't go after skeezy guys, and this shouldn't be too much of a problem. ITT: You learn that hookers say this phrase a lot (and with good reason!)
