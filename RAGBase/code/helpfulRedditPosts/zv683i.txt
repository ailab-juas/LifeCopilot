LPT: Get Your Mom (or Wife) a Christmas Stocking

content:
I recognize this tip is a little late, but very often the magic of Christmas comes from moms. If your family does stockings with goodies in them, get your mom one of them and you will very likely make her Christmas and make her feel appreciated. I did it this year for the first time and wish I had done it sooner!
