LPT: Paper due? Low on Black Ink? Change font color to dark Tan.

content:
Last night I was wrapping up a paper due for class and went to print. My black ink was low and the paper was difficult to read. I didn't have time to go and get more ink before turning it in so I improvised. I changed the font color in Word to a dark Tan and now you can read the paper just fine. The color difference between the dark Tan and black is almost indistinguishable. 

Neat trick for when you run low on black ink. This trick will require that you have some color ink left though.
