LPT: How to clean Oatmeal or other sticky/crusty things from a bowl. Put water and dish soap in the bowl and microwave for a minute or two.

content:
It loosens everything right up. Helps if you use a dish brush too. For someone who eats oatmeal almost every morning and leaves the bowl around for 30min to harden this works wonders.

Edit: The negative comments in this thread are ridiculous. Are people that bothered about my tip? This suggestion was meant for working in an office environment. I get busy at work, the dirty instant oatmeal bowl has to sit at my desk till I can get up and go clean it in the kitchen. It hardened, I want it cleaned quickly and then I store it back in my cabinet. Happy Friday everyone!
