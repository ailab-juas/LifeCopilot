YSK: at only 18inches under water, most bathing suit colors disappear. buying bright colors such as neon orange can dramatically increase the ability to see a drowning child

content:
Why YSK: according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control from 2010-2019. There is about 11 drowning deaths per day. For children ages 1-14, drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury death, after vehicle crashes. 


 Wearing high visibility colors instead of "trendy" colors can make a difference in being able to be seen in a drowning. In open water and lakes- the best colors are neon orange, neon yellow, neon green.  All other colors virtually disappear.  In a pool (photo above)- the best colors are neon orange and neon pink.  The worst colors are white and light blue.  Dark colors should be avoided as they could be could be mistaken for leaves, dirt, or a shadow at the bottom of the pool. 



  You can see the simulated test on these sites, including the open water one.
