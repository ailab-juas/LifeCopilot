LPT: People often insult each other with things they themselves are insecure about. Be careful that when you insult others you don't give them your personal silver bullet.

This is also a good way to get a read on others insecurities so you can help them.

Ex

If someone calls you a "girl" or tells you to "man up" that shows that they're insecure about their masculinity.

If someone calls you a snowflake it means they feel powerless.

If someone calls you selfish when you're not being selfish they are insecure about how they treat others.



I used these tactics for years while counseling children and they never fail.

Edit: the comments here provide some great examples of using your own insecurities to insult others

Edit: you also need to understand the difference between an insult and an observation. Telling someone they're selfish when they're genuinely being selfish isn't always an insult. It's only an insult if our main goal is to hurt them
