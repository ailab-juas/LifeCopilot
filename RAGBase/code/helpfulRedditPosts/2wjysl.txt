YSK that you can get 100 gb of free online storage with Microsoft for free.

content:
Sign up for Microsoft one drive. 
Then go and bing, Bing rewards and you can sign up for rewards when you do bing searches. I know they aren't as good as Google but there are incentives now. 
Then you can redeem one point for 100 gb of storage for 2 years. It ends 2/28 so hurry. Also check out their other rewards for doing bing searches.

Edit: I forgot to mention, if you download the app and backup your phone photos you get an extra 5 gb. It's really nice when upgrading to a new phone and all your photos are safe
