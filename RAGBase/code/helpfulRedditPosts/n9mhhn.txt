YSK: If you order from them, Amazon sellers can use your customer information to send otherwise unsolicited ads to your home.

Why YSK: To potentially limit unwanted ads.  
  
After getting ads mailed to me by Amazon sellers, I asked support if this is allowed since Googling yielded threads saying it violated their terms of service, especially if it directed you to a site that isn't Amazon. Amazon support told me explicitly that sellers are allowed to use order information for marketing purposes.  
  
Edit: I'm in the US and understand this may not apply to other countries. I'm also sure this order was fulfilled by Amazon and didn't ship from the seller.
