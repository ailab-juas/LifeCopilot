YSK: If you pay for turbotax using the 'pay with my refund' option, they charge you an additional $35!

content:
For starters, there are multiple free options outside of turbotax that you could use to file your taxes but in case you are going to use their paid version I don't want anyone spending an extra $35 just to have them take additional money from your refund.
