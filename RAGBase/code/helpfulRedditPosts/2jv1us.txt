Edit: For everyone saying stuff like "This is an LPT? What happened to this sub?", take a moment to consider when the last time you complemented, or showed a genuine interest in a co-worker, or fellow student that you usually don't talk to. You might find out its been longer than you thought, and someone out there could use it right about now.
