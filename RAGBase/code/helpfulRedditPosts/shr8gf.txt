LPT: Just because you sucked at learning/understanding math when you were in a high school, it doesn't mean you will suck at math when you are in your 30s and 40s. You might find you are for more attentive in your older age. This goes for most areas of academic studies.

This was explained to me by a 50something high level geologist who went to school for geology in her early 40s after working a job she hater her whole life. Now she travels the world and studies long dried  prehistoric river beds. You just might have not had the right motivation or mindset for learning when you were younger.
