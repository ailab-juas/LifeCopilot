LPT: If you receive a gift you think is undeserved, decline only once. Accept it the second time it is offered.

content:
Or you can accept it the first time, but never continue to decline a gift, even if it may make things a bit rough on the giving party. They went out of their way to give something to you, and it would make them happy if you accepted it. Its also rude to decline gifts, usually.

My grandpa told me "If somebody gives you something you dont want then throw it away."

Needless to say it struck home, and I take his gifts with minimal decline.
