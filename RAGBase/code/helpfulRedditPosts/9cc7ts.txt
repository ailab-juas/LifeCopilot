YSK: For a few select languages, the DeepL website offers near flawless translations

content:
If you need texts translated between French, English, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch or Polish, [DeepL.com](https://DeepL.com) offers extremely good translations. It goes beyond simple word by word translations and properly transcribes more complexe expressions and syntaxes than any other translator I've ever used. Highly recommend it.
