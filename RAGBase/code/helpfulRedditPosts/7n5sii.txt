YSK that if your phone mysteriously stops working, don't try to get into your bank account.

Sorry for the lack of details, I'm trying not to dox myself.

Long story short, someone convinced a cell phone carrier to port my phone number to a phone they owned without interacting with me. They then waited until I needed to pay bills, which based on the time of month was today. I signed in using 2 factor authentication in which they got the text message code instead of me. How they translated that code into access to my online bank account, I cannot explain, but neither could anyone at my bak or cell phone company, and I used to work for that bank, and before that, my cellphone company, and I can't either. I couldn't access my bills, because my cell phone stopped working, prompting me to think my sim card shit the bed, so I just used a different method. While I was paying my bills, some asshole siphoned off about a grand from my account. The bank is covering the thousand dollars and I am definitely losing my cellphone number, but it's a minor inconvenience compared to actually losing a thousand dollars. Given my employment past, I feel like I should know better and I'm pretty ashamed of it, but both my bank and my cellphone company have said this has gotten really popular in the last few weeks so I wanted to bring attention to the problem.

TL;DR: if a banking related inconvenience seems like a perfect storm, stop what you're doing before you give up too much info.
