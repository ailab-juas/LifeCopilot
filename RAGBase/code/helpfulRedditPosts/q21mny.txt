YSK There is an amazing app called Be My Eyes where you can volunteer to do sight seeing tasks for blind people via your smartphone.

Why YSK, the app will ring with a call and connect you to the video of a blind person who needs your assistance. I’ve been asked to help match clothes and other task like reading blood sugar results. Your phone number stays private and if you don’t answer the call it goes to another volunteer.
