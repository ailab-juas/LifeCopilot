Includes free licenses for Visual Studio, Windows Server, SQL servers, free ebooks, and more.

Even if you're not a developer, you can [use Server as a desktop OS](http://www.win2012workstation.com/desktop-experience/) if you don't want to pay for Windows 8/8.1

Edit: stirrah and TheThirdBlackGuy are right, your university has to be enrolled in the program to access the software
