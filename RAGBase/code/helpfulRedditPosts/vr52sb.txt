YSK More Pets are lost on the 4th of July (in the US) than any other day of the year. Please keep a close eye on your Pets tonight, even if they have not been spooked by Fireworks in the past

content:
Not surprising to most, but just a reminder that many Pets get spooked by fireworks, some more than others. It's smart to take precautions for ***all*** pets, regardless of how unafraid they may have been of loud noises in the past. Pets that have been fine in past years can still be unexpectedly spooked.

For instance, our Senior Golden Retriever has become much more spooked by loud noises in his advanced age, when in the past he was never nearly as spooked.

Here's some tips copied and pasted from [This Link](http://patch.com/california/temecula/4th-july-fireworks-terrifying-pets-safety-tips-follow) (Focused on Dogs, but most tips can be applied to other pets as well):

&gt;1: Exercise will help your dog relax, so take your dog for a walk and a potty break before the fireworks or festivities begin. Even if you’re in your yard, you may want to leash your dog in case of unexpected noise.

&gt;2: Find a safe place indoors for your pet to stay. Ambient noise from a TV, radio, fan or A/C unit can help make pets feel safe.

&gt;3: Keep your windows closed.

&gt;4: Avoid bringing your dog to your local Independence Day parade.

&gt;5: Inspect your fence for openings.

&gt;6: Be certain your dog’s tag is readable and up-to-date, his collar is properly fitted and, if your dog has a microchip, the information in the microchip is accurate. Microchips to do not provide GPS or tracking information, but contain important information about your pet, and how to contact you.

&gt;7: Create a quiet place for your dog or cat. Make sure it is cool enough, comfortable enough and away from the celebrations. Once you have located the spot, make it off-limits to guests.

&gt;8: If your animal requires prescriptions to cope with the fireworks, make sure you get them well before the Fourth of July holiday. Most veterinarians are closed for the holiday and emergency clinics will not prescribe tranquilizers.

&gt;9: If you're having or attending a cook-out with a pet, remind guests to watch their plates and to properly dispose of their garbage. A steak bone/chicken bone or a corn cob is appetizing but can be deadly to your dog.

&gt;10: Post notes or signs on back gates or front and rear doors that an animal is present and to be careful to close doors and gates when entering or exiting.

&gt;11: Make sure that your pet has on its rabies tags for identification purposes and she is wearing a collar and tag with your name and phone number in case of escape. Most pet stores, such as Petco or Petsmart, have machines inside the store where you can make pet ID tags on the spot.

&gt;12: Watch where your dog or cat go before the Fourth of July when the neighborhood hooligans start blowing off fireworks. See where your pet seeks quiet and make that their space.

Why YSK: The night of July 4th in the US sees the most cases of lost/killed animals, with July 5th being the busiest day for Animal Shelters.
 
I know the 4th of July can be a very stressful time for Veterans as well, but I'll leave that to someone else with much more knowledge on that subject. 

Hope you and your pets have a safe and happy Independence Day!
