YSK: If you find a co-worker to be completely wrong about something especially in a meeting or work situation, it’s better to make yourself the point of reference

content:
For example,

* **Bad**- "I think you have got it completely wrong!!!!!"

* **Better**- "I don’t think I understood it correctly. From what I understand, it says this _____. Am I wrong on this point?"
