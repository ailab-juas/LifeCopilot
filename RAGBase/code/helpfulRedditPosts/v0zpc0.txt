LPT if you don't want to "offend" a vet today, don't say "Happy Memorial Day!" to us.

content:
I'm a combat vet of OEF/OIF and I lost friends, colleagues, and subordinates in both theater's, all holding special, if different meanings to me. I understand those who haven't served in the military not understanding it, and I know it doesn't come from a place of offense, but, I will be spending today relaxing w my family, grilling, swimming, and drinking beer. Too many good men I knew wont be. As such, I will also be intermittently thinking about all of those ppl throughout the day and feeling a little bit of survivors guilt.

So have fun, enjoy the day off, but, perhaps, be a little considerate knowing that today is not the happiest of days for those who served w the reason for the holiday; the fallen soldiers and sailors who sacrificed their lives in service to their nation. Thank you.
