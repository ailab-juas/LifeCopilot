LPT: At the end of your AirBNB stay, don't bother making the bed. Instead, roll your used sheets into a ball.

content:
I'm a host and fairly consistently, guests will make their bed before they leave on the next leg of their journey.   While it is done because people are kind and want to leave the house neat, but it's counter productive. 

When you arrive, you expect clean sheets.  Most hosts want to provide you with clean sheets too. This means that after you make the bed (probably the first time you've made the bed during your entire stay), the first is immediately going to strip the bed, ruining you're hard work.

Instead, if you want to help out (which is entirely unnecessary, but you're good people so you probably want to do it anyway), strip the bed of your sheets and pillow covers and leave them in a ball at the end of your bed.  This way, the host can just grab them and toss them in the laundry machine.
