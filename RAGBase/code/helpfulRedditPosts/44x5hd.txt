YSK: Doctors are not perfect. You need to be your own advocate.

content:
Here's my story:  At 12 I discovered fist sized lymphnodes under each armpit region. When I went to the clinic (low income) they didn't even draw blood. They did an ultrasound (useless) and sent me home with Penicillin. After a few years, they got bigger and my body got more tired and bruised.

At 17 I got diagnosed with Lymphoma, then Evan's Syndrome, then Lupus. I've been in and out of the hospital, I've dealt with medical professionals. And if you don't advocate / speak up for yourself, they can run you right over. 

Ask questions. Get second opinions. If something is wrong, insist on tests. Doctors are not infallible and they DO get lazy and misanthropic like us all. 

This doesn't mean try to diagnose yourself, it means what it means - get second opinions and don't put all your eggs in one basket.
