YSK the various reasons people become homeless

... and who they are. 

So often we see people assume every homeless person is a drug addict who got lost along the way, or someone who made a series of bad choices and ended up homeless. 

Of course this is true for many cases; addiction to alcohol and hard drugs can leave someone at great risk of being homeless, but there are many other factors you should take into consideration which people often don't consider or don't know about. I think it's important to know about the various reasons people become homeless not just to reduce stigma of the homeless, but to prevent yourself falling into the traps too. 

So many of us see homeless people and think it could never happen to us, but you know what? I bet one day they looked at a homeless person and thought the same thing themselves.

For example, [veterans](http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics/), [people with brain injuries](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/28/new-research-shows-half-of-all-homeless-have-suffered-traumatic-brain-injury.html), or [LGBT people](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/americas-shame-40-of-homeless-youth-are-lgbt-kids/) are often left out of the discussion entirely despite making up a substantal percentage of the homeless population.

According to the [Homelessness in the USA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States) Wiki page it is estimated that 1.56 million people, or one in every 200 Americans, experienced homelessness and found shelter between Oct. 1, 2008 and Sept. 30, 2009. 

On a single night in January 2009, 643,000 people were homeless. Nearly two-thirds stayed in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program and the other third were living on the street, in an abandoned building, or another place not meant for human habitation.

A typical sheltered homeless person is a single, middle-aged man and a member of a minority group. Of all those who sought emergency shelter or transitional housing during 2009, the following characteristics were observed:

• 78 percent of all sheltered homeless persons are adults.

• 61 percent are male.

• 62 percent are members of a minority group.

• 38 percent are 31-to-50 years old.

• 64 percent are in one-person households.

• 38 percent have a disability.

Some estimates from various sources on the characteristics and number of homeless people:

**Familial composition**

* 23% are families with children—the fastest growing segment.
* 51.3% are single males.
* 24.7% are single females.
* 5% are minors unaccompanied by adults.

**Marital Status**

* 1.37 million (or 39%) of the total homeless population are children under the age of 18
* 24% are married.
* 76% are single.
* 67.5% are single males within the single percentage.
* 32.5% are single females within the single percentage.

**Ethnicity**

* 42% are African American (over-represented 3.23x compared to 13% of general population).
* 38% are Caucasian (under-represented 0.53x compared to 72% of general population).
* 20% are Hispanic (over-represented 1.25x compared to 16% of general population).
* 4% are Native American (over-represented 4x compared to 1% of general population).
* 2% are Asian-American (under-represented 0.4x compared to 5% of general population).


**Health Concerns**


* 39% report some form of mental health problems
* 22% are considered to have serious mental illnesses, or are disabled.
* 38% have alcohol abuse problems.
* 26% have other substance abuse problems.
* 3% report having HIV/AIDS.
* 26% report acute health problems other than HIV/AIDS such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, or sexually transmitted infections.
* 46% report chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or cancer.
* 55% report having no health insurance (compared to 27% of general population).
* 58% report having trouble getting enough food to eat.

**Education**


* 38% have less than a High School diploma.
* 34% have a High School diploma or equivalent (G.E.D.).
* 28% have more than a High School education.

**Total Number**

As many as 3.5 million people experience homelessness in a given year (1% of the entire U.S. population or 10% of its poor), and about 842,000 people in any given week.  Most were homeless temporarily. The chronically homeless population (those with repeated episodes or who have been homeless for long periods) fell from 175,914 in 2005 to 123,833 in 2007

**Common Causes of Homelessness**:


* The failure of urban housing projects to provide safe, secure, and affordable housing to the poor.

* Additionally, many workers cannot afford to live where they work, and even in moderately priced communities housing costs require a large portion of household income.


* The deinstitutionalization movement from the 1950s onwards in state mental health systems, to shift towards 'community-based' treatment of the mentally ill, as opposed to long-term commitment in institutions.

* There is disproportionally higher prevalence of mental disorders relative to other disease groups within homeless patient populations at both inpatient hospitals and hospital-based emergency departments.

* Redevelopment and gentrification activities instituted by cities across the country through which low-income neighborhoods are declared blighted and demolished to make way for projects that generate higher property taxes and other revenue, creating a shortage of housing affordable to low-income working families, the elderly poor, and the disabled.


* The failure of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide effective mental health care and meaningful job training for many homeless veterans, particularly those of the Vietnam War.

* Deprived of normal childhoods, nearly half of foster children in the United States become homeless when they are released from foster care at age 18.

* Natural disasters that destroy homes: hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, etc. Places of employment are often destroyed too, causing unemployment and transience.

* People who have served time in prison, have abused drugs and alcohol, or have a history of mental illness find it difficult to impossible to find employment for years at a time because of the use of computer background checks by potential employers.
    

* According to the Institution of Housing in 2005, the U.S. Government has focused 42% more on foreign countries rather than homeless Americans, including homeless veterans.

* People who are hiding in order to evade law enforcement.

* Adults and children who flee domestic violence.
 
* Teenagers who flee or are thrown out by parents who disapprove of their child's sexual orientation or gender identity. A 2010 study by the Center for American Progress shows that a disproportionately high number of homeless youth (between 20–40%) identify as LGBTQ.

* Overly complex building code that makes it difficult for most people to build. Traditional huts, cars, and tents are illegal, classified as substandard and may be removed by government, even though the occupant may own the land. Land owner cannot live on the land cheaply, and so sells the land and becomes homeless.

* Foreclosures of homes, including foreclosure of apartment complexes which displaces tenants renting there.
    

* Evictions from rented property.
    
* Lack of support from friends or family.
    
* Individuals who prefer homelessness and wish to remain off the grid for political and ideological purposes. Often self-identified as Gutter Punks or Urban Survivalists.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development rarely reports on this counter-cultural movement since Gutter Punks and similar individuals often refuse to participate in governmental studies and do not seek governmental assistance for ideological or political purposes.
    

* Lack of resources in place in the communities to help aid in prevention of homelessness before it becomes a crisis.


So while it's true some homeless are homeless through personal choice, or are addicts who didn't receive adequate treatment in time, please remember the next time you walk passed a homeless person and look down on them that maybe they may have been an LGBT teen who was kicked out in the 70s, or a veteran who didn't receive adequate mental health care, or a child who fled from home because of domestic or sexual abuse or neglect, or were displaced after a natural disaster, or a whole host of other reasons beyond their control.


Remember that it can happen to you too, and as much as you think it will never happen, it can. 

Be aware, be safe and be kind!
