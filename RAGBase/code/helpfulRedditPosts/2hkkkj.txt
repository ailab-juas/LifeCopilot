LPT: When delivering a speech, print it and change the text color every four lines to keep your place.

This one comes from gramps. It's how he knows where he was when he speaks at church and keeps looking down at the paper, then up. I would add that it's best to stick to big, clear font and dark colors, and to do as many practice deliveries in front of a mirror (and/or friend) as you can stand, so you gain confidence in your ability to recall what comes next. If it works for acting, it'll work for speech-giving.

*(Bonus tip: for stage fright shakiness, you can tense up every muscle in your body all at once, hold it for ten seconds, then let them all go at once and repeat until the shaking stops. I've had to use this many times. Usually, once you get in the swing of things, the nervousness goes way down.)

edit: a wild gold appears! Thanks, stranger.
