LPT: You don’t have to have a drinking problem to benefit from a break from alcohol.

content:
Title. Taking a break can be very beneficial, even if you don’t have a problem, or don’t think you drink too much.

EDIT: That is to also say that taking a break does not mean you have a problem. Don’t use the excuse “I don’t have a problem” to avoid taking a break.

EDIT 2: As u/derossx pointed out, taking a break is not safe for everyone. If you are drinking so much that you suffer symptoms of withdrawal (https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-treatments#1) please look into getting help before choosing to take a break.
