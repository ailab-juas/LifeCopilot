title:
LPT: if you’re working tonight while daylight savings is rolling back an hour, make sure to keep track of that time so that your employer doesn’t cheat you out of an hour!

content:
This is especially important if you’re working in the food or bar industry! The time will go back and it’ll show that you got done way earlier. A lot of employees don’t catch this and they end up losing out on an hour of pay! Just keep that in mind friends and I hope everyone has a good night!
