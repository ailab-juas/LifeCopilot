LPT: Don't worry about being too old or too young. Age is usually a legal structure and industry benefit. Have fun, watch your favorite movies, listen to your music, eat your food, do your hobbies, make friends and leave toxic ones. If everyone's safe and you can do something, DO IT.

It's okay if you're reaching 30, if you're not 30 yet. 50. Whatever. You can still be a mentor and help people. You can still have a mentor and get help. You can have fun in old or new ways. Your drawing doesn't have to be at a tier just because you're big. You don't have to be old to not understand new shows or to grow up with something more vintage. You can be little and big at the same time, eat a grown up meal and take a nap after, eat nuggets and watch a grown up movie. Make like-minded friends, have a sleepover, play Minecraft. Each day can be different. You don't have to be bad or good at something just because of age- as long as you're you and you do your best when it matters.

Sure there are things you're missing out on but other people who suppress are also and it's easy to lose the meaning of fun. Youth is capacity and exploration, it isn't doing/not doing something, not a number. Looks don't define you. You determine your value. 

As long as everyone is safe, go for it. If someone makes you feel out of place and they're not trying to help you as a person, it's not going anywhere, don't feel obligated to keep up. You only need the perfect home or car or fashion if that's what you want. You don't have to be married with a kid like your old classmates, you don't have to be a jock or cheerleader with 1k likes. If you want to be more than what you are, then work towards it, you're not old or lame or a nerd. You don't have to give up your interests. Your job is not an old person one, neither are your interests. Really you can go to the pool or ride your bike or go to the butterfly enclosure or get that action figure, have ice cream after a long day of School, your parents can't tell you no.
