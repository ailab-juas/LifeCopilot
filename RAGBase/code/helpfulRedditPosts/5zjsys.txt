YSK: It is not safe to use document shredding services at places like Staples and FedEx office

content:
Many people bring their secure documents to office supply stores for shredding. Its affordable, usually under $1 a pound. The problem is that they don't do the shredding. They place the documents into a basic plastic garbage bin with a very cheap lock. A friend works at one of these stores and last week, they had a break-in and the only thing taken was that bin. Who knows what critical documents and data were in there.

If you want to ensure your documents get shredded and you have too many for your home shredder, go to a place that will shred it for you on the spot. Banks and other organizations also often have free shredding events where they bring a big machine to location and shred on the spot.
