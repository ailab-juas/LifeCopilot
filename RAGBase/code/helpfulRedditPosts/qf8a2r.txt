LPT: If you have a loved one that is a tipped service worker and they wait on/serve you, TIP THEM!!

content:
When I was young and waiting tables, my mom, dad and brother came in to my restaurant for dinner. They got excellent service, and we all had a fun time. But when they left, my dad did not leave a tip. I was CRUSHED. Not only because it felt like my dad did not value the work I was doing, or felt I did a good job, but because in waiting on them I missed out on other tables that would have tipped me, and I was taxed on what I should have been tipped. So, it cost me money to wait on my family. Money that I, as a young mom, did not have. 

So, if you ever find yourself in the position of being waited on/served by a loved one, tip them and tip them well!
