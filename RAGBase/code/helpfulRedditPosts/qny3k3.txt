LPT: If you use the services of a housekeeper, pay them more than the going rate if you are able to and always treat them with respect. They will reward you with loyalty and respect in return.

Working mother here who uses the services of a housekeeper weekly. My friend made fun of me for "paying my housekeeper too much." I had one housekeeper for 9 years until she retired from physical work and have had another for 3 years so far. My housekeepers are very loyal to me. I pay more than the going rate and pay Christmas bonuses. If my housekeeper gets another job, I will be the last client she drops. I will be the first client to pick my hours from her schedule. She comes in my house and handles my stuff, and this needs to be a person I 100% trust. My friend who pays the lowest rate, meanwhile, cycles through bad housekeepers who show up late and quit for other jobs. I even paid mine during the Covid lockdown, when I told her not to come to work. Treating housekeepers with respect is also just the right thing to do.
