LPT: Drill holes in the bottom of your outside garbage cans &amp; stencil your house number on them.

content:
I read a TIFU titled something like "TIFU by emptying a rain filled garbage can".  I live in a row house with "supercans" from the city.  If we get a Drencho, they are impossible to move as they are too heavy.  Drill holes in the bottom so that they drain, and stencil your house number so that your neighbors will help you keep track of them. Otherwise, they will take the light ones (aka, the ones that drain) when it rains on garbage day.  
Have a great day.
