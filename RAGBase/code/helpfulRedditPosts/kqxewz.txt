LPT - the best way to fix a bad sleeping pattern isn't by going to bed early, it's by getting up early

content:
I'm one of those people who constantly find themself up at 5am watching some men build a swimming pool out of dirt. I used to try and fix my sleeping schedule by going to bed early the next day but obviously I couldn't sleep because I had slept late previous morning. It then took me several days and potentially and all-nighter to fix my sleeping pattern.

Recently, I've discovered that the best way to recover from this is by setting an alarm for the morning. Yes you may be a bit tired during the day, but it means you will fall asleep earlier that night and hey presto you are back to being awake in the day time.

Edit - thank you for the awards! I didnt expect my first big post to be about sleep deprivation but I guess it does make sense.
