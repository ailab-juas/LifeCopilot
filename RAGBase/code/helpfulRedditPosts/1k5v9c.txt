LPT: If you rarely dress formally, keep your accessories in your formal shoe box

content:
I only wear a suit and tie once or twice a year, so I keep my nice wallet (with some cash in it) and watch, cufflinks, a plain tie and plain socks in the shoebox with my shoes. I've been going to a few weddings recently and it's been handy to just grab the box and my suit and go instead of hunting around for things you put in a safe place and forgot about.
