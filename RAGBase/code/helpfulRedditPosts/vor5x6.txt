YSK Many gas station pumps with screens showing advertisements can be muted

Why YSK: Don't be trapped at the pump with ads blaring.

Once you have started pumping simply try pressing any of the menu select buttons on either side of the screen to mute. Not all gas stations allow this, but I have found most in my region do. It's not always the same button, so try them all.
