LPT: Do you grind your teeth or play rough sports? You can order a custom mouthguard by mail and save 75% off the price at your dentist.

content:
These can cost over $500 from a dentist. But some of the same labs that dentists use also serve consumers directly. For $150, they send an easy-to-use kit to make the molds you send back. The guard I received fits better than the one I had made by my dentist, and at a fraction of the price.

EDIT: The one I received fits over my top teeth, but they also get a mold of your lower teeth, so they can make the bottom of the guard fit around them, which discourages grinding (not just protecting)

EDIT: people have asked for the link. I'm deliberately not sharing a specific product because this isn't a plug and that violates the rules. If you're interested, you can find a lab that offers this in just a few minutes.
