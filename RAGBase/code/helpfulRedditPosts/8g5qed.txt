YSK that if you need documents scanned and sent electronically, you can just use your cell phone

content:
There are many apps out there that will produce scanner-like quality pictures of documents. I cannot tell the difference if a document was scanned by my scanner or by my phone. You can then mail the scanned documents to yourself and send them electronically. The one I personally use is CamScaner  but there are other options. The app autocrops and adds a scanner filter. These days not many people have scanners and they are expensive anyways. Just use your phone.

edit: I forgot to mention that CamScanner is free and so are other many apps. Some do cost money though or give you only a few scans.
