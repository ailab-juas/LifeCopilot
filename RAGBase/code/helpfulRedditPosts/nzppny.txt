LPT: If your with people and don’t want to drink alcohol. Keep a glass of water or such in your hands. It will put you more at ease and will signal others that you already have a drink.

I’ve been sober for 15 years and this trick works like a charm.

Edit.:  Holy crap!! Thank you all for your kind comments and support. 

For those of you commenting that one should just “grow a pair and not care”, Im glad you have not suffered anxiety, depression, alcoholism, addiction and the hundreds of other things that make people uncomfortable not drinking in a society which expects people to drink.
