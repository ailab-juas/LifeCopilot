title:
LPT: When attending a funeral for the relative (spouse, child, or immediate family member) of a loved one, set a alert on your phone to ask the bereaved how they are doing on the 3 month, 6 month, and 1 year anniversary. After the first alert, you will likely be the only one to ever ask again.
