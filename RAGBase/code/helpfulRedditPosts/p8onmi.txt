LPT: If you need to buy a young child a present please, for the love of god, avoid gifting musical instruments or toys with sound, unless otherwise requested by the parents.

content:
Additional tip for parents: Clear plastic tape can be placed over the voice / sound box of electronic toys to muffle the sound to a more reasonable level without having to completely remove the batteries.

EDIT: **Pro-tips from other commenters**

- Ask parents as to what their toy preferences are. Not everyone has abundant storage space for toys. Likewise toys with small parts may not be ideal for families who also have small children and small toys may get easily broken or lost

- If you get a loud or undesirable toy from family members, let family members know how excited you are to have the toy stay at said relatives house for when the child visits 

- Not all children love musical and loud toys despite anecdotal comments that say otherwise. Some children are hypersensitive and can be easily overwhelmed, anxious, and overstimulated by toys that would otherwise be “fun” for other children

- From the tip offered by /u/risssa391 gifting children experiences or activities far outweighs tangible things. Kids just want to spend time together and feel involved in your life and those memories last a lifetime
