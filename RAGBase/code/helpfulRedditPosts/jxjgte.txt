YSK: Pulling pranks on people with intense phobias can cause severe harm.

content:
Why YSK: You can make someone MORE afraid of something by pranking them with it and can literally traumatize them. I speak from personal experience. I have intense arachnophobia. I literally will have a panic attack if a spider is anywhere near me. I no longer tell people this, because when I do they are more likely to try and go out of their way to prank me. I’ve had LIVING spiders thrown at me, placed in my hair, put in with my things and I’ve been chased with them. This has only greatly increased my fear. One “prank” caused such an intense panic attack that I could not breathe and had to be laid down or else I would have passed out, and all because someone put a house spider on my shoulder.

TLDR: Don’t prank people by exposing them to their phobias. They need slow treatment to overcome their fears, not sudden jolts of anxiety.
