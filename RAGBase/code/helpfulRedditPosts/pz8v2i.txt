YSK: Boiling Hot Water Will Shrink Stretched Out T-Shirt Collars

content:
Why YSK: When t-shirt collars are stretched out, they can be shrunken by washing them in hot water then dip just the collars in boiling hot or nearly boiling water for 2-3 minutes (BE VERY CAREFUL!) then lay flat to dry in the sun. The collar will shrink back to nearly its original shape. Never hang t-shirts on hangers, always fold and store flat.

**WARNING: BOILING HOT WATER WILL SCALD EASILY. BE VERY CAREFUL AND KEEP KIDS AND PETS AWAY.**
