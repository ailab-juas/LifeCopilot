title:
YSK if you ever lose a valuable metal item like a ring or a set of keys, there is a worldwide organization of volunteer metal detectorists that will come to you and help you find the item

content:
It's a wonderful organization called [Ring Finders](https://theringfinders.com/). They have finders in countries all over the world, and have recovered over 6000 items so far.

Edit: Since the post title cannot be changed, let it be known that not all ring finders are strictly volunteers; some do charge for their services. Also, this is not an ad and I am not affiliated with this organization. I don't even own a metal detector. Jeez.
