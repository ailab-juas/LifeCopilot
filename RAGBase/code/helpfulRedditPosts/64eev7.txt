LPT: Guy, keep a mini sewing kit in the suit you wear to weddings.

content:
If your like me and have a "go to" suit for weddings and other formal occasions, throw a cheap sewing kit (dollar tree) into the breast pocket. Although I haven't had a wardrobe malfunction, almost every wedding I've ever been a part of (and I a couple I just attended) had an unexpected mishap where I was able to save the day by providing a sewing kit (brides maid dresses have flimsy straps). 

I don't know how to sew, I just hand off the kit to whom ever needs it or seems to know what to do and look like the hero.
