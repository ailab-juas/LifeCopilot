LPT: When travelling, take pictures of signs at the places you visit.

content:
E.g. street signs, restaurants or caf√©s you liked or maybe the street you lived on. When you look at the pictures later you'll remember the names of the places and the sign-pictures will also make a natural chaptering when looking through your pictures. 

Names are easy to forget over time and might be useful if you want to recommend places to friends later on.
