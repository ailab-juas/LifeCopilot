YSK that if you plan to join the military or are in the military, you should insist on being seen for any injury or perceived injury. Later in life, if you have complications from an injury, there will be a documented source for the complications.

Why YSK - It's difficult to get care if the docs don't know what is causing the issues.

I got out years ago after being airborne.  Due to the nature of falling out of planes, concussions are not uncommon.  Years later, I'm having moderate memory issues.  But because being seen for medical issues was highly frowned upon, I have no proof for what is likely causing issues today.

Edit: This could also apply to any occupation.
