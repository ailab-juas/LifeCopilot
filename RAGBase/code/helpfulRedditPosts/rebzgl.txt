LPT: make the gifts from Santa the smaller presents. Let the big expensive ones be from you and the family.

content:
This will make such a difference when the kids are back in their classrooms and in their social lives. The inevitable, “what did YOU get from Santa?” Question will come up, and Santa doesn’t just visit houses where the families are well off.  Comparisons can make a kid feel really bad if they didn’t get something huge from Santa. Stuff like that sticks with you when you grow up.
