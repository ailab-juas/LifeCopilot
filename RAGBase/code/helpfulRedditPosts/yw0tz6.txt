LPT: If your home is freezing and your landlord locks the thermostat with a plastic lock box, place an ice pack on top of the lock box. It will trick the thermostat into thinking it’s freezing and kick the heat on to adequate levels.

Thanks y’all for the support! 

If you’re wondering if this is legal- it is where I live. Idk what more I can tell you. 

If you’re telling me to move, I completely agree and I am moving when the time comes. 

If you’re telling me to get a space heater or heated blanket- I have them both. 

If you’re telling me about the law of the minimum and maximum temperature- I know about all of that. The thermostat is in a warm place and the living area is not warm. This hack adjusts the temp a few degrees…enough to make the room just right. I’m not freezing to death, it’s just uncomfortable. 

There are people in this world that are freezing with a locked thermostat. This is for them. Apparently people in offices and classrooms too.

Oh, and for everyone saying I need to dress like it’s winter- I have a minor circulation condition that makes my hands and feet impressively cold. I dress like it’s below zero all year round to try to keep my hands warm and not as cracked as they get from the cold. So I am not walking around naked…ok sometimes I am naked but in general I am clothed heavily.
