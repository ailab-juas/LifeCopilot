YSK, a lot of small restaurants (especially cultural restaurants) that are open on holidays aren’t open cause they don’t celebrate the holidays, they’re just trying to survive.

This one’s going to be kinda lame. But it hits home for me. 
Why YSK: behind most mom and pop family restaurants whether it be Asian restaurants, Mexican, American etc; is a family that doesn’t want to open on holidays. Behind those mom and pop shops, are usually kids wishing their family could get together for a holiday for once.

I bring this up because my family once had a restaurant; And on one Thanksgiving day, instead of having our own family dinner we had to open the restaurant. A lady came in for a catering order and I heard her tell her husband “oh don’t worry; these people don’t celebrate thanksgiving”. Now, she wasn’t being racist; she was just ignorant to our culture. 

Of course we celebrate American holidays.  But many family restaurants open cause it’s survival. We didn’t have a “Make up” day for Thanksgiving. We just had to deal with it. At home are the kids watching tv  sitcoms of thanksgiving specials, living vicariously. While mom and dad are trying to provide. 

So if you do visit a family restaurant this Thanksgiving, please be extra kind.

Edit: a lot of opinions in the comments derived from misunderstanding. I wanted to clarify that this is not just “ethnic” restaurants. And yes, I understand that not everyone celebrates the same holidays. 
My point with this post was just to advise that we shouldn’t judge right away, that we should take a few moments to appreciate mom and pop shops, and to shed light on what may be going on behind the scenes. 

This is not a post saying “do/don’t go to restaurants on holidays”.
