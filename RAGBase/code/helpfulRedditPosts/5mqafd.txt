LPT: Did your kids get some outdoor gear/equipment? Before putting it together. Take the nuts and bolts to the local hardware and upgrade them to stainless steel. Pics in comments.

Thought this might be some useful information for anyone who is about to built some outdoor stuff for the kids. I put my kids play set together a couple of years ago and although the set itself is fine. The fixings it came with rusted to death.

edit: Thanks so much everyone. Great way to start the year. First gold ever. Thank you kind redditor. 

edit2: I'm being smashed by engineers saying this is a bad idea because "read comments below" please note: I'm talking about holding together small, mostly cosmetic bits and pieces of play equipment. Not load bearing, structural things. Many people have mentioned zinc plated and galvanised nuts and bolts as an alternative to stainless steel. If you are concerned then seek professional advice.
