LPT. Lost your android phone? Here is how to remotely make your android phone ring on full volume even if it's set to silent. Bonus tip: how to set it up to remotely lock and erase your data if it gets stolen.

content:
Go to the google play store on a computer then select &gt; settings (cog in the top right) &gt; Android device manager &gt; click "ring"

Your phone will now ring on loud for 2 minutes even if you set it to silent.

Bonus tip. Set up the "lock and erase" function then if your phone is stolen you can lock it up it and make it into a paperweight that no shop will touch. Plus all your data will get formatted. No more worries.

**edit** for clarification, both these tips are done through the settings in the play store on a computer.

**edit 2** For those who couldn't follow the instructions (I am not the most eloquently succinct, sorry.).... [here's a link] (https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager)

** I have it on good authority that this only works with Gmail addresses. sorry for the confusion.
