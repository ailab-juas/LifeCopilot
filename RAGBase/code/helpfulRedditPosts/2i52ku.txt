LPT: Remove private data from your photos before uploading them

content:
Your photo contains EXIF data, which contains phone brand &amp; model, camera serial number for some models, GPS coordinates if enabled, whether flash was used or not, focal length, etc.
  
Some websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Imgur remove EXIF before making your photos public, but for other websites (such as Flickr, Picassa, Google+), you need to remove your EXIF by yourself before uploading. This way, the info won't be publicized along with the image.
