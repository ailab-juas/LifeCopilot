LPT: Keep a bottle of water next to your bed. Drink it first thing in the morning and it will help you wake up.

You don't have to down the entire bottle. A little less than half will do the trick. Especially if you need to motivate yourself to go to the gym if you use "too tired this AM" as an excuse.
