LPT: Other people's attitude isn't your problem. You are not their mother/father, it isn't your job to manage their mood, or fix it and just because they are being a jerk to you, it has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with them. Don't let them drag you into that negative space.

If you don't do this you can end up bogged down a lot in other people's crap.
