YSK: When writing an email, you should fill out recipient last. Why YSK: So that you don’t accidentally send an unfinished email or without intended attachments.

Unfortunately Ive learned this from making mistakes in the past and sending unfinished emails only having to continue the email and apologize for the mistake. Its a very simple habit to integrate into your workflow and hopefully you’ve never made the mistake to begin with. I promise if you make it once, you will probably have this as your solution in the future. I wish someone had told me. 

I love this channel and the posts.
Be good to each other :)
Much love to all
