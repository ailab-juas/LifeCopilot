LPT: If you found out someone made a mistake at work, tell them first before reporting it.

I work in the software industry, and mistakes are a common thing. It seems that some people like mentioning other people wrongs like we are all counting points or something. I rather go to the person, point out the issue and suggest any solutions if I have.
