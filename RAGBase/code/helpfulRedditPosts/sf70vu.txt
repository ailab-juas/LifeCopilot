LPT- If you are someone who gets anxious driving to new places, if possible take a practice drive

content:
I am someone who gets a bit anxious driving to new places, usually it's for appointments. I found it really helps to take a practice drive a day or two before I have to go so I can get familiar with the route and the surrounding area. If I cannot, I always make sure to leave a half hour to 45 minutes early so I can take my time and have extra time in case I get lost.
