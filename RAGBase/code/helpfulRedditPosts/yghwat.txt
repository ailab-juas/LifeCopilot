YSK You do not have to put corrective lenses (contacts) directly over your pupil. You can just pull the lid down, pop them on the white of the eye, and blink.

Why YSK: I see many people trying to stare directly at the contact as their finger moves towards their eye. It is second-hand torture watching people spend 5 minutes trying to do this.  I had a friend who was yelled at by a contact lens technician for not staring directly at the finger going into her eye. She didn’t wear contacts for years as a result.


So, here’s the procedure I use, it takes seconds:


- Wash your hands, obviously.  Some people say that if you don’t dry your hands, bacteria can come through your faucets and therefore infect your eye.  i’m more worried about people who do not remove their lenses regularly.  Personally, I find that having a slightly wet finger helps to get the lens off my finger once I touch it to the eye.

- Look in the mirror if you want. After a while, you don’t need to. 

- Put your contact lens on your pointer finger.  Make sure you have some lens solution on it so it sticks. EDIT: that extra drop helps it suck right on so it doesn’t fall out.  Also, a user stated I should reinforce that you make sure it is the right side out.  You should be able to read the little “ABC” or “123” on the lens from the outside, but I can usually tell because it looks weird.  

- Use your ring finger to pull your lower eyelid down.

- Touch the contact lens to the white area below your iris.  Give it half a second to stick.  

- Blink.  It will go where it is supposed to.  (EDIT: multiple people suggest just moving the eye around).

Let me know if you have other/better tips!

EDIT: to remove: slide to one side, then pinch.  /u/paulgasmm notes you’re unlikely to get contacts stuck in your eye unless you sleep in them.
