title:
LPT: when dropping off your car for service at a dealership, take a picture of your dashboard for your record

content:
Last week I took my car in at the Lexus dealership for a new OEM key. When they returned my car back, they noted that I had my check engine light on, which was not the case when I was dropping it off. 

When I asked them about it they said “well we documented that check engine light” at our shop and it’s gonna cost you $xx to fix it. When I mentioned that this wasn’t there when I dropped the car off, they asked if I had any pictures with time stamp. They refused to make it right. 

So now I know to take a picture of my dash before dropping off my car for service of any kind.
