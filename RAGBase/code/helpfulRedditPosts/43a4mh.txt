[Apple emit a gas that causes other fruits around them to ripen. The riper the apple, the more gas released. A single over-ripe apple can cause a chain reaction of over-ripening thus spoiling the whole bunch.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/31666/does-one-bad-apple-really-spoil-whole-bunch)

So pick out those bad apples from your bunches! Especially if you are cellaring them for the winter in your cold, snow covered home state.
