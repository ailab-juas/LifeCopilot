YSK that if you are paying student loans, the interest payments are tax deductible.

content:
Whoever you are paying to (or being garnished by) should be able to provide a 1098-d form/info that states total interest for that year.  This won't work if you use the 1040ez, but in my case the $2000ish got added to the $6300 standard deduction, saving me about $200. Almost a third of a paycheck!
