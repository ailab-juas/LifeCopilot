title:
YSK that if you hear low key conversations when the a/c is on, or the refrigerator, that you are not having a psychotic break. There is a phenomena where our brain sorts sounds into something "known", such as conversation, the sound of a gathering or such. It's normal. It is pareidolia.

content:
I recently saw a concern posted where someone was hearing voices in their air conditioning, and the voices would disappear when he turned it off. He thought perhaps it was his neighbors. But neighbors wouldn't turn their conversations on/off according to OPs a/c use.

Responses seemed to fall into two main categories: "You are having a psychotic break" and "check your carbon monoxide detector".  EDIT: Later comments bring up pareidolia.

Yes, both are a remote possibility. But the most likely, and most common, is something we all may have experienced at some point called pareidolia.

The article sums up the difference between pareidolia and psychosis this way:

"If you hear a symphony in Manhattan traffic, thank your auditory pareidolia for relieving your stress. But if you are convinced a toy doll is reciting a religious message, you probably have cause for concern."
