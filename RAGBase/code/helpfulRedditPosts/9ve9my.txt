title:
LPT: Right after someone finished a public presentation or speech, approach them and let them know they did a good job(no matter how well they actually did). There is no moment in which people are more vulnerable/ more insecure then when coming off stage. They will appreciate it more than anything.

content:
You may voice constructive criticism later. But tell them they did a good job right after they finished. Only criticise when adrinalin levels are back to normal.
