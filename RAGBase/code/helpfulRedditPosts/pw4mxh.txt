LPT: If you have a prepaid debit gift card with a low balance laying around, don’t let those few dollars passively go to credit corporation whose logo is on the card. Clear the balance by making a small online donation to a cause you believe in.

Today I found a few old prepaid debit gift cards floating around in one of my bags, each with less than a $10 balance. When the balance is that low, it can be hard to find shops that can process them but I sure hate the idea of letting those few extra dollars just passively go into a credit corporation’s profits. So I cleared them out by making a some small online donations to a cause I believe in. 

Whether it’s a gofundme for an artist or a family in need, or a political cause you care about, most fundraising campaigns allow you to customize an amount for your donation. So check the balance on the card, and set your donation accordingly to clear it out. 

A dollar here and a dollar there matters way more to small organizations and individuals than it  does to the mega corporations that are counting on you to let those couple bucks sit there till you forget that gift card ever existed.
