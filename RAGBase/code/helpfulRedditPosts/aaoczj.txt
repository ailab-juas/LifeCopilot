LPT: Learn to move on from disappointments without other people giving you "closure" when things end (jobs, friendships, etc.).

content:
Desiring "closure," (a feeling of satisfaction at the end, and a sort of perfect resolution) can keep you hung up on something a lot longer than is really good for a person. 

Jobs and friendships don't always last as long as one would want, and often end for reasons that are totally outside of one's control. "Closure" is really something you give to yourself, and it often takes time.

When someone asks someone else give them a detailed explanation of their reasoning for ending something, it's often about the person (the asker) wanting to know what they can do differently to keep the situation from ending. However, if the other person wanted the first one to change to keep the situation going, the other person likely would have discussed it with that person in that way (and likely already has, if change was an option). 

When things end without further explanation, that usually IS the explanation - there is nothing the other person can really learn or find useful other than the current set-up has come to an end.

Even when someone feels completely "blindsided" by a sudden end, often further reflection reveals what was happening all along.

EDIT: Some people here are mistaking what I am talking about as "ghosting." Ghosting is when someone just disappears and doesn't say "good-bye" (or "you don't work here anymore"). This is about when someone does say it, but you don't think that as enough information in the process as to why.  As a result, you feel can't move on because you just that extra bit of information, but that rarely is what is really the problem and you rarely get it even if it will be a magic cure.
