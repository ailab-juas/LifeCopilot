[38 Governors are up for reelection.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_gubernatorial_elections,_2014)  **Gerrymandering has no impact on gubernatorial elections.**

[33 Senators are up for reelection.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014)  **Gerrymandering has no impact on senatorial elections.**

[The ENTIRE House of Representatives are up for reelection.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2014)

[Ballot Initiatives](http://ballotpedia.org/2014_ballot_measures) out the proverbial wazoo.  **Gerrymandering has no impact on Ballot Initiatives.**

Plus an unknown number of judges, aldermen, councilmen, dog-catchers, school board members....  the list goes on.

If you're one of the [80%](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/congressional_job_approval-903.html) of people who disapprove of the job that Congress is doing, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4TH, 2014 is your opportunity to voice that disapproval.  If we don't vote, we can't change anything.

Where and how to register to vote:

 * [Rock The Vote](http://www.rockthevote.com) is a good place to find more information on registering to vote as well as your local polling place.

 * [Our Vote](http://www.ourvote.org) is a site that is supposed to help young voters learn about issues that directly concern them.  I have no idea how to navigate this site...

**/u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA submitted this mass of links!  Above and beyond Raptor.  Rawr.**

 * [Register to vote, via. US Election Assistance Commission](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/register_to_vote.aspx)  Mail-in voter registration forms in English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese.

Provides the wheres and whos of your state, plus contact information if you're still confused!
 * [Where to sign up for Selective Service (You can register to vote while you're in there!](http://www.todaysmilitary.com/contact-a-recruiter)  If you're a male, age 18 or older you need to sign up for Selective Service anyway; why not register to vote while you're at it?

Getting money out of politics ([and why it's important that we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kHACjrdEY)):

 * [Move to Amend](https://www.movetoamend.org/)  Widely considered to be one of the best chances to overturn Citizens United via constitutional amendment.  From their site: *"We, the People of the United States of America, reject the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United and other related cases, and move to amend our Constitution to firmly establish that money is not speech, and that human beings, not corporations, are persons entitled to constitutional rights.*"

 * [Represent.us](https://represent.us/) seeks to pass a law ending corruption in politics by way of "[The American Anti-Corruption Act](http://www.anticorruptionact.org/)" which would end lobbying, mandate transparency for PACs and SuperPACs as well as imposing spending limits on political action committees.  (**Thanks to /u/Battlingdragon for the URL correction**)
 
Tracking money in politics:

 * [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/) tracks political donations from PACs and Super-PACs.  From their site: *"OpenSecrets.org is your nonpartisan guide to money's influence on U.S. elections and public policy. Whether you're a voter, journalist, activist, student or interested citizen, use our free site to shine light on your government."*
 
Electoral reform:

 * [FairVote.org](http://www.fairvote.org) is working to fix gerrymandering in elections as well as many, many other necessary improvements.  From their site: *"FairVote educates and empowers Americans to remove the structural barriers to achieving a representative democracy that respects every vote and every voice in every election."*
 
Getting involved on the local level can have an even bigger impact and gives you the opportunity to pick just who goes on to the statewide, national elections, for local politics explore the following sites (**Thanks go to /u/LogicForDummies for finding these!**):

Maybe you're too young to vote, or otherwise disqualified from getting out and casting a ballot.  You can still persuade people to your position and change minds!  A good start is writing to your representative and writing letters to the editor.  Here are some resources:
