LPT: When you get a new kitten, spend time daily touching their paws.

content:
Getting them used to having their paws touched early will make it much easier to clip their claws through out their lives.


Edit: Wow, my first front page! Thanks. I go away for a couple hours and my inbox explodes.

Edit 2: Yes, yes, you should do this to your puppies too, and also you should apparently touch their teeth so you can brush them when needed.

Edit 3: I clipped my cats claws because she was indoor and elderly. She didn't move around much and couldn't take care of them herself. TIL many people don't clip their cats nails.
