YSK - Don't buy TurboTax, HR Block, etc. tax software from the company's websites. They are almost always significantly cheaper on third party sites, such as Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and Target.

Why YSK:

For example, TurboTax Premiere is listed for $90 on their official website, but it's only $54.99 on Amazon. Don't fall for those emails claiming $10 off and the 'guaranteed best price of the year.'

There are free options for basic returns, but not everyone qualifies for them so I wanted to point this out.

Edit 1: Wow! This really blew up. I really appreciate everyone's contributions. Personally, I've learned about many options to avoid paying for these programs. I've listed some of them below:

[FreeTaxUSA - Free Federal, $15 State (Deluxe Option Available)](https://www.freetaxusa.com/)

[IRS (I know. I know. It's scary to trust 'the man', but this is legit. Under 73k is free.](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile)
