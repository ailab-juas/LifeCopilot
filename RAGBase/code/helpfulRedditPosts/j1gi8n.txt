YSK that intrusive thoughts are normal, and don't mean you are a bad person.

content:
Why YSK: intrusive thoughts, while terrible, are very common. Having intrusive thoughts can be a source of shame and worry, as they often involve explicit violence and sexuality- but a thought is not an impulse. The effort we put in to fighting or distracting the unwanted thought is often what makes it stick or fuel it's return. 

Some ways to approach your relationship with unwanted thoughts are to label them as intrusive, remind yourself that they are automatic and not a reflection of your subconscious, and give yourself some time to let the intrusive thoughts to pass. 

While intrusive thoughts are not necessarily red flags, they may be a symptom of an underlying mental health condition. If they are causing enough distress to interfere with everyday life, seek the advice of a healthcare provider.
