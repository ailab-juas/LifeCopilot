YSK that anybody can dispose of up to 5 gallons of used motor oil for free at the auto center at Walmart and other select automotive shops

content:
I think just about any place that sells motor oil or does oil changes has a responsibility to recycle people's used oil, but I'm specifying walmart because I know for a fact that they do. 

Only Walmarts that have an auto center/garage where they do oil changes and tires will dispose of used oil.

When I worked in the auto center at a walmart we accepted more than the established limit. Every couple weeks a guy would come with multiple 5 gallon buckets that we would dump for him, but I'm not promising other stores will do the same.

If you don't live near a walmart that has an auto center, or live in a generally remote area then calling either the EPA's Oil Information Center hotline at  800-424-9346 or looking up and calling the EPA Customer Service line for your geographic region which can be found in the link below
