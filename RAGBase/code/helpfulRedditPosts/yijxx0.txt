YSK in California you can leave high school after 10th grade with the legal-equivalent of a high school diploma by taking the California High School Proficiency Exam

content:
Why YSK: The exam consists of a math and English portion, and is fairly easy (more than half of students pass it on the first try). If you pass you will be issued a certificate that is the legal-equivalent of a HS diploma, meaning you can go to college, apply for federal financial aid, or get any job that requires a diploma. This is much better than a GED.

It’s a fantastic option for students who don’t want to finish high school for any reason (too difficult, too boring, getting bullied, issues transferring credits, life circumstances, etc.)

I took this exam at the end of 10th grade, started community college the following year, transferred to a university two years later, and went on to get my PhD. It was one of the best decisions I ever made.
