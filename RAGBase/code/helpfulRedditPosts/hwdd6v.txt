YSK why Japan is allowing hybrid animal human fœtus

content:
Organs are hard to find.
If you need an organ transplant, you need a donor. And to have a donor, you need a fresh dead body with same blood type and same complex other factors. And this is hard to find, and people can wait month to get a transplant. This is where pigs come into play. Pigs and humans are not very différents, and we have the technology to create pigs with human organs. Let the pig mature, you have a fresh human organ ready to transplant. This is why Japan is allowing these kind of fœtus to be made, it's the first step for unlimited replacement organs. Not for catgirls or stuff.

Edit : I'm talking about full pigs with 1 human organ. Pig brain, pig body, pig everything except for a lung or a liver. Sorry if I was unclear
