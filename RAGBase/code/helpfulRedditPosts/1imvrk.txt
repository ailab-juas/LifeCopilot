LPT: Applying to a Federal Job on USAjobs? Use their resume maker and use words in the job description to describe your qualifications.

content:
1. The first cut in the hiring process is a computer filter where they take the top answers to the qualification questions, then they take the highest percent of keywords. Its a safe guess that those keywords will be ones they use to describe the qualifications

2. The resume builder on USA jobs is what they're used to looking at. There are no points for creativity (for most jobs) so give them what they want.
