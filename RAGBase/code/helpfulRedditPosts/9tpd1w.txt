YSK: If you can't open the login page for a public wifi, type 8.8.8.8 in the browser to force the login page to open

I struggled a lot with this when I try to get online an airport, at a coffee shop, or in a hotel / conference room. The correct wifi network is selected but the login never shows up. I found out recently that you can hit 8.8.8.8 in the browser and that'll force the login page to open.
