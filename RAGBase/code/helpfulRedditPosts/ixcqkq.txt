title:
YSK that Tuna is incredibly nutritious and packed with protein, healthy fats and vitamins — but it should not be consumed every day. Eating too much tuna could lead to unsafe consumption of mercury.

content:
Why YSK: There are multiple factors that would dictate the recommended weekly consumption of tuna, including tuna species, age, and personal body weight. But for most people, this means only 2-3 servings per week of tuna known to have the lowest levels (skipjack/canned light).

Edit: as some people have pointed out, tuna is not the only fish with mercury in it. I get that and didn’t mean to single out tuna exclusively. I posted as a YSK because some people eat crazy amounts of it. I mean, just read the comments here and you will see just how much some people are eating it.
