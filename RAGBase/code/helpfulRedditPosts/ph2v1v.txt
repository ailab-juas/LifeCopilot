LPT: When deciding on a new job, don't underestimate the importance of its distance from your house. Sometimes a bad job can be made worse by a long commute home and vice versa.

Wow what a response. And just to clarify...I'm not saying people don't consider their commute. I'm just saying too many people don't think about the effect it has on their day. Everyone is different and what works for you might not work for someone else. Thanks for all the love, and the hate, on this one.
