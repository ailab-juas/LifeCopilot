LPT: Think about your day in terms of "Energy management" in place of "Time management"

content:
Now I realize that my day is made of blocks where I will have high energy and low energy. Even when I have lots of time put aside or blocked off, it won't count for much if you have no energy. To me "energy management" is how I think of life now way more than "time management". I find you can get A LOT done in a short time, if your energies and concentration are high. 

Note; Not my original idea, I seen this in a Tik Tok snippet and it really has stuck with me.
