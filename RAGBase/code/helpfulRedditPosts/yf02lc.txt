YSK: hearing damage from prolonged exposure to loud noise is irreversible. There are earplugs you can use that allow you to hear music clearly at concerts that also protect hearing.

Why YSK: some people don't want to wear earplugs at concerts because they think they will muffle the music too much and ruin the experience. There are inexpensive earplugs that are designed to allow you to enjoy loud music while still protecting your ears.

Edit: for people asking for specific recommendations, I use a brand called Loop, which I really like. I initially tried ones made by Eargasm, which also have great reviews, but they just didn't fit my ears well.

Other brands recommended in the comments: Earasers, Hearos, Hearprotek, Surefire, ACS customs, Isotunes, Vibes.

I believe you can also have custom ones made by an audiologist if you want maximum fidelity/comfort/fit and are willing to spend the money.
