LPT: Being in a wheelchair doesn’t mean someone is a small child. Speak to physically-disabled adults like you would speak to any other adult.

content:
I have a new friend, A. A was born with a screwed-up spine and has to use a wheelchair to get most anywhere. People have been very kind to him in our church, but predictably, some people talk to him like he’s a 5-year-old. 

A is a full-grown 28-year-old man, and while is body may not function properly, his brain absolutely does. You can speak to him as an equal.
