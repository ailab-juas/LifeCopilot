title:
YSK the downsides of eating in front of the TV

content:
•If you often watch TV while snacking or eating your meal, you are more likely to overeat.  
This is because you are too distracted to notice you’re already full.

•You are often less satisfied by the food because you don’t focus on the taste and the eating process that much.

•You will develop a habit of eating in front of the TV. Every time you watch TV, you will feel the need of eating something and your appetite will increase although you might not even be hungry.

Why YSK: Many people turn on the TV while eating because they feel lonely or just don’t like sitting in silence. It’s okay to do so, but you should be aware of the possible downsides that could lead to overeating and gaining weight.

**Of course this doesn’t apply to everybody, all I’m talking about are tendencies.**

Edit: please stop telling me this doesn’t apply to you. I know it doesn’t apply to everyone. I wrote it in the post. Gonna make the font fat now so maybe more people read it.

Edit 2: No, this is not "a joke" as someone commented.
