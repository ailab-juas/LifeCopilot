YSK how to perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself, in case nobody is around when you start choking.

content:
Basically you want to find a chair or countertop that is about even with your belly button (or slightly below) then bend over and put all of your body weight onto it repeatedly until you stop choking.

Why YSK: at some point in time you may choke on food while eating a meal alone, and unless you have the presence of mind to run to a neighbors house (assuming they are even home) you should know how to do this for yourself. 

[Here is a video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ljL9JcK6RnM).


Edit: u/Kyle0ng made a comment below I thought was worth repeating: “There is also the ‘get on your hands and knees and immediately go to a mid-air plank’. It ain't pretty, but requires no chair.”
