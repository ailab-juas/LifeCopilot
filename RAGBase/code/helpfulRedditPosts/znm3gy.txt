YSK about an abrupt onset Neuropsychiatric condition in children know as PANDAS

PANDAS stand for: Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections. [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/pandas](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/pandas)

It presents as acute onset OCD and/or tics following a Strep A infection.  It can easily be mistaken for other neurological disorders like Tourette Syndrome or even mental illness.

**Children with PANDAS are at risk for being labeled as “behavioral” or “difficult”** when in fact they have no control over the way they are acting. They may appear anxious or moody.

Why YSK: There is currently a surge in Strep A infections:[https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rise-invasive-strep-a-infections-us-kids-rcna61507](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rise-invasive-strep-a-infections-us-kids-rcna61507) and many Strep A infections can go undetected. 

You may not have even known your child had a Strep infection, but they can still develop PANDAS.

Children who are misdiagnosed with a mood disorder risk having lifelong mental health and self-esteem issues.  YOU are the biggest advocate for your child.

**EDIT:** This [YouTube](https://youtu.be/n-g2NF6N8K8) episode of Mystery Diagnosis documents a 12 year old boy with pandas. 

It has home footage of his behaviors before his treatment.  

Video quality is crappy, but if you can stream the tv show Mystery Diagnosis it is season 9, episode 2
