LPT: Learn what to stockpile in case of plague, earthquake, blizzard, or other major events. You probably don't need to hit the freezer section of your local store.

 Just saw this on the facebooks - an interesting take on how to stockpile food and essentials. All I saw in my local Costco was people ransacking the frozen and perishable food sections, plus TP and paper towels. 

&gt;All joking aside, I grew up in a war zone so while everyone was panicking buying all the freezer stuff at walmart yesterday I was grabbing the supplies that worked for us during the war. Halfway down the canned food isle I was grabbing a few cans of tuna, corned beef, Vienna wieners, and spam a guy bumps me with his cart, he looked like he was new to the country so I thought Syrian or afghani, looks at my cart then looks at me and says in Arabic. Replenishing? I said yup. He then laughs and said with a wave of his hand they're doing it all wrong. I started laughing and he said I guess you experienced it too. I said yup. I told him I'm always prepared for disaster just in case. He laughed and said if it's not one thing it's another it can't hurt. To put it into perspective we had pretty much the same thing in our carts.  
&gt;  
&gt;While everyone was buying the frozen meats and produce we had oranges, bleach, canned food, white vinegar, crackers, rice, flour, beans (canned and dried), and little gas canisters for cooking.
