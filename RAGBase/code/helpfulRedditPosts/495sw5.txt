LPT: Sharpening your knives is way easier than people make it out to be, and it makes a huge difference.

content:
I got a set of nice knives for my wedding 5 and a half years ago, and I've never sharpened them. We chop a ton of vegetables, and toss our knives in the sink with the other dishes/throw them in the dishwasher. They got so dull it was like a butter knife.

Today, I got sick of it and looked up a video, and found a short one by Gordon Ramsay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBn1i9YqN1k . 

I tried it and it was incredibly easy. As soon as the knives were sharpened, I took a carrot and sliced it like it was butter. I took a head of lettuce and held it in one hand and slowly passed the knife through it and watched it fall apart in two pieces, then chopped up the root part over and over again with no effort. It was addicting. I'm going to cut everything tomorrow.

tl,dr; Sharpening knives is easy and awesome.
