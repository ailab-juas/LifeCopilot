LPT: A thumbs down ðŸ‘Ž on the highway is a better alternative to obscene gestures and helps to deescalate the situation on both sides.

content:
I wish I came up with this on my own. I watched someone do this on the highway a couple years back. Our guy was moving around a ****y and dangerous driver. He put his hand out the window gave a so so sign before locking in a fat thumbs down. It worked. The person pulled to the right lane and stopped being such an overt douche.
Iâ€™ve tried this, Iâ€™ve also flipped people off and received my fair share of gestures (not always the most focused driver). 
This has an interesting effect when doing it of not amping me higher (swearing obscene gestures etc do) and Iâ€™ve noticed that it doesnâ€™t escalate the recipient. Itâ€™s essentially an outlet for downvoting a driverâ€™s decision to drive 1 mph (1.6 kmh ;)) under the speed limit in the number 1 lane. A cordial if impersonal - you suck - before moving on.
