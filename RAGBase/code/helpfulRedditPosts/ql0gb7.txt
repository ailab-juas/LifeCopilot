LPT: Stop apologizing about everything. I used to apologize and say sorry so much. I realized it made me look weak. People respect me more now that I don't apologize about every mishap.

content:
 I'm NOT saying "don't ever apologize " . If you have genuinely wronged someone absolutely you should apologize. What I'm referring to is anyone who was like I use to be...

 I was abused alot growing up and every move I made I was chastised. I took this mentality into adulthood. Feeling like every toe I stepped out of place I needed to abruptly apologize. 

 By working on identifying , and to an extent understanding,  the appropriate times to say sorry and when to just explain the situation. 
 I have gained alot more respect in day to day conversations.
