YSK: Netflix is raising prices again

content:
The basic plan for $7.99 will remain the same; However the standard plan with HD for $9.99 will increase by a dollar and the premium plan with Ultra HD for $11.99 will increase by two. The sad part is that even long time subscribers will have to pay the new premium with no grace period like before. I believe the new rates begin October 19th.
