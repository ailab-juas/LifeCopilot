YSK that Equifax will stop offering free removal of credit freezes on June 30th, 2018

content:
If you would like to save yourself the fee and will need to use your credit in the near future, you will need to un\-freeze before this deadline. Below are the details for all three companies:  


Equifax: \(800\) 685\-1111 

TransUnion:  \(888\) 909\-8872 

Experian: [https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html)  


Note: Experian didn't allow me to do this over the phone, and equifax has a rather finicky automated phoneline operator.
