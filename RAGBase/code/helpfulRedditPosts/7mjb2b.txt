LPT: Laser printer tells you it's out of ink? Put in a new toner, print a page, put old toner back in, print 500 more pages

content:
This is for laser printers that won't let you print because they're supposedly out of ~~ink~~ toner. My Brother printer tells me this and pages are still coming out perfect quality. If you put in a new toner, print a page, and then put the old toner back in it thinks it has a new toner and lets you print all you want. You can easily squeeze out an extra 500 pages or so.

EDIT: Copying /u/g2g079 comment here for visibility:

This works ...sometimes. Other methods that may or may not work depending on your printer.

* Override warnings
* Tape over a sensor
* Reset chip
* Replace chip
* Rotate with 3 other cartridges
* Hard reset printer (the harder the better)

I personally use the override option. Then run until it's out and the colors start bothering me.


EDIT 2: Apparently shaking the toner cartridge worked for some people too.
