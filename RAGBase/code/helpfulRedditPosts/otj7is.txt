YSK: “Free Guest Passes” at Gyms Almost Always Have Annoying Strings Attached

content:
Source: I have worked at multiple gyms over a period of about 4 years and have also been going to various gyms my whole life. 

“Free guest pass” is more often than not a way for the gym to collect leads , then bother the ever-loving F out of you trying to get you to sign up/buy personal training/ etc. You will most likely be required to go on a tour and hear a sales pitch before you can even try out the gym. 

Also, once your free trial is over, expect them to continue reaching out to you. Forever. 

Why YSK: You can avoid a major headache by not using these, or at the very least you’ll know what’s coming. IMO, you’re better off paying whatever their one-day fee is, and trying it out that way before signing up, or using a friend’s guest privileges (different than “guest pass”).
