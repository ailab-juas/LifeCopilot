LPT: In order to help teach kids how to clean in more detail rather than just ‘straightening up’ clutter, hide money in obscure places.

content:

My daughter (almost 11) wanted a way to earn money, so I gave her some cleaning chores to earn an allowance. Once she completed each job, I would give her payment. However... “clean” to her is different than it is to me. So I started hiding her payments (in change) in more difficult to find areas, some wrapped with a piece of paper containing a description of how that area should be cleaned. It became a game to her and now every time I ask her to clean her room, she gets excited and details the whole thing for maximum allowance... up to $5 for her room. After each time she says she is done, I walk through with her and take any change she didn’t find... these days I’m lucky to find a single quarter she left behind. And her room (and my car now) looks fantastic.
