LPT: after age 25, keep a box of wedding, baby, and sympathy cards with stamps on hand at all times.

content:
I'm 33 and in the last 18 months I have had 17 friends give birth, 6 get married and 5 lose a parent. 

Edit : Apparently I broke a sacred reddit rule by having friends.

Thanks to nice folk even if you didn't agree.

Edit 2: I do not live near the majority of my friends and cannot usually attend services. 

Edit 3: Cards make people angry. Who knew?
