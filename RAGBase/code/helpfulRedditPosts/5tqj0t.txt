LPT: Your hearing is not invincible. Please lower your volume when listening to music. Bring earplugs to concerts. Do not make the same mistake I made.

content:
Your hair cells are fragile. Protect them. I made the mistake of listening to music and pretty much anything at unsafe levels. Now, I pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.

This will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake I made. 

Here is a [link to relative noise volumes](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm). Also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this. 

For those who don't know what [tinnitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAjJogJ0cs) is. There are many forms of tinnitus. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qOMgLa_o) is but one of them. 

EDIT: I'm glad this is reaching many people. If you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. I often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. If you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. If you google "tinnitus definition" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. 

"[The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million Americans — experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)" 

Stay safe everyone. 

EDIT 2: Hello everyone, I've been seeing a lot of post here. Thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. Just a few things to keep in mind. Not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. Tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have TMJ. In these cases they may or may not be permanent (I don't want to scare you), and I would highly recommend going to your ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor) as soon as possible. Also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. This is important to remember. See your ENT to get these ruled out! 

As /u/OhCleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. This is how you cause earwax blockage. 

Edit3: I've been reading all of your comments. Here I will include some notable suggestions I've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . 

2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. 

3) **there are earplugs called ~~"Etymotic"~~(just search for "earplugs that don't muffle sound") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. 

/u/ukralibre said "Thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed." However, by then it'll be too late. Take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this LPT. 

Edit 4: I put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. It can lead to hyperacusis. You want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. 

Edit 5: For many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. Have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? Or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just "disappears". Same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.

Our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as [brain plasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDlLD97CLM). Your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. I know how ludicrous this sound, but I have I personally have habituated to the sound myself, and I'm pretty much back to my normal life. Things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your T. For now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). As always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless.
