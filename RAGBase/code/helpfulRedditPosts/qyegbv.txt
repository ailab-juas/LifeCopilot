YSK: Job Recruiters ALWAYS know the salary/compensation range for the job they are recruiting for. If they aren’t upfront with the information, they are trying to underpay you.

Why YSK:  I worked several years in IT for a recruiting firm. All of the pay ranges for positions are established with a client before any jobs are filled. Some contracts provide commissions if the recruiters can fill the positions under the pay ranges established for each position, which incentivizes them to low-ball potential hires. Whenever you deal with a recruiter, your first question should be about the pay. If they claim they don’t have it, or are not forthcoming, walk away.
