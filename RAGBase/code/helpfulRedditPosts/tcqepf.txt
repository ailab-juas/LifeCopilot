LPT: there are no dream jobs, there’s only a job you might like for a few months/years and when you’re done with it just change your job position if you can. you don’t need to stay forever in a boring job

content:
Some of you might have a dream job but you’re probably few, we’ve been conditioned to think we have some kind of destiny jobs/dream job but that’s not true. 

You may like your job but if you weren’t forced to do it for the money and to survive maybe you’d do something else, you’d maybe explore the world, do something you really like not worrying about whether or not you’ll eat this week or have enough money to pursue your hobbies or maybe you are lucky enough to have a job about your hobby. 

Just know that over the years your hobbies might change and your dream job may not be a dream job after a while. If that’s the case, simply switch if you can, do something you like because life isn’t about work, it’s about doing the things you like. 

Also: You’re not obligated to love your work, I mean I used to work in places I didn’t really like but had to, now I do something very exciting but I’m sure someday I’ll want to do something else and that’s fine, it doesn’t mean my current job is bad but people change and jobs should change according to what you like, not the opposite imo. Of course that’s if you can change, I know I couldn’t for quite some time before of financial restrictions. 

Be happy people, enjoy your stay on earth
