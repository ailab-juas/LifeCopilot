YSK that different people have different tolerance levels of suffering/enduring hardships and comparing different situations is not always helpful.

While it can be good to remind oneself that "others may have it worse" to help put things into perspective when going through a hard time, it's never good to put down someone else's suffering because you've had it worse.

Edit1: thanks for the awards kind people!

Edit2: lots of people have made the very good point that this applies to how we respond to our own suffering internally too. Yes, it's unhelpful to  downplay someone else's hardship because you've had it worse. But we often do that to ourselves by not allowing ourselves to acknowledge hardship due to guilt stemming from the fact that other may have it worse. It's important to find the balance between not making our hardship out to be more than it is, which can be unhelpful to ourselves and result in being unnecessarily overwhelmed or getting ourselves into a tizz, and not making ourselves feel guilty for having a hard time because it's not that bad compared to others. Obviously there has to be a line somewhere and some "hardship" could be said to be objectively minor, but I strongly believe that being aware of the above mentioned concept can be helpful.
