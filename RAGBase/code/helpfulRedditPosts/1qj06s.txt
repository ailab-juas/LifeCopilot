LPT: If you're eating in a restaurant past closing time, clear your bill so the waiter doesn't have to wait on you to close cash.

content:
It's just a small polite thing you can do to make the jobs of waiters easier, since they won't have to wait around for you to finish and then stay behind even later to close cash. Every time I've offered, they've really appreciated it, since it means they can go home just a little sooner. 

**Edit**: Wow, I wasn't expecting this to be quite as big as it did. In response to what a ll of you are thinking, yes, it's an asshole thing to do, but as I said to someone else, 'Sometimes shit happens. It takes longer than you thought to get there, or the closing time is earlier than you thought, or everywhere else is closed and your starving and gotta eat something.

Admittedly, that usually isn't the case, but it's usually better all around if both parties try to be accommodating to each other'

At the end of the day, as much as it sucks, people will still do it. If it just so happens you're that person for whatever reason, make it easier on the staff. Let them know when you're done ordering food, pay for your food early, eat fast, and tip well.

**And for those of you asking, clear your bill does mean to pay it in full.** Sorry about any confusion on that!

**Double Edit:** And yes, I know it's not very LifeProTippy, but I don't think /r/LifePoliteTips exist so this was the best I could come up with.
