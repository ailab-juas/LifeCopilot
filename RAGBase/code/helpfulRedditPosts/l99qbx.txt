YSK if you decide to visit family/friends that are going through a rough time, consider bringing your own food and arrange your trasportation, even small inconveniences can add stress in difficult times

Why YSK: during rough times even small extra tasks/errands can create stress

Me and my GF are going through a real hard time, own little baby is in hospital. Our family came to visit from out of town for a day (much appreciated moral support obviously) but we had to pick them up from the airport and we had to buy groceries for a proper meal (nothing fancy but still something that requires more effort than frozen pizza).   
Again, is not about the effort in itself (we live in a relatively small town) but mentally we could do without those little extra tasks.

EDIT: thanks for the awards but most of all for the good wishes for my little boy, he’s in ICU and slowly improving.

Just wanted to clarify a point: I know that I could tell my family “get a taxi  please” they are lovely people and I’m glad when they show up for support. 
I just think if you’re visiting someone that is in a bad place, think about going that extra mile. Don’t assume “they would tell me if it’s not ok”, can you spare them any inconvenience? do that (even if they’ve done it dozens of times before) 
Is there a spare room you can usually sleep in? ask them if it’s ok or if you should get a room, etc...
