LPT: If you're visiting haunted houses this season, do not touch anything (including actors) unless you are told it's ok.

content:
I work as a scare actor and we have a dummy tied up in the middle of the room I work in. I've seen a disturbing amount of people in the past few weeks ask "is she real??" And then immediately try to grope/finger it without getting an answer.

If you are that person, you aren't funny. You're a hassle and a liability for your whole group to get thrown out. 

Last night I also had a guy "tickle" me when my back was turned and I almost punched him.

DO NOT TOUCH SCARE ACTORS OR PROPS.

We want you to have fun and be scared, but do not interact physically unless you are given permission.
