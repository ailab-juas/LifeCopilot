LPT: If you bring a complaint to a supervisor/management about the workplace, offer ideas for improvements. You'll be seen as a contributor and not just a critic.

content:
Some people are saying this is a ridiculous tip, and that they would get fired for trying to improve their workplace. I can only imagine people are talking about shit retail jobs that few people take seriously as a career.

If you work somewhere where the management doesn't respect the employees or the environment, then of course this tip won't work. Nothing will.
So, how about, LPT: Don't work for fuckwits.
