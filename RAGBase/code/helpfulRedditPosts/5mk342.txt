LPT: Use "C.A.R" or "S.T.A.R" in Job applications &amp; Interviews

[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/5m9zwd/i_got_a_job_interview/) inspired me to post this tip...

[Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4f5wo/):

[CAR](https://www.bluesteps.com/blog/car-interview-technique-key-to-landing-executive-job.aspx)

Car is Context, Action, Result 

[STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result)

Star is Situation, Task, Action, Result.

When applying for jobs, you **need** to give examples if you can; it's alright saying "I would do ..." but it's much better to say "I did ...".

Using this technique, I went from never hearing back from job applications to being inundated with replies and offers...Albeit "starter jobs" but you've got to start somewhere...

I'm not saying this is a magical one-stop-solution, but it may help.

Question: "How would you deal with conflict resolution?"

Answer:

Context: "Working as a front desk receptionist, I recall a time where a customer came in really aggressive and angry because his money was stopped"

Action: "I looked into the situation, and found that he needed to provide xyz, and explained how to do so"

Result: "customer left happy, came back with the documents and was happy knowing his payment would be resumed". 

This works just as well in applications, as the interview itself.

Wow this really blew up ...

I'm glad this has helped a few, and even got some the job...[At google no less!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4iwk8/?context=3)

I have been silently reading your comments, and there are loads of variants to these acronyms/phonemes(?) Whilst it [may not suit all](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews/dc4isb2/?context=3) it's quite interesting to see how vast it can mean in other applications.
