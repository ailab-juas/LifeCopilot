LPT: Don't rely on WiFi if Ethernet is an option.

content:
To put it simply WiFi sucks. Its convenient sure, but its rarely the fastest or most reliable option. 

Even the newest and fastest WiFi cards/adaptors are slower than Ethernet, and rarely do they give you the speed they claim. For example I recently was asked to sort out a friends 'slow' internet. He had 200Mb service, but could only get 70, even with a 450Mb, 5GHz WiFi card and a nice strong signal. I could also only get the same on my phone, even when 2ft from the Router.

The solution was a Gigabit capable powerline connector, which sends the signal over your homes power circuits. These resulted in 213Mb as reported by speedtest.net.


EDIT: Yes there are options like a better router, but they cost a lot more than powerline connectors and often look like modern art sculptures. Many people also cant set up a new router, or their ISP wont let them use another one.
If your PC is close enough to use a direct Ethernet cable then that's even better, in this case it resulted in 225Mb.

TL;DR WiFi sucks, use a cable.
