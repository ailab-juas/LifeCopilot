YSK, a lot of craft beers have the date of when it was canned on the bottom of the can. So check for the freshest ones because some may be months old but newer, fresher ones are usually just behind.

I get that stores will face up the old stock to get rid of it, but that doesnâ€™t mean you should have to sacrifice fresh beer because the store has left over old stock.
