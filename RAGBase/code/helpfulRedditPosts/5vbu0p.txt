YSK: there's a Google Chrome extension called 'StayFocusd', which lets you block specific sites at specific times of day in order to increase your productivity. [Technology]

You can find it on 

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en

And you can choose which days and which hours you want to stay 'focused', and which sites you want to block/allow. Obviously, and unfortunately, i NEEDED to block this site :D
