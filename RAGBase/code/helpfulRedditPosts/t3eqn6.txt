LPT: Try to expose yourself to more heat and light if it's difficult for you to get out of bed in the morning

Basically doing the reverse of sleep hygiene will help you up. Relying on multiple alarm clocks spread 1 minute apart is more about deterring the risk of oversleeping. The real life tip is to get 7-9 hours but sometimes it’s just not attainable. 

Try getting out of bed when it’s 60 degrees F in the room versus 75 degrees F. Add light by opening the blinds or turning on the lights or TV. If you tend to use your phone first thing, turn up the brightness. There’s no value for me to preach caffeine and stimulants, everyone knows those tricks. 

If you’re lucky enough to afford, try buying a thermostat that runs on a schedule or has phone app features. I haven’t found automated blinds within a reasonable, home budget but there’s always hope.
