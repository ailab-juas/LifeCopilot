LPT: Take a picture of your kids at the entrance to the amusement park.

content:
Any time you take your kids someplace with large crowds like amusement parks, the beach, ski resorts, etc, always take a picture of them and what they are wearing that day.  Should they get lost, it will be much easier to show people a picture then try to describe their outfits, etc.   Especially since you will likely be upset and not thinking clearly.  It also will make it extremely easy to share their pictures electronically and save precious time.
