YSK that the Pew research center offers a quiz that will tell you, based on your own beliefs, what political ideology you most closely align with.

The site for this quiz is [here ](http://www.people-press.org/quiz/political-typology)

Edit: as many people pointed out, opinions on some issues aren't always so black and white, u/1radgirl posted this [link](http://www.politicalcompass.org/test) which is a similar test with a broader spectrum. 

Edit^dos: u/MBowling5494 and several others have pointed to (Isidewith)[www.isidewith.com] that will pair you up with a candidate in your area that espouses your beliefs
