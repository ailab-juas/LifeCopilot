title:
YSK: This whole week in New York is a "code blue" weather emergency. This means that if you see a homeless person on the street seeking shelter, you can call 311, give a description of the person and the location, and an outreach team will be dispatched to assist.

content:
You don't need to approach the person, or wait for anyone to arrive. All you need to do is call 311.

Edit - /u/Captain_A says that [This is also applicable in DC as well. You can call 311 or 202-399-7093.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/7op39u/ysk_this_whole_week_in_new_york_is_a_code_blue/dsb9x89/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=YouShouldKnow)
