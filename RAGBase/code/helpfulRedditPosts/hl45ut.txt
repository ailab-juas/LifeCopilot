YSK that not all illnesses are visible, and you shouldn't assume someone is healthy based on their appearance

content:
I have Cystic Fibrosis, and look relatively healthy on the outside. I have a badge to park in disabled parking spaces. I can walk absolutely fine, but I have a lung capacity of less than 40% and chronic lung infections, so I get tired very easily, and it takes more energy for me to do simple tasks. The amount of dirty looks I've received for getting out of the car and then walking around is ridiculous. 

Not every sick person *looks* sick, and it isn't your place to try to analyse their condition. This goes for seemingly healthy people parking in disabled spots, using the disabled bathroom, getting up out of a wheelchair, etc. 

Telling us we 'look fine' is also quite offensive, even if you mean it as a compliment, and can feel like invalidation. 

Please leave people alone and don't question their medical conditions based on appearances.
