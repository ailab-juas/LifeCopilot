LPT: If you are struggling to keep your room clean and tidy because of fatigue, depression or any other reasons, bring 2 items out with you whenever you leave the room. It's much easier than spending 1 hour cleaning everything once in a while.

Do you like to eat in your room watching tv or being on the computer and you have a pile of cups and plates on the table? Bring a cup and a plate out to the kitchen whenever you go out the room to pee or wtv.
Do you often go to bed quickly and drop your clothes on the ground next to the bed and you now have a pile up of clothes? Bring a handful to the washing machine on your way out the room.

I always hated having to clean my room when it was really messy and dirty because it seemed too hard or too long. Now that I started doing that, my room is always pretty much empty of clothes or plates and whenever I actually need to clean it, it's much faster and easier and takes less than 30 minutes. The task seems easier and faster to do so I'm more eager to do it right away.
