LPT: How to distract your mind in bed and fall asleep faster.

content:
Tl;dr: Think about an object/subject/person and quickly think about something related to it. Then think about something related to that. Keep doing this.

So, for example, I think about a girl I know. She has golden blond hair. Gold is yellowy. Bananas are yellow. I hate slipping on those bananas in Mario Kart. Tetris is also a game. Grand Theft Auto. GTA also stands for Greater Toronto Area. Toronto’s mayor. Fat like a pig. Pork rinds. Orange rinds. The orange room in the apartment I lived in as a toddler. My little brother sleeping in the crib in said room. Crib. Yo dawg. Randy Jackson. Janet Jackson. Nipples...

When I close my eyes and hunt for related things, my eyes naturally want to bolt around like I’m in REM sleep. I just let them go. I also get distracted and start thinking about life problems and stuff at the same time, but as long as I’m keeping that hunt going on in the back of my mind and my eyes are bolting around, it doesn’t matter too much. One thing you can do to break up distractions is to think about things related to the distractions and go from there. Also, if you think up something randomly that's unrelated just go with it. You're trying to disrupt your natural worries, not stay focused on one thing for too long, and get lost in a sea of nonsense.
