LPT If you have a loved one in a Skilled Nursing Facility and want to ensure they’re care for: Visit them

content:
I’ve worked in skilled nursing facilities for years and it is a fact that our residents who are visited often are better taken care of.

When family visits often, that forces the CNAs (the ones doing the brunt of the work) to make sure your loved one is clean just in case you visit. We’re talking a good bed bath, face washed , oral hygiene, fingernails cleaned, brief changes regularly and getting them out of bed regularly.

The ones that aren’t cognitively intact and don’t receive visitors? There’s a good chance they will lay in their own excrement for hours, they’ll have feces and dirt under their fingernails and won’t leave their bed for days (if not weeks) at a time.

Visit your loved ones if they can’t advocate for themselves. There’s a lot of us who try our best at these facilities but there is always 1-2 terrible people who don’t want to do their job.

Edit: I just wanted to add that there are SO MANY qualified, hard working and compassionate CNAs, nurses, nurse practitioners, therapy staff, kitchen staff, house keepers, maintenance workers, social workers, activity staff and MANY others that dedicate their lives to caring for your loved ones.

These facilities aren’t perfect, but most individuals do try so hard to provide your person with love and care.
