LPT: college students, check RateMyProfessor before tests and read what other students say about the most efficient ways to study for the exams are specific to that professor's course.

content:
I often check before the semester begins to see the ratings and briefly read the reviews, but when the semester starts and I am already enrolled, I rarely check it again. Until I realized that it had very useable study suggestions specific to that exact teacher (ex. study powerpoint slides, go over handouts, do the practice problems etc.)
