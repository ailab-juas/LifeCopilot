LPT: Single guys living alone: get an “emergency female comfort station” (tampons, pads, other feminine products and soaps). You may not need it but if you have female guests (family, friends, romantic partners) they will GREATLY appreciate it.

content:
More general items to keep available for guests as well:
1) hair ties
2) trash can (I’m shocked this isn’t automatic)
3) tooth brushes
4) bandaids

ITT: People that think I’m a:
1) Creep
2) Simp
3) Player
4) Weirdo

And you don’t fucking tell them that you have one like it’s a goddamn selling point you Neanderthals. They check under the sink like a normal person...
