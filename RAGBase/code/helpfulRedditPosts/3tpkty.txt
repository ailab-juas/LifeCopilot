YSK: HIV can show no physical symptoms for years and still be present... the best time to get an HIV test is the moment you think you've been exposed to it

Nurse here. You'd be surprised how many people unfortunately don't realize they're a carrier of HIV simply because they "don't feel sick". A big reason this virus spreads is because people have no idea they're carriers, even if they know they've had sex with someone who is HIV positive before.

If you think there's a chance you've been exposed to HIV, please, go get blood work done. The stigma of having the test is no longer an issue and there is a strong argument that anybody who has had unprotected sex should be tested, as the number of positive heterosexuals is now higher (in the UK) than homosexuals.

edit: "You should get tested immediately but a negative test shorty after exposure doesn't mean you aren't HIV positive. You should get tester 3-6 months after that too." thanks /u/girlindie
