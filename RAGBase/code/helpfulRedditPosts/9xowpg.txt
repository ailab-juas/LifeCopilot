YSK that if you take illicit drugs you should get a fentanyl test kit. They are cheap (sometime free) and could save your life.

content:
Lots of illicit drugs today are being cut with Fentanyl to increase potency and make manufacturing cheaper. But the substance is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.

This has caused many deaths the past few years, even to people very experienced with drugs and their personal limits. A person can unknowingly overdose on Fentanyl after taking their standard dose of another substance.


It was recently the anniversary of the death of artist Lil Peep, who died to this. And more recently Mac Miller. And there have been countless other people affected by this, my heart goes out to the people who have lost a loved one to drugs.


I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, but if you want to take illicit substances, please get a fentanyl test kit.
