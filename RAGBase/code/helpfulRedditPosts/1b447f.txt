LPT: Look yourself in the eyes when you look in a mirror

content:
You may not even realize it, but ~~most~~ many* people won't make eye contact with themselves.  Especially if you have confidence issues or social awkwardness, it's harder to get over if you can't even look yourself in the eye.  It took me about a month to stop automatically averting my gaze, and the improvement is remarkable.


*Edit: I want to address some of the major criticisms this has received.

1:  It doesn't have to apply to you to be a Life Pro Tip.

&gt;An LPT is a tip that improves your life in a meaningful way.

Confidence and positive self image are pretty meaningful to those of us who lack them.

2:  People don't seem to understand the purpose of this.  It isn't "look at your eyes in the mirror and tell yourself how pretty you are".  It's, "Hey, have you noticed if you don't make eye contact with yourself?  Start!"  I never claimed everyone with self esteem issues could use this, nor that only they could.

3:  Given the "I wish more people would understand mental illness" thread the other day, I'm appalled at how many people here are being outright insulting to people they know nothing about, nor understand to any capacity.  Mocking people for not being able to look their self in the eye is childish and ignorant, regardless of their mental status.
