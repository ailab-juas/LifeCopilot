title:
YSK Take a Picture of Your Kids

content:
Why YSK: When you go to an entertainment park such as Disney or 6 Flags, take a quick picture of your kids. If you become separated for any reason, you can provide security a picture of what your child looks like and what they were wearing at the time. This can make it much faster to locate them.

EDIT: to include taking a photo of the child from head to toe so you get the shoes in as well. Thanks for all the great suggestions!
