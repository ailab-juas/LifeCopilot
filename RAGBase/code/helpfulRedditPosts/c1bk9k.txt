I see on the news all the time of cops doing routine stop and almost getting hit by other drivers so I thought I'd share some advice to hopefully help you alert other drivers to be alert.

If you have the time you can check the rest of the article it details pretty much all the most common motorcycle hand signals. These hand signals don't need to be a secret if you don't ride knowing them could one day help you save their life yours or another's on the road
