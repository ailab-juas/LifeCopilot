YSK these things before/after buying a new home

content:
• Always change the locks and garage door code after buying a new home. Realtors and prior owners will still likely have keys and you never know if someone may use them to gain access later.

• Never buy a house without having an inspection done by licensed inspector of your choosing. Don't go with the owners word or the contractor these people will work hard to hid issues and get you to focus on the good not mentioning problems. 
Inspectors will be able to assess everything from plumbing, electrical and structural and will literally save you 10s of thousands of dollars if they find major issues which allow you to walk away from a potential sale.

• Talk to the neighbors and ask if they know anything about the house you are looking at. They will likely be able to tell you if there are major issues with the place and the people that lived there. This also allows you to gauge the people and neighborhood environment see if they will be acceptable to live near.

• Try your hardest to be cordial with your immediate neighbors because they are far more willing to help if they like and know you vs. someone who has only said a few words ever. You don't have to be friends but being and having good neighbors will make your life massively easier.

• Learn basic maintenance skills like plumbing faucets and toilets. Learn to do drywall patching and basic carpentry. This will save you thousands of dollars over time. 

• If you have a yard keep it maintained. It doesn't have to be immaculate or beautiful but you should lay down weed treatments and keep it mowed. Nice property brings nicer prices to everyone in the area and allows for quicker sales. 

• When buying never go with an adjustable rate mortgage or ARM loan for short. They may look enticing but those rates will quickly rise and you will be stuck with payments that continue to increase. Much of the ARM loans were neutered after the great housing collapse but they seem to be starting up again. Always get fixed rate.

• In regards to the true value of home just look at the county assessors office and they well have the tax values for the homes in your area. By getting the tax values and looking up prior sales for the area you will be able get a good reading on what prices should be and see if the seller is adding too much.
