LPT: if you have a one-off need to drive a large/heavy truck for a long distance, get a free 1-week trial of an RV navigation app to avoid low overpasses and low-weight bridges.

I just had to drive a 12' 7", 26-foot, 26000-lb box truck 800 miles into Chicago. Visions of the 11foot8[11foot8](http://11foot8.com/) bridge were dancing in my head, and neither Waze nor Google Maps allows you to add height restrictions to your route.

I ran across the suggestion to use an RV navigation app. I downloaded one and found an RV in their database that was heavier than the truck and only 1" shorter. The app got me there with no problems.

Don't forget to cancel the nav subscription before the end of the free week to avoid being charged.
