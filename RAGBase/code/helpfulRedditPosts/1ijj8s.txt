LPT: Driving alone somewhere at least 30 min away? Listen to a TED talk! Time will fly and you will learn LPTs at the same time!

content:
Im addicted to TED talks. They're like LPTs on crack. I know they've been around, but I just recently started listening on a couple 90 minute drives. They honestly felt like 15 minute drives, thanks to TED talks being so engaging. Time flies when you're learning cool, new ideas!
