LPT: When it comes to your car NEVER trust a lube shop or dealership when someone approaches you with a dirty air filter and says "You really need to replace this air filter." More than likely the air filter isn't even out of your car.

My wife went to get her oil changed at the full service car wash we go to and the mechanic came to her with a filter that looked horrible. Her Tahoe is only a 1 year old and she knows how I am all about taking care of the vehicles. She told him to change it.

When I get home from work she was telling me how she got the oil changed at almost exactly the 5000 mile mark. Good Job babe I was going to do that Saturday for you. Then she says They replaced the air filter too because it looked like hell. Babe I replaced your air filter and mine in late August.

No way it was her filter they were showing her. I've seen them do this to other people before and really never paid much attention because I figured maybe they did need a new filter. But I replaced her's less than a month ago and I have only had to fill her vehicle up twice since then so less than a 1000 miles.

So just go to walmart or an autoparts store and it's a very easy procedure. Plus you will save money.
