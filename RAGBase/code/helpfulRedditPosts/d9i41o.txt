YSK: School's value doesn't come from the information you learn, but the underlying skills it teaches.

content:
School does teach you some applicable information in the classes you take. Maybe you won't apply what you learn about the war of 1812, but I've actually applied calculus knowledge to everyday tasks more than once. 

That being said... In my opinion, it isn't the stuff you learn in the individual classes that is valuable, it's the life skills that the entirety of school teaches you. 

You learn social skills. How to not only interact with people on the same level as you (friends) but also people that are in positions of power (teachers/faculty). This gives you a start to integrating into a workplace environment where you'll have colleagues and bosses. 

It teaches you time management. Learning how to balance homework and projects is no different than meeting deadlines at work. And quality matters too.  

It teaches you applicable knowledge in terms of computer skills. Learning how to use Outlook beyond just sending emails (tasks, calendars, etc), using excel beyond just keeping lists, using power point beyond just creating a happy birthday print out,... All of this will make you look like a god amongst your peers. (Vlookups in excel are like voodoo to the people I work with)  

Overall, school teaches you how to function in society. You may not realize it if you're in your teen years, in class while you read this, but I promise you what you're learning in school today will help you in life for the long haul. 

Jim that you play basketball with every day during lunch? You don't know it know it now, but you'll never speak to him again after graduation. Cherish this experience and make the most of it. As you get older you're going to miss it.
