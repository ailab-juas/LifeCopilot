YSK: You can completely avoid exorbitant US tuition fees by going to Europe for your BS or MS.

Clarification / caveat: For people who can't get a private loan or parental help or have their own $ saved up, this probably won't help you since AFAIK there are no financial assistance programs to attend school abroad. 

Caveat 2: for premed or other professional type degrees: check med schools (or potential employers) to see if foreign degrees transfer. Do your due diligence as with anything in life.

Why pay 8-20k tuition when you can pay ~1k in Europe, plus have way more fun since you're in Europe? There are lots of English-taught programs throughout the EU that are extremely cheap. 

Do employers recognize it? Yes, if anything it looks more worldly, interesting, exciting, ambitious, and shows confidence that you went to Europe for your studies. 

Plus you will have insane amounts of fun, once you're there you can take super cheap flights to other parts of Europe. Use just 3k of the 50k+ you're saving to go explore. I did my master's there and so fucking badly wish I could go back in time and do my undergrad there too.
