LPT: Working from home on your own PC? Create a work user account.

content:
Since I work from home and I'm often distracted I created a separate user account on my PC that has a bland wallpaper and no video game shortcuts. My browser logs me in as my work-related google account. 
All of my docked program shortcuts are related to my work.
When work is over, I switch users and return to my personal account.

It's almost like working on two different machines.
