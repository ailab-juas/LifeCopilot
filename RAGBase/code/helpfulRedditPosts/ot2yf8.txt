title:
YSK that dump trucks are still liable for damage caused by debris falling from their truck, whether they have a “Stay Back” or “Not Responsible” sign/sticker or not.

Why YSK: Trucking companies will put signs/stickers on their trucks saying “Stay Back 300 Feet” (the distance varies) or “Company Not Responsible For Damage” as a way to prevent people from making insurance claims against them for chipped/cracked windshields, headlights, paint damage, etc. However, they actually *are* liable, because they’re required to properly secure their load, no matter what it is. So if a clump of dirt, for example, falls off of the bed sides or the truck hits a bump and a rock comes out of the bed, and it hits your car, they are liable for the repairs to your car. 

Advice I was given by a LEO was to get the information from the truck and report it to my insurance, and let them fight the trucking company. The information you’d need includes the company name, truck license plate number or truck number (companies with multiple trucks will generally put a number somewhere on the side of the hood, or a rear corner of the cab; it’s usually a two or three digit number), what road you were on and where on that road it happened, direction of travel for both of you, and what it was that caused the damage (if you’re able to tell.) If you can’t tell what exactly it was that hit your vehicle, don’t lie and say it was something, because if you say it was a rock, but the truck was hauling mulch, they can use that to contest your claim. Also, if you can’t safely read or find a license plate (most states don’t have rear plates for trucks that size), a description of the truck. This isn’t a comprehensive list of details that you should compile, as always, the more information you have the better off you’ll be.

To be clear: this only includes things that fall off of or out of the trucks. It does not include things that may have been kicked up off the road. For example, if a truck hits a rock on the road, and that causes it to fly up and hit your windshield, that’s considered a road hazard, and they *aren’t* liable for that.
