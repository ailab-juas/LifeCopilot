YSK: when bullying starts at home, it lasts internally and forever

content:
Why YSK: When you start your kids life by bullying them about themselves, their abilities, their clothes whatever, that just internalizes and lasts with them forever. It might feel like “picking on” them but they’re your child and have less agency than you and that stuff hurts. Just don’t? 

Source; was bullied daily by my mother and aunt that lived with us and to this day I still have to have my clothes match perfectly and believe I’m not pretty enough among other things. In my thirties.
