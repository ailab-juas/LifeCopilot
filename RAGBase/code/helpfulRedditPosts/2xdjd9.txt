**=====================================================**

10 minutes left - this should be pretty definitive, right? Fresh dough is some sticky crap! Maybe I'll throw some shrimp in next? We'll see...    
     
**TAKING THEM OUT NOW - RESULTS TIME!**    
    
    
**CHECK THE ALBUM!**    
    
*The crumpled side was HARDER to remove than the smooth, and the smooth side cooked better!*    
**=====================================================**    
    
We're doing the test again ( /u/kurosen ) with the following changes:    
    
* [Less crumpled (more smoothed out, rather) crumpled side](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2x8ff5/lpt_crumple_aluminum_foil_before_use_to_keep_food/coy2jo6) ( /u/richstuff )    
* [smooth side will be *flipped to non-shiny side*](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2x8ff5/lpt_crumple_aluminum_foil_before_use_to_keep_food/coy66o6) ( /u/ryan_the_leach )     
* [NO cooking pictures](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2x8ff5/lpt_crumple_aluminum_foil_before_use_to_keep_food/coxzmvg), in case the light bulb 'greatly' affects the cooking :P ( /u/reddilada )    
    
**ALBUM IS BEING MADE NOW - WATCH BELOW, THEY'RE ABOUT TO GO IN!** (12:12CST)
    
    
**[THE album :)](http://imgur.com/a/qPaa0) (being updated realtime...)**    
    
*About 14 minutes left - NO door opening/light bulb frying photos today :D    
    
**=====================================================**        
    
**AAAAAAAAAND DONE!**    
    
-Smooth side wins again - less stickers, better cooked and better appearance :)    
    
*On a side note, looks like the oven light bulb didn't help with the cooking :P :P :P
