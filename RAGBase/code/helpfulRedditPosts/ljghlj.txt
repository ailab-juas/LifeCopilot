YSK you can use laser pointers with cats, but you should NOT use them with dogs

content:
Why YSK: Dogs are much more tactile animals when compared to cats and they need something physical to play with, in order to properly understand it.

Using a laser pointer might seem like fun because it can exercise them without any work, but it is actually causing them anxiety and potential issues with fixation and adverse reactions to light and shadows. There are good indoor alternative toys that I can recommend if anyone’s interested.  

I found this out a long time ago but realized I should post this after seeing an LPT promoting it.

Edit: I’m getting a lot of people saying that it’s not good for cats either, and I do agree that for any animal a physical toy is the best. 

**However, the average cat can play with laser pointers without issue as long as it’s done right - you should always end the play by putting it on a physical toy for them to attack.**

BUT, you should always try to understand how your cat is responding to the laser pointer and if you feel that it is negative then definitely don’t do it. I hope this post at the very least will cause people to research something that they may not have known about, and hopefully save some animals from unnecessary anxiety. 

[Here’s](https://petcube.com/blog/is-it-bad-for-cats-to-play-with-laser-pointers/) a website covering the pros/cons and how-to of using a laser pointer with cats.

EDIT #2: If you have a dog that you feel like has been affected negatively by a laser pointer and want to help them, search “dog light fixation” online or on YouTube to learn how to help them get over it! Here’s a video to get you started: https://youtu.be/3XOLftiqKbM
