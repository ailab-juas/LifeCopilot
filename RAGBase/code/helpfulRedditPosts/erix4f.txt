title:
LPT: pay attention to the end of prices while shopping at Costco

content:
&gt;In particular, look for:

&gt;Prices that end in 97¢: These have been marked down from the regular priced items, which end in 99¢


&gt;Odd pricing, such as 79¢, 49¢, or 89¢: These indicate specially priced items that Costco got a deal on from the manufacturer. These can be better deals than at other stores, but not usually better than the 97¢ markdown.


&gt;An asterisk* on the upper right side of the sign: The item won't be reordered.


&gt;88¢ or .00 endings: Manager markdowns. They use these to move a product very fast.
