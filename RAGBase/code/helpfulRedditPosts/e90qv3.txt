LPT: If you're really fucking poor, free condiments (mustard/bbq sauce/etc) are PACKED with spice and when added to hot water make a cheap, reasonably tasty base for a soup. If you already have soup, you can stretch it by using this base.

I aged out of foster care at 18, back in the 80's. I've "been there". And I know a hot, tasty bowl of soup can make life bearable for a few minutes. And even if you don't have any money at all, there are plenty of packets available in most fast food places. Now all you need is a cup of hot water (gas stations usually have hot water) and maybe some bits of food to throw in there (anything at all is better than nothing). And if it's all you got, at least you got something. 

My personal favorite: mustard and pepper - that's it. When you're cold and you have a hot cup of this very basic soup, it's comforting.

Good luck, and best wishes.

Someone mentioned a video about this kind of soup, so I looked it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZpxDxkppLY
