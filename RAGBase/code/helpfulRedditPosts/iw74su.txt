YSK If you drive a car, you need to get a dashcam.

content:
Picture this: You’re driving in the late evening down a side road when suddenly

**BAM!**

Deer runs right in the road in front of your car out of nowhere! You swerve out of the way missing the little fucker by a hair but hitting the tree on the side of the road. And you go through the motions, you get your car towed, you fill out a report and grab a taxi home.

The next day, you put in an insurance claim for the car, you say a deer ran out into the road and you swerved off to the side to avoid it.

“Prove it”.

But you can’t prove that something caused you to run off the road so you don’t get reimbursed. And not only that, but the insurance company hands the case off to the town and you get slapped with a reckless driving charge. All because you didn’t get $20 dashcam.

Why YSK is because no good driver ever wished they didn’t have a dashcam. If you end up having needed one, you REALLY needed to have one. When it comes in handy, it REALLY comes in handy. Get one.
