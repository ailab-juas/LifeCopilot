YSK you can get generic Plan B for free

Edit: message from Stix Co: Hi y’all - Cynthia here - co-founder of Stix. Thank you SO MUCH for all your support. In just 5 days, we have delivered over 7,000 free doses of Restart™ Emergency Contraception and have exhausted our supply of free doses. To keep this program running, please consider donating to cover the cost of Restart for somebody who cannot afford it.
If you need Restart for free, we’re collecting a waitlist and will release more free doses as soon as we have them.
Sent us a note if you have any questions – we’re here for you.

PLEASE consider donating if you are able to!! Even $20 for one more pill will help someone out there. Tell your friends and family to donate as well if they can :)


Why YSK: having Plan B on hand in case you need it is a smart choice for anyone who is sexually active and may get pregnant. Plan B can be expensive so getting it free is helpful for many of us. 

At this website. https://getstix.co/pages/emergencycontraception

You can get one free emergency contraceptive (and free shipping!). It is shelf stable for 4 [years](https://www.verywellhealth.com/stockpiling-plan-b-5271334)
so you can order it and keep it on hand in case you need it in the future. Please remember there IS the possibility that if you’re overweight it is less effective and there are other options (Ella or the copper IUD) but both of those need a prescription/doctor. 

You can also donate towards others getting it free if you’re able to!
