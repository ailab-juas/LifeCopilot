LPT: If you ever need to stop and ask directions, skip the gas station and find a pizza delivery place.

The drivers know the area better than anyone and they usually have a big honking map on the wall to show where they will and won't deliver too so you can avoid driving through the sketchy parts of towns you don't know.

Also, pizza.
