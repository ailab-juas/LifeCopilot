LPT: Buy restaurant-grade stuff. It lasts practically forever, and you can always find replacements to match

content:
I bought restaurant chairs (plain black) for $18 each. Same ones from the restaurant I use to work in. These are designed for high levels of use and abuse. They're rugged, easy to clean, and if I never to replace one or add a couple more, I can easily get matching ones, since they're the same model in use for decades now.

Same with everything else for the kitchen. Plates, glasses, flatware, can opening, pizza cutter. I use them less in a month than a restaurant would in a day and if you shop at any restaurant supply house (every major city has at least one, if not many) they cost roughly the same as any department store, they're just built to last.
