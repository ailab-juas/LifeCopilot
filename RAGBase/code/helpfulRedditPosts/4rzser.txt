YSK borrowing books from UK and Irish libraries directly supports the author

content:
You don't have to buy a book to help!

Assuming the author is registered for Public Lending Right (https://www.plr.uk.com), which many are, they will regularly receive a cheque that correlates to how many times their books were loaned out in libraries across the country.

Many authors rely on their income from PLR to keep going, and the money they receive can be a huge boon. I know for a fact there are some great second and third books out there that wouldn't exist without it.

The money comes from a government fund, so it's really important to visit libraries and make sure your local MP knows you want your local library to stay open!
