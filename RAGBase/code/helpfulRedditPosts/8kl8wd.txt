LPT: When you go to a big event with lots of people, change your phone lock screen background to a screenshot of text of a friend’s phone number. This way if you lose it and someone picks it up, they can immediately contact your friend without having to unlock or reset your phone.

My friends and I have had backgrounds that say “IF LOST CALL OR TEXT” + one or two of our phone numbers. It’s saved our asses more than once!
