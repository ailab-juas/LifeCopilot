LPT: If you ever need to roughly measure something small and you have no ruler, a one dollar bill is approximately 6 inches. Fold it in half once for 3" or twice for 1.5"

content:
To be precise, a USD bill is 6.14 inches. A Canadian bill is 152.4mm, which is almost exactly 6 inches. Sorry to all other 200+ countries for not doing the leg work for you, but the general idea is the same. Find out the size of your common bills and you have a handy measuring tool for life.

If you want to get really crafty you can fold it into thirds and then half to get an inch. With great power comes great responsibility.
