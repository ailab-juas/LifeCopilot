LPT: If "something funny" pops into your head after someone you just met tells you their name, don't share it with your newly found friend because they have heard it a million times.

content:
For example, I have a friend named Hanna.  She is from Montana.  Every time she introduces herself and it is later found out she is from Montana, there's a 15min conversation about Hanna Montana.  If I'm around, I walk away because I know it's coming.  She hates it.

If you thought of 'something clever' to say nano seconds after you heard something, chances are you're not the only one.
