EDIT:

You should also check out [Kunic's](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/s3o17/how_to_dominate_your_computer_using_the_ctrl_key/c4av8zy) suggestion of the subreddit /r/keyboardshortcuts.

Also sorry about the lack of Mac short cuts, but if you have any please pm me so I can add it here.

Thanks!
