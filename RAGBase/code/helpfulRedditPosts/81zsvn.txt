title:
YSK if your car's blinker starts blinking more quickly than usual you need to check your bulbs. One of them is likely not working.

content:
My wife casually mentioned that her left blinker was blinking at double speed and it was bugging her. I went to check her car, and the left rear blinker was completely blown. 

Most modern cars will do this to alert the driver that one of the bulbs isn't working correctly.

*Edit:* I agree everyone should already know this, but I’ve talked to enough people lately who didn’t know - particularly my 17 &amp; 18 year old students - that I though t warranted a YSK. Also, in full disclosure, I didn’t know this until I was in my 30s. 

I also had no idea that it was an unintentional “feature” created when one bulb dies his decreasing the resistance in the circuit (did I say that right?). Thanks for everyone educating me a little more.

*edit 2:* I’m out of the loop...what the hell are muffler bearings?
