LPT: If you can access water, a glass jar, a rubber band and a piece of fabric, you can grow sprouts from virtually every non-roasted seed, nut, and legume at the bulk store. Knowing how to grow fresh tiny greens packed with nutrition on the cheap is a sweet skill in strange times.

There's loads of info online, and it's **very easy to do**.

**MORE INFO**: You need to be careful with the seeds you use; no seeds treated with chemicals like the kind you'd find in a garden store, and the seeds must be clean and healthy. I'd suggest going online and researching thoroughly how to sprout safely as, like most things, there are risks if you  jump in without doing due diligence. An excellent source of sprouting seed, equipment and info is [sproutpeople](https://sproutpeople.org/).
