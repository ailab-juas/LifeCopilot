LPT: Strive to be the older person you’d wished was there for you when you needed it most coming up.

content:
Think about the struggles you went though when you were younger, be it a child, a teenager, or even well into adulthood....then look around your daily life to see if someone matches that description. It may be a younger coworker who needs some encouragement from a more experienced colleague, or a young niece or nephew who needs someone to really listen to them. Even a stranger in line at the convenience store. You’d be surprised how many people in your everyday life just need a tiny kindness &amp; understanding to make it to the next day.
