LPT: If you are submitting a message through a website, always copy the text first, so that if the submission doesnâ€™t go through for whatever reason, you can just paste the text instead of having to retype it all.

There were many times where I would type a message to a company of several paragraphs and then the page crashed for whatever reason without submitting the message, and I had to start all over.  Now, I copy any text before submitting, so that if I need to resubmit, all I need to do it paste.
