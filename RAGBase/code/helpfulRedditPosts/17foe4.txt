LPT: Any working cell phone, regardless of whether it is in service or not, will call 911.

content:
I have an old basic phone that I haven't used in quite some time and I carry it with me just in case.

edit: obligatory front page shock/surprise 

edit#2:  I guess I should clarify where the LPT of this information comes in.  I keep mine in backpacks that I carry around, along with other things that will come in handy should a situation arise.  It would not be a bad idea when going camping or in your car.
