YSK If you are on the phone and the CSR says that this call "may" be recorded for quality assurance, that every call "IS" being recorded. Use this to your advantage as well please.

Background in online lending. If they say you might, you definitely are being recorded. If you are handling a dispute with any company, ask up front to have any and all recordings of your interaction saved to your customer file. This helps you greatly when you have to make multiple calls to argue an issue. Just simply trying to recall a date, time and name are difficult enough, and usually companies won't even look. Asking that the phone recordings be reviewed by the manager can usually have a better outcome for your cause. I am looking at you Frontier, your CS and business practices are atrocious.

EDIT: This may vary by industry.
