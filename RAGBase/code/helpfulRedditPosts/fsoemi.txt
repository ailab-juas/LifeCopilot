YSK: That most disinfectant sprays need to be left on the surface you're spraying for 5 to 10 minutes before being wiped off.

I just checked the directions of use on a few of my disinfectant sprays and saw this.. I usually just wipe it off immediately. Probably good to know considering the current situation

Edit: This got more attention than I anticipated. To clarify this is not an April fools attempt. I was mainly talking about surface sprays not disinfectant aerosol cans. As mentioned in the comments, there are many products that are more suitable to use to disinfect or sanitize a surface.

Edit 2: thanks for the gold you absolute gem!
