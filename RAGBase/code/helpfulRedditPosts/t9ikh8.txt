YSK: If you regularly lie to people or exaggerate events, and no one has confronted you, your friends are likely aware of you lying, but choose to stay quiet

content:
A few times I’ve seen people on Reddit state different varieties of something like “I lie about little things here and there, but no one knows”, which is rarely true. Most of the time, the friend group is very aware of someone lying on a regular basis, but they choose to not confront it either out of apathy, or - more often - to not cause the liar embarrassment.

So, no, you’re not a good liar, you just have good friends.

Why YSK: Because don’t feel like you need to lie to make yourself more interesting. You’re enough just the way you are.
