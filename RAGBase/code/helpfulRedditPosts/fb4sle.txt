LPT: when dealing with a stubborn child under ~5, try offering them the choice, "can you do it yourself, or do you need my help?"

content:
Usually, they will go ahead and do the thing you want them to do, to prove that they can do it themselves. If not, you just physically help them do it by picking them up and moving them or whatever needs to be done.

I have been working with and studying young children for decades and this phrase helps me dozens of times per day. I use it when kids refuse to get off tricycles to come inside, when they refuse to go to the bathroom, when they refuse to give back a toy that they've just grabbed out of someone else's hand, when they won't come off of the play structure, when they won't stop climbing on something they're not supposed to, and more.

Obviously this is not 100% successful every time. Of course there are exceptions. Have other ideas in your pocket to fall back on. But this question helps me so much I thought it might help some of you folks too!
