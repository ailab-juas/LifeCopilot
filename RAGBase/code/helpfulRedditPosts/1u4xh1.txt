title:
LPT. Looking for good music to work to? Try video game soundtracks. The music's designed to provide a stimulating background that doesn't mess with your concentration.

content:
I found a thread by /u/robertgfthomas suggesting the idea and I messaged him about it also giving him some suggestions, I was creating a list for myself anyway. he suggested I post it here. Though I just checked and realized his original submission was here, I didn't realize at first and I wouldn't have posted it otherwise but it's a good tip and it was 2 months ago, I'm also adding a list of suggestions. If anyone has a problem just report it and the mods can take it down if they wish.

If anyone has any more suggestions add them in the comments. Maybe there should be a subreddit for this /r/backgroundmusic? Does anything like that exist already? And do people want it?

Oblivion, Skyrim and Fallout 3 all have music made by the person who made the music for that, Jeremy Soule. He has awards for music from other games as well so they'd be worth checking out, I don't know them though

Edit.

Also, /u/caligari87 told me that /r/backgroundmusic already exists, but it's small, everyone who likes this should join and post their favourite background song, that should increases it's popularity a bit.
