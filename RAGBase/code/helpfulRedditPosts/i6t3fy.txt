LPT Vet It Before You Spread It. Seriously folks, if a claim seems excessively preposterous or incendiary at least do a quick fact check on Google. The world will be a better place.

Edit: I figured this would get a bit if traction. It looks like I hit a nerve because there's a lot of updooting and commenting going on. A few bullets after reviewing many of the comments:

- Folks still have a sense of humor in a climate where it can be easily lost. Keep it up!
- Lots of concerns that this LPT is "preaching to the choir." I share those concerns.
- The goals of increasing the level of amity and honesty in the public sphere seem largely unattainable in light of how "they" consistently pervert and corrupt information.

I get it. This is too big an issue for us to address on our own. We are, however, not alone. So far it looks like at least 40k people kind of agree and nearly 1,000 care enough to comment. We are not alone. 

It gets tiring. I get frustrated when the same people do the same stupid shit. Lots of people (most?) will not change their behavior. However my hope when I respond by providing alternate sources is not necessarily that I will open op's mind to the glorious world of honesty. My hope is more that people watching the exchange will rethink their opinions. Lots of people follow conversations. Hopefully some of them will question the original post/comment. Shoot, they may even start researching on their own. 

I also feel some satisfaction when I see that my challenge to a post killed the thread. Minds may not have been changed, but at least I plugged one leak.
