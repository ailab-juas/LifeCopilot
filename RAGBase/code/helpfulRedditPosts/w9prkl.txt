title:
YSK that the U.S. Postal Service will forward your mail to a new address for free for 12 months.

content:
Why YSK: Moving is already stressful and expensive enough without worrying you're missing some of your mail. This free service gives you plenty of time to get your address changed with any services or organizations that you need to. 

I had no idea it was free until I just went to do it now. I assumed it would cost like $50 or something, so this was a very pleasant surprise!

Edit: I’d just also like to say that I don’t work for USPS so for all the people asking me specific questions about their circumstances, allow me to preemptively state: I have no idea, I don’t know, Google it.
