LPT: Do not own a dog you cannot physically control/restrain.

content:
You will save yourself money, criminal charges, time and physical pain by recognizing the limit on the size of animal that you can physically control and restrain. 

Unless you can perform unbelievably certain training and are willing to accept the risk if that training fails, it is a bad idea. 

I saw a lady walking 3 large dogs getting truly yanked wherever they wanted to go. If your dog gets loose or pulls you into another dog or worse a human/child, you will never have a greater regret.
