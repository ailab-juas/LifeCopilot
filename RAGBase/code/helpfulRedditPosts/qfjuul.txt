LPT: simple way to read articles behind paywall

content:
i've seen some other ways of doing this (i'm 100 yrs old when it comes to tech) but i accidentally figured this out other day and it seems to work for a bunch of articles. thought i'd share.

1. google search the title of the article
2. when you find it in the search results, control+click and hit Save As...
3. title it whatever, i save it to the desktop.
4. open the saved link &amp; enjoy

edit: yeah, pay for journalism when and if you're able to do so. 

edit edit: pay for journalism if you *want to*  I really don't care.

I posted the tip to share a helpful thing bc I think sharing knowledge is neat. i also didn't think many ppl would read this. if you'd rather pay then cool! do you. if not, ppl have left a bunch of other helpful tips in the comments.
