LPT: Bunnys are NO Easter gift.

content:
With easter coming around again there are many bunnies gifted away to children in too small cages and most of the time alone, and not neutered and/or spayed. 

Some facts for y'all.

Bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

They poop. A lot.

You need to clean their toilets. A Lot.

You need at least 2 Bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be Spayed*)


Bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

Bunnies are not for picking up! They are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

They need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

You need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

This post was created because my sister wanted to gift 1 bunny to my nephew and i had to talk her out of it, so please don't gift bunnies they are a fuckton of work.


Edit: Here have the Bunnies. Im not a native speaker.
