LPT: School ended for the year and you are applying for summer jobs? A few words of advice from HR.

Looking for a summer job this year? Here are a few words of advice.


If you come in person to interview or just to get an application, dress nice. Not saying you need a suit and tie to apply for a lifeguard position, but wear decent pants and a nicer shirt (ie: a polo shirt), not ripped jeans and a dirty "420 YOLO SWAG" shirt.


When you are talking to people look them in the eyes and engage them. I can't tell you how many people come in to apply for a job and look at their shoes the entire time and mumble responses to my questions.


Make sure your application is readable. I have shit for hand writing but when I was filling out applications it looked like I got an A+ in hand writing class. If I can't read it, I won't hire you. On the same vein, answer ALL the questions. Don't leave half the application blank and expect anyone to call you back.


Put the cell phone away. If you are waiting for someone that is fine, but when someone is talking to you put it away and don't bring it out again until you leave.


If you have questions about hiring, the position, or if there is any word on your application make sure that it is you that is calling, not mom or dad. It is a sign of maturity and that you are responsible enough to follow up yourself. It is a huge red flag if mom is calling me every day to ask questions for you or to push me to give you a job.


source: I do HR at a decent size country club and have been doing the hiring for the last few years and have reviewed more than enough terrible applications and candidates.



Edit: Some of you gave some good advice as well so I will add it as well:



*Use a blue or black pen to fill out an application.



*Don't bring friends with you to apply. 



*Have a professional email address, not  fingerbanger666@gmail.com 



*If possible hand an application to the manager not an employee.



*Don't show up when we are running around like mad people expecting anyone to talk to you or remember you.



*Don't apply too early (we forget about the application) or too late. Try and think of a reasonable time to apply, sorry it is vague advice.



*Don't be late and don't have a poor excuse.



*Know how to shake someone's hand.



*Be confident when you are applying in person.


*Be polite!
