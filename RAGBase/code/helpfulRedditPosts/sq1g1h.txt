title:
YSK about the 20 second rule

content:
If you notice something wrong with someone's appearance, don't point it out unless it can be fixed in 20 second or less. 

Loose hair, food in teeth, untucked shirt, etc. are all things that can be fixed very quickly. Acne, weight, etc. take a long time to fix, and the person you're talking to probably already knows about the problem, and drawing attention to it can make them self conscious.

Why YSK: Most people want to look their best, and finding out that something was wrong at the end of the day can be a bit disheartening. Politely pointing a small issue out can help them feel better about their appearance, even if only slightly.

(Time frames for this rule vary. I've seen recommendations from 5 seconds all the way to 2 minutes, so basically just have discretion)
