YSK: Subscribe to "difficult to cancel" services like the New York Times through the Google Play/Apple App stores whenever possible to be able to easily cancel later without speaking to a live agent.

Why YSK: Services such the NY Times are notorious for making you speak to a live agent and go though an arduous process to cancel the service you easily signed up for online.

Services like this are not rare and growing day by day, however many allow you to sign up through the Google Play/ Apple App Store if you do so via their mobile apps instead of the websites.

If you do this, you can easily cancel these subscriptions on your phone in just a few clicks without having to bother with each service's customer care.
