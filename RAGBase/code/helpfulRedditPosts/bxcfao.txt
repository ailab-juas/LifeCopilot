YSK about radio.garden, a site (and app) that lets you tune into thousands of live radio stations from all around the world using only an internet connection

content:
i found out about this app a few days ago and have been having so much fun. it offers a very unique way of exploring the world and all the different cultures out there, and i'm thoroughly enjoying it.

**EDIT**: as pointed out by RelinquishedAll in the comments, *radiooooo.com* lets you pick a decade and a country, and tunes you in to how radio was back then and there.

**EDIT 1**: if you have issue with ads on radio.garden try *RadioDroid*, a similar, adless app suggessted by nalk1710 in the comments. android only.
