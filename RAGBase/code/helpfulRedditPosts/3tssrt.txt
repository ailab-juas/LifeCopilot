LPT: Cold? Drinking something hot? Harness the power of your femoral arteries!

content:
My sister once told me that if you are really cold and you have a mug of hot coffee or tea, you should put it between your legs, against your femoral arteries. The warmth will circulate quickly throughout your whole body! It looks kind of funny, but it works! I get cold working the night shift (chilly office) and once I got over being self conscious about keeping my mug of tea between my legs, I can warm up my whole body with it! It keeps the mug warm too. Just don't spill or you'll burn your bits.
