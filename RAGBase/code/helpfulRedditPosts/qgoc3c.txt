title:
YSK that eating disorders are the mental illness most likely to cause death

content:
Why YSK: Eating disorders are often not taken as seriously as other mental illnesses but they should be.
By now we are all very aware of the dangers of suicide caused by mental health problems, but depression and related conditions aren’t even the most deadly of mental illnesses. Body shaming and the pressure to be thin has very serious risks for vulnerable people in society (not that that is necessarily the main or only cause of eating disorders). Be mindful of what you say about food or weight around vulnerable people, and if you suffer from an eating disorder please know that you matter and please seek help.

EDIT:
please note that I’m not an expert, just a student, but i know this fact and think everyone else should too. Please see some of the comments below for more information about eating disorders, especially because there are often misconceptions out there.
