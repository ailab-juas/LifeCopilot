YSK that there are hundreds of jobs, even entire fields, that you have never even heard of. This is especially good to know if you are feeling limited in your job search or career options.

Seriously.  People get paid to do anything and everything.  Some ideas for broadening your scope:

- Volunteering some time with an organization you aren't familiar with is a GREAT way to begin.  Ask around or start looking on search engines and social media.  Targeted ads will start appearing, potentially leading you to new opportunities.  If you have a communal recreation center or university/college in your town, those are also great ways to begin connecting with new people and opportunities.

- Speaking of targeted ads, search (whatever hobby/sport/field you're interested in) and then the word jobs.   It doesn't have to be in your area, but it could get you started in the right direction to finding related positions, which you can then google for further detail.  Ads may also start appearing for that line of work in or near your area, if work is available.

- Look for weekend or weeklong courses in your area.  Sign up for one, and ask the other participants what they do for a living and why they're taking the course.  First aid is a great start if you don't have it, as many different jobs require it, but literally anything is useful to some degree.  Pick whatever interests you.  Or, if you can and want to, check out full courses at a university or college.

- Look up courses in a university website.  Read their descriptions.  Search jobs that need xxxx for whatever catches your attention.  Follow the rabbit trails.

- Look in your local classified ads for temporary or weekend type jobs that can give you a taste in something new without a huge time commitment (if you don't have time to give - if you do, longer term temporary or seasonal jobs are fantastic for trialing new fields of work or study!)

- Search temporary or seasonal jobs in your area, for the reasons mentioned above.

- Look beyond the classified ads.  Every city and government have their own Careers page.  Look on university websites, many have job pages specifically for students who need summer jobs etc.  Check out the websites of your favorite companies to shop at.  Check out the websites of companies in that field you've always thought it would be cool to work in.  

- Look into volunteering internationally if you are able.  Different organizations around the world offer all kinds of cool knowledge and practice for skills you might never have an opportunity to experience at home.

- Lastly, just look around you.  You might be surprised.  Someone needs to wash the traffic lights.  Someone needs to paint the murals.  Someone needs to shut the gates at your local park when it closes.  Ask people how they got their jobs.  Ask everyone - the girl who took your photo at the carnival, the guy who sold your neighbour his hay, the guy who booked your campsite.  Even if you aren't interested in their actual job(s), they may point you to a resource you hadn't considered before.

The job of your dreams is waiting for you!  Good luck!
