LPT: Don't point it out when someone is quiet/doesn't talk much

content:
97% of the time, a non-talkative person is already aware that they are quiet. We already know. In fact, most of the time we are already straining our social muscles to the limit just to not appear indifferent or rude. 

A lot of people think that pointing it out and statements such as "Why are you so quiet?" is an easy joke/tease to break the ice, but it just puts us on the spot. There really isn't a great follow-up answer to say.

And it is just annoying.

Instead, if you really want to help to get someone talking more, simply direct a question to them that would be easy to answer and allow them to naturally enter the flow of the conversation. 
It is especially great to do this when in a group.

Edit: The point is simply that the fact that an individual is quiet does not have to be said out loud. I did NOT mean that introverts shouldn't make an effort to talk if they want to be included or that extroverts should just ignore them.
