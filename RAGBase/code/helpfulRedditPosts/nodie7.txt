LPT: It's a better investment to rent bridesmaids dresses, and purchase fitted suits, rather than the other way around. The dresses are typically worn once, suits can be worn for many occasions.

Obviously depends on style choice of the wedding. However, in general bridesmaids dresses cost hundreds of dollars and are worn only for the wedding day. However, a properly fitted suit can be used for many other well-dressed events - especially interviews.   


My wife used a designer rental site and ended up getting really nice dresses for a low price. Each suit before tailoring was priced at around 200-300. Then we took it to a local tailor to be fitted ($50). I wore that suit to many interviews and ended up getting a job in it! Also wore it to several other weddings where I wasn't in the wedding party. Still have it too.
