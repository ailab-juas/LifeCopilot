LPT: No Refund Policy? No problem! (California Only)

content:
So recently I found myself out $50 when my boss decided that the candles I had purchased for him from the Dollar Tree weren't the ones he needed. He instructed me to return them, but when I arrived to the store, I was told that they don't allow refunds and only offer store credit.

I asked if it was possible to put the store credit onto a gift card so that I don't have to lug around a bunch of candles in my car. The cashier told me that it was indeed possible. So I returned all 49 items and split them onto multiple gift cards ranging from $5 - $9. Then I asked them to cash it out. And under CA law, any gift cards with a balance of less than $10 must be redeemable for cash if requested by the consumer.

10 minutes later. TA-DA cash refund!
