title:
LPT Practice now before it's too late-Set off your smoke alarm and call your pets, give them a treat. When the smoke alarm does go off, with your practice, they will come running when you call them saving your time and life looking for them if there is a real fire.

I've been practicing this by putting a candle up to our smoke alarm. Hopefully, I will never need to really use this.
