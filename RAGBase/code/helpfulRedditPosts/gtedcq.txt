title:
LPT: if someone falls down around you, don't help them get up until you are SURE they aren't injured

content:
this applies to bad falls. if someone gets up before you can help them, let them, but i see that many people's first reaction to a rough fall is to grab the persons arms and get them back up. never do that. instead, kneel down next to them, place your hand on their shoulder and ask if they are okay and then specifically ask them if they injured. 

"are you okay?" 
"yeah."
"you aren't hurt or anything?"
"no."

this is an easy and crucial step to take to prevent further injury. head injury can cause someone to look stunned or confused rather than injured or in pain so you need to let them tell you if they are okay or not before getting them back up. moving them can cause seizure, brain bleeding, brain swelling, or all three. also legally, you could be held liable for these injuries if you do not have a person's explicit consent to help them.

back injuries or spinal injury can also cause someone to not appear to be in any pain, so again, ask them if they are injured before helping them up. moving them could cause further damage and you could be liable.

unexpected injuries, even minor ones can put people into adrenaline rush where they do not feel their own pain. by asking them if they are okay and then asking them if they are injured, you can help them take stock of their own body, calm down, and reduce their fear, confusion, and embarrassment around the situation.
