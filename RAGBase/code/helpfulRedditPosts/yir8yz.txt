LPT: Don’t feel bad about quitting your job, they REALLY don’t care whether you leave or stay.

content:

I remember when I was quitting my last job that I felt heavy guilt. A day or two later I forgot about everyone there. 

Some jobs will try and make you feel guilty for leaving but once you leave, you’ll become old news. Your fellow staff members may be sad that you’re leaving, but they’ll forget after an hour. 

Recalling my first job when one of my coworkers were leaving, it was a whole going away party while she was there. The moment she left, it was back to regular programming.

So if you’re feeling like leaving for whatever reason then leave cause in the end of the day, you’re replaceable and even if you aren’t replaceable…YOU’RE REPLACEABLE!

This is a tip for myself too.

Edit 1: I really don’t understand how people can misunderstand my post, I’m not saying that you should leave your job out of nowhere, burn bridges or what have you 

I’m saying that if you **WANT** to leave your job and you’re feeling guilty **DON’T** cause after you leave people will move on. Regardless if you’re on good terms with everyone or not, people will find a replacement. They may not be as good as you…but you’ll be replaced, they may miss you…but they’ll still have to find a replacement. 

If you’re in a great position, then by all means stay if you want to. If you have a manager that is great to you, **AMAZING**. But for people who are being manipulated into staying in their jobs or whatever and you wanna leave, do yourself the favour and leave. The cogs will keep rolling with or without you. 

I really don’t get why people are taking this so personally 

And also at least have a back up plan when leaving.
