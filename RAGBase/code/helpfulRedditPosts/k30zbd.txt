LPT when you move you should pack a suitcase for yourself as if you were going on a trip so that you can access what you need without going through boxes to find it.

Since 2016 I've moved 5 times and I've learned a lot in that time. The biggest thing I learned is to pack a suitcase with clothes, personal hygiene products, a book and charging chords. This makes getting ready for bed or work the day (s) after the move much easier.
