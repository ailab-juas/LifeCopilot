LPT: make a list of meals for the week and create your grocery list based on the menu

content:
Didn't realize how uncommon I am but a lot of people I know have tons of food waste by not eating their purchases. I have a bookmark list of good recipes on my phone, I've just searched and added recipes over the years. Each week I scroll through the list and choose 7 suppers (most of my recipes leave enough for leftover lunches the next day). Then I make a list of ingredients for those meals, plus any extra items. I can be done a weeks worth of shopping with a toddler and newborn in tow, in 30 mins

Edit: Here is my old menu http://pdfsr.com/pdf/microsoft-word-weekly-meals.docx
Now for vegan meals I use the oh she glows website and app. Really easy and delicious meals, haven't found one yet that I didn't like. 

Edit: Just wanted to add to the 100 or so posts shocked that people don't do this. I know it seems surprisingly intuitive, but I am one of only a handful of people I know that does this. My coworkers are always baffled that I come to work each day with home-cooked leftovers from the night before, while they are eating their pizza pop or sandwich. When I grew up my mom would cook maybe 1 meal a week, the rest would be ready made meals or take out. When she would grocery shop we would go down each aisle and she would just grab what looked appealing and it would take an hour and a half to grocery shop. So no not everyone does this, but when you do it it comes so naturally that it seems weird that people don't do it.
