YSK: Down commands (sit, stay, lay down) are by far the most important things you can teach a dog and should be prioritized above all else

content:
Why YSK: as adorable and intelligent dogs can be, they can really only learn from experience and tend to be REALLY bad at assessing when a situation is dangerous. To them, that shard of broken glass is just a shiny piece of gravel and a busy roadway is just an even bigger sidewalk. 

These might not be as flashy as shaking hands or barking on command, but learning to stay exactly where they are when you need them to can be the difference between life and death and should be the absolute first thing you teach them.
