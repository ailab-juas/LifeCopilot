LPT: before having a discussion or a debate, ask the other party why they think someone would adopt your position instead of theirs, e.g. "why do you think some people favor vaccinations?" You will quickly discover whether a debate is worth it.

A lot of people in my inbox are missing the point. /u/GooseJaw summarized it best:

&gt;OP is telling you how to know whether or not a person’s opinion is reasoned.  You can’t reason a person out of a position they didn’t reason themselves into.

The content of your 'opponent's' response is completely irrelevant. All that matters is that they have based their position on reason. Otherwise, a productive debate is unlikely.
