LPT: If you know someone who startles easily, don't laugh at them when they jump, and DO NOT start startling them on purpose. It could be a trauma response.

content:
People who have been through trauma frequently have exaggerated startle responses. 


For some reason a lot of people think it's hilarious when someone jumps and will then take every opportunity they can to "prank" that person. It's almost never funny to that person. 


Even if it isn't a trauma response, causing someone to feel fear and then laughing at them for it is a dick move.
