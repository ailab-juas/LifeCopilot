LPT: Clear a room full of smoke in just a few minutes.

content:
Soak half of a towel in water, and wring the excess water out.  Holding the dry end, swirl the wet portion carefully in a circle over your head.  I don't know why this works, but my grandmother showed it to me.  It works fast.

Protip.  I'm talking about a room full of cigarette or other consumed smoke.  If your house is on fire throw that wet towel over your head and GTFO.  :)

&gt;This works because smoke is a colloid. A colloid "is a substance microscopically dispersed throughout another substance". This example of a colloid is a solid suspended in gas. The solid particles in the smoke will stick to the wet portion of the towel therefore eliminating the smoke.
