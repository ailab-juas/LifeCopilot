LPT: If you are buying anything for your wedding, do not tell the vendors it’s for a wedding. Just say a party. Most companies charge 3-4x for weddings even if it’s the same stuff.

content:
This includes cakes. You can just say it’s for a party before the wedding. Same cake. Hundreds of dollars cheaper.

Edit: I guess I need to clarify a bit. If a vendor is attending the wedding, don’t try to bamboozle them. This is for stuff that you pick up (Tents, chairs, cake, lights, etc.)

Any vendors coming to the wedding should be prepared that it’s a wedding (band, photographer, caterer etc).
