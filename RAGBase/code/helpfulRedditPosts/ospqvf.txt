LPT: When discarding hot grease and fat, make a little cup out of tin foil and pour it in. Then once it solidifies you just ball up the foil and throw it away.

I'll grab mug from my cupboard and then shove some foil in it. 

That way you don't dirty any dishes and you dont have to keep some dirty old can or jar full of fat lying around.  

I will use a can or jar if I opened one during that cooking session though.
