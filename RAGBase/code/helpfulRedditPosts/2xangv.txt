LPT:how to treat every gun that you may find yourself holding.

content:
A lot of people don't know how to safely handle a gun and may find themselves being in the presence of one at some point in their life. Follow these simple rules and no one will ever be accidentally hurt.

-treat every gun as if it is loaded regardless of whether it is or not.

 -never point the gun at anything that you don't intend to shoot.

 -never put your finger on the trigger unless you're going to shoot it. Always keep your finger extended along the barrel. 

-always be aware of what is in the vicinity of or behind what you may be shooting at.

Simple simple rules but people that are unfamiliar with guns constantly make mistakes that could easily kill themselves or others.

If you're unloading/loading, cleaning or handing a gun to someone be especially aware of where your trigger finger is.
