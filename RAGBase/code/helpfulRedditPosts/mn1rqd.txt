LPT: If you have to put an animal down, bring one of their blankets.

content:
I had a cat who went to skin and bones very quickly. Dropped her off at the Vet and got a call that her kidneys have failed and it was time to put her down.

So when I bring her blanket to the vet. When she sees me she's freaking out and crying. Once I took the Doctor's blanket off and put her blanket around her, she calmed down immediately. It made her last moments that much better.  


Edit: For those who keep suggesting to make sure you are with your animal at the end, I was. I didn't just drop off a blanket.
