LPT: If your air conditioner isn't cooling as well as it used to, spray off the outside AC unit (the condenser) with a garden hose.

It's a simple way to keep your AC performing at top condition.

The outside "box" of your air conditioning system is called the "condenser." That's what acts as the heat exchanger between your home and the outside--those cooling vanes in the condenser act like your car's radiator by taking heat to the outdoors. 

Dust and debris can clog the cooling vanes, making them much less efficient. Dirty cooling vanes can diminish system efficiency as much as a dirty filter can. **Use a garden hose (not a brush, or a high-pressure washer, which can damage the fragile cooling vanes) to thoroughly rinse off the vanes.** 

It's good practice to clean them (and weed/trim grass) around the condenser once a year, early in the season. Depending on your environment, you may need to clean more often.
