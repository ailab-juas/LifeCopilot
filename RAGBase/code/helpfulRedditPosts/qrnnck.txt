LPT: Always thank your customer service people/business contacts by name at the end of a meeting or phone call. I can’t begin to measure how much most people light up if you simply remember their name and offer them a kind thank you.

Edit: since many people are taking this out of context. I feel the need to clarify that nowhere in this post have I advocated you go out to all your local retail spaces and start memorizing peoples names so as to make their days as creepy as possible close to the Halloween season.  

Customer service encompasses a wide range of things and is not even remotely limited to retail front end work. Customer service isn’t even the primary role of most retail workers, especially not if you consider some of the attitudes people will have in those jobs.  

Perhaps just because you have some antisocial tendencies you like to pretend don’t exist doesn’t make the common courtesy of addressing eachother by name an attack on all things good and holy. Lol.

Just be nice?
