LPT: if you see one or two cockroaches in your kitchen, probably, there are dozens more

content:
Cockroaches have a tendency to hide really well and away from sight. If you see one or two in your cupboards there are going to be several more. Happened to me yesterday where I saw one and sprayed cockroach killer spray promptly to have at least a 100 crawl out and die over the night. Not a pleasant sight.
