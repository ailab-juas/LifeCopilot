LPT: If u cant sleep because ur cat goes crazy every time u try, just put his tail into a cup with water.

content:
For a very long time, I couldn't sleep because whenever I tried to, my cat went insane, running all over the house, and meowing so loudly that I couldn't sleep at all. When it came out that my friend used to have a similar problem, he told me about an easy solution for that. Every time he was about to sleep, he just poured some warm water into a cup, and put his cat's tail into it. He told me that it usually takes about 2 hours until he finishes to lick it, so there was always enough time to fall asleep before he finished. 

I hope it helps some of u who have a similar problem.
