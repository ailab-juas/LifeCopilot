YSK: If you are taking care of a loved one who is chronically ill or disabled there are programs that will pay you to become an unskilled caregiver

Why YSK: you shouldn't have to choose between making a living and taking care of your loved one. You don't need credentials or any type of certification to become an unskilled caregiver.


My grandma was diagnosed with lung cancer in January, and my grandpa's dementia has gotten so much worse as a result. Its come to the point where they need someone there to help out and take care of them just about 24/7. I quit my job in February so I can take care of them full time. 


Naturally, I was worried about how I was gonna make my bills every month. I refuse to choose one or the other and I made that decision as soon as I committed to taking care of them. They went above and beyond as far as helping raise me when I was a kid. My mother struggled with drug addiction for most of her life and they took me on to raise when I was about 8 without any hesitation, even though they were both past 65 at that point. They provided me with the opportunity to be stable enough to go on and graduate high school. So honestly I feel honored to have this opportunity even if the situation is shitty. Its the least I can do.


So if you find yourself in a similar situation, just know that there are programs that will enable you to take care of your loved ones when they need you most without the possibility of becoming homeless in the process. Im sure the programs vary from state to state, Im in Texas and the program is through Medicaid. 


Everyone should know about this.
