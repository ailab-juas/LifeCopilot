LPT: If you buy something on Amazon and the price goes down within 30 days of your purchase, you can e-mail them and they will refund how much the price went down.

I bought a Razer Nostromo gaming keypad for $60 less than a month ago and it went down to $53. I e-mailed them and asked them to refund $7 dollars into my gift-card balance, and they did :) It only applies to items sold by Amazon LLC, though. It's something they do but don't advertise, and in my humble opinion it's pretty awesome :D
