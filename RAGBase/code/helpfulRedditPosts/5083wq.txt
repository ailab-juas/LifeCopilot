LPT: Train your puppy to ring a bell you hang by the door so he/she can let you know audibly when they need to go outside.

content:
I've done this with each of my dogs and it has worked wonderfully. It gives them a chance to audibly ask to go outside even when I'm not near the door. This in turn prevents scratching at the door (which can cause damage) and helps prevent accidents earlier on in life when potty training.

**Edit: Had requests about how to train this. Here's how:**

It's all about the treats and praise! What I do is I start by ringing the bell and giving a treat. I do this for a while until I notice the dog has associated the sound with receiving a treat (they'll lick lips or run over to the bell or something similar once they get it).

Then I'll ring the bell but make them go outside to get the treat (training them that bell rings, then you go outside, then you get a treat).

Then I'll take their paw or snout and physically make them touch the bell. Then we go outside and they get a treat. 

Eventually they'll connect the dots. Bell = outside. Treats can be withdrawn as outside is a reward in and of itself (running in the yard, peeing, chasing a squirrel, etc). 

It hasn't taken me long - just a couple days with even a few month old puppy. They learn fast!
