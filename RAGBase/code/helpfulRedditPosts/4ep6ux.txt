LPT If you are going to paste a long command in a Linux terminal, type '#' beforehand; in case the paste comes already with an ENTER, the command will not execute and you have a chance to review and change before executing it.

Wow I'm surprised how many Linux users there are here. It says something about Reddit demographics.

Many pointed to the C-x C-e trick to bring the editor ($EDITOR). Definitely useful for multiple lines but when you know it is just one line the # is way faster.

Also, AFTER you have pasted it, you can use C-a (or HOME) to go to the beginning of the line and remove the # and hit ENTER right there, you dont need to go to the back of the line again.
