LPT: Before you fly, take a shower, brush your teeth, wear deodorant and make sure youâ€™re wearing clean clothes

content:
Stuff happens. Youâ€™re running late, you forgot to wash your clothes, itâ€™s an early flight and you ran out the door without brushing your teeth. But seriously, try try try to have good hygiene, even better than you normally do. 

Spaces are pretty cramped and you will ðŸ’¯ smell the person next to you and appreciate if they do not smell bad.

Edit to add: I think this is especially relevant due to work from home + increased cases of depression and anxiety from the pandemic. Sometimes these things get away from youâ€”this isnâ€™t a post attacking anyone or saying people are gross, just a reminder :) will be better for everyone if we remember

Edit 2: love how passionate peeps in the comments are

Edit 3: wrote this post right before I left for the airport in the anticipation that I might sit next to someone w bad hygiene. 

I get to my gate and the whole gate area had a really off/sweaty smell. So yes, it needs to be said.
