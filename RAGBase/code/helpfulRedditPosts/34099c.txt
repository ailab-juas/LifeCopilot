LPT: Keep a few gift cards and vague birthday cards in your house in case you forget to get a gift.

content:
E.g. Walmart, popular restaurants, etc.

Too many times have I seen people forget and forget myself to get a gift for a birthday.

Edit: Make sure to use the gift cards before they expire if no emergency that requires them arises before the expiry date.
