LPT: Take on a mortgage that can be supported by one person's income when in a relationship.

content:
Context: Homes are expensive. Some say they are the most expensive thing you will buy. Regardless of your level of income between spouses, one should be able to pay the entire mortgage payment reasonably during the month. 

Why this matters: Life is unexpected. We do not know what comes tomorrow or the next day. Being able to pay your mortgage on one person's income is financially responsible and critical. Specifically, if your S/O loses their job, is in an accident, you have a divorce, or anything that involves a single party to pay for an extended period of time - it is better that it is manageable.

Notes: While a single payer is covering the mortgage, use the 2nd person's income to help pay off the mortgage or save more for these bad times.  Additionally, taking on a 30 year mortgage decreases the monthly payment allowing for extra flexibility when times get rough.
