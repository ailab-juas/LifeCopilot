title:
YSK that using a microwave power setting is the easiest way to reheat food

content:
Why YSK: most reheating goes like this: microwave food for a minute, stir, repeat, stir, repeat. If you use a half power setting and microwave for the same amount of time or even a minute longer, your food will heat evenly throughout with no hot or cold spots and no need to stir in the middle of the process.
