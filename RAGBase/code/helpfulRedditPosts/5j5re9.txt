LPT: if you have a lot to do and feel overwhelmed, do one tiny thing everyday.

content:
If you wait until you have the motivation to do everything you have to at once, that day may never arrive. If you do one step towards completion every day, one day you'll have it done.

Clean one drawer of your closet. Read a couple pages of your book. Wrap one gift. Pay one bill.

You will feel better about yourself and help dealing with procrastination.

Edit: if you are the kind of person who does everything right away so you are free from the tasks, this tip is not meant for you.

Edit2: this is assuming you wouldn't do anything while waiting for the motivation to do so. If you have a deadline, then find another strategy.

Edit3: what a weirdly pleasant mix of people thanking me a lot and calling me a piece of shit over this ðŸ’™ my DM box has never been this active!
