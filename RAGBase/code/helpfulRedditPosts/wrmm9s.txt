LPT: Remind yourself every now and then that the news is news because it's some sort of anomaly. "Normal" events and behaviors aren't typically covered at all

content:
I've seen a lot of posts from people asking about if certain places are as crazy or bad as international news makes them seem. 

While bad things happen, it's also important to remember the billions of little positive interactions people have with each other every single day. The news has no interest in reporting all the times someone held the door open for a stranger or picked up a piece of trash that wasn't theirs.

Remembering that the news is only news because it's a story that is relatively rare in day-to-day life can help make this world seem less bleak.
