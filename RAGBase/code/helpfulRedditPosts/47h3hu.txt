LPT: If you have a long commute, listen to stand up comedy on your way to work.

content:
This will help put a smile on your face early in the morning and help you start your work day with a positive attitude. It's also is a great day way to past time.

I wake up early to drive 2 hours to work. I'm  usually cranky and groggy in the morning, especially since I work in IT and spend the most of my day explaining to people the importance of rebooting their PC's. I started listening the random stand up on my way in on Spotify, and it makes the drive a breeze. Most importantly, it keeps a smile on my face, even on the most stressful days.  

EDIT: For those wondering what I've listened to recently, here you go:

* Mike Birbiglia (favorite comedian hands down)
* Eugene Mirman 
* Patton Oswalt
* Jim Gaffigan
* Demetri Martin
* Louis CK

Also, for those who think I'm crazy for having a job with such a long commute, I get paid for the drive and it's usually part of my 9 hour work day.
