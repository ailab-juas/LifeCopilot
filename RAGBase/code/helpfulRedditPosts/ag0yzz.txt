YSK your normal sleep position when buying a pillow. The objective for most people's comfort is to keep a straight spine. If you sleep on your stomach, thin pillow. On your back, medium pillow. On your side, thick pillow.

I used to struggle finding a good new pillow even when I splurged for the more expensive ones. I always found myself tossing the pillow aside and using my arms, or pulling my raggedy old one back out. Turns out I was just buying too thick of a pillow as I hadn't considered my normal sleep position.
