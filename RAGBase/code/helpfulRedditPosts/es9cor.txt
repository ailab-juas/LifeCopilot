LPT: Apply for jobs you want, not just the jobs you qualify for.

content:
Like the title says, apply for the jobs you want, now. Don't just apply to the jobs you're qualified for. You never know, you might be the exact right person a company is looking for, even though you don't really qualify for it. I've hired plenty of people even though they didn't meet the requirements for the position, and it has turned out great every time. I'm NOT saying that you should lie about you and/or your skills. Always be honest! 

So if you're looking for a job, apply for your dream job! Because you never know. Another thing is that you should also apply for jobs that doesn't have open positions. They might be in the works of putting out an ad nd you saving them the trouble. Timing is a powerful thing. The worst thing that can happen is that they say no.  But they can also say yes.

Dress nice, be polite, have a firm handshake with eye contact and go get them tigers!
