LPT It’s Friday night and all the good restaurants are packed ? Go to a 4 star hotel bar/restaurant. You’ll get great food, great atmosphere, great service, and you won’t have to wait for a table.

This works really well here in San Antonio, TX, where I live. Not sure about other places.

Most 4 star hotels have a restaurant and/or bar and many of them are relatively empty on the weekends. Hotel guests usually like to eat out in the town they’re visiting on the weekends, so the restaurant/bar is usually not too busy. 

You’ll often get great food, great atmosphere, and great service. And you won’t have to wait for a table. And the place won’t be too crowded.

No, you don’t have to be a guest of the hotel to eat in their restaurant. They actually love when non-guests come in to eat.

Not sure if this will work outside the USA, but it works for me quite well.
