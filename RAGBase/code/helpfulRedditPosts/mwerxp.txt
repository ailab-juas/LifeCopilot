YSK that if you care about the bees, you shouldn't be mowing or killing the dandelions on your lawn in the early springtime.

content:
Why YSK: According to experts, in early spring dandelions can be a crucial food source for the bees after a long winter of living off their reserves. Spring can be a difficult time for the bees as they become active at 10C/50F, which is usually well before many pollinating flowers have bloomed. Dandelions grow early in the season in large numbers, and quickly generate lots of pollen for the bees to collect.
