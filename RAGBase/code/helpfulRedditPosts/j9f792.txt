YSK how to escape a human bite

content:
Why YSK: Human bites are extremely dangerous. The jaw has a huge amount of force and oral bacteria can infect a human bite wound. The teeth can easily penetrate down through layers of skin and into muscle. Trying to rip your arm, or your whatever, out of their mouth will cause serious extra harm. 

To stop a bite, human (this also works for canine) brace and push the part of you that is being bitten into their mouth with force. Push them back against a building or wall to allow more force to push into their mouth. This is sometimes called ‘feeding the bite.’ Being physically close to them also minimizes the damage they can do to the rest of your body and they can’t rip your skin as easily. 

Their jaw will release and press open for you to get free and get out of there. The wounds won’t tear, you’ll be treating punctures not shredded skin and muscle. In addition specifically for people bites, take your first finger, and put it under the nose (like you were making a mustache on the biter) and VIGOROUSLY rub back and forth and push up onto that small protrusion of bone at the base of the septum, it’s called the nose saw and people often let go because a. It’s weird and b. They release the jaw to back away from it. 

As soon as the jaw releases, run as fast you can out of the area. Go to the ER, call EMS if you need help controlling bleeding.
