LPT: Be more exciting to people/friends/dates AND keep track of your life by a daily 3 bullet-pt journal entry.

MY DAILY 3: 

I realized that the friends I like hanging out with the most are the ones who are always telling stories and stuff that they did, no matter how unexciting it was. I'm not vocal about what I do b/c I can never remember what I've done yesterday or last week and that makes convos harder with anyone except the best of friends including acquaintances and girls I wanna hit on. So I've started keeping a daily journal entry: just a quick bullet pt thing like this: 

- watched 22 Jump Street  
- ran 3 miles, need to buy new running shoes
- learned new things to try out 

None of these are particularly exciting but atleast I have stuff to talk about when I run into ppl. ALSO this helps me keep track of how my day went, what I'm happy/unhappy with and what I may want to accomplish the next day. Once you start to see what you've done the whole week you'll have a TON of stuff to talk about and you'll have a better Idea of what next week should be like.  The reason it works so well is that it doesn't have the Pressure of being a goal or to-do list bc its already happened and since its got social benefits its really killing 2 birds with one stone.
Next time you see someone, perhaps you'll have more to say than just " hey, hows it going? oh not much im just chillin."

TRY it right now!
