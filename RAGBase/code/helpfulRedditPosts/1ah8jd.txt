LPT:  Always take few minutes to check for bed bugs when staying in a hotel.  Checking as soon as you enter the room can save you thousands of dollars and prevent tons of frustration.

Many of us are on spring break and traveling this time of year, so I thought it might be a good idea to remind everyone how important it is to check for bed bugs when traveling.

I really had no clue how prevalent the bed bug problem was until I started working in the hotel industry.  Virtually *all* hotels, regardless of quality and price, get them from time to time.  If bed bugs ever make it to your home, you will rue the fact that you didn't take a few minutes to search for them when you first arrived.

Here's a [3 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcCfbxj_m8) from YouTube that shows the proper way to check a hotel room.  Do this every time *before bringing your luggage in the room* and hopefully you'll stay bed bug free.
