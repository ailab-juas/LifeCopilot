title:
YSK a sudden loss of vision affecting both eyes is a sign of a stroke

content:
30-50% of strokes involve vision loss, yet most people do not know that you can lose vision from a stroke and it is not part of the FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) acronym for stroke. I work with stroke victims a many noticed the vision loss but tried to sleep it off, not knowing it was a stroke and delaying their treatment during a crucial time. 

If you notice a loss of vision in the periphery of both eyes, call your doctor.

Edit: everyone has a problem with the “call your doctor” part. Let’s modify that to “call the appropriate medical professionals.” That can be different for different people, so use your best judgement
