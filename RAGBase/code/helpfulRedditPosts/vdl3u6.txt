LPT If youâ€™re cleaning broken glass from the floor, dim the lights and hold a torch parallel to the floor to illuminate small shards you may have missed

Does your flashlight literally flash when you use it or does it emit a solid stream of unbroken light? Not every name is literal. Some countries use a different word than you. If you come from a country that still uses Fahrenheit and the imperial system, you donâ€™t have a leg to stand on if youâ€™re arguing we should change our vocabulary to make it more â€˜logicalâ€™. 

EDIT to save another 20 identical comments

1) Torch = flashlight (we donâ€™t all speak â€˜Americanâ€™ ðŸ˜‰)

2) For those saying â€˜just vacuumâ€™, duh, use this technique to make vacuuming easier. Iâ€™ve had my cat knock every glass candle in the house off the bench and onto the concrete floor the last few weeks and using this method helped me find glass scattered in far away areas I never would have vacuumed and may have otherwise missed.
