YSK: Should you ever be sexually assaulted/raped, you can go to a hospital to have a "Jane Doe rape kit", which is an anonymous collection of DNA and other evidence. It will cost you nothing and you are under no obligation to file a police report.

content:
I am not an expert, however I do know that there is absolutely no charge to you and that you DO NOT have to press charges.  This is a service to help with those cannot for any reason immediately file a police report, etc.

Every state law is different and the statute of limitation on how long you may wait to report a sexual assault varies. 

I hope this helps even one person and that this can be more well-known information. 

Here is a link to the RAINN website for more information: http://www.rainn.org/get-information/sexual-assault-recovery/rape-kit

EDIT: If you have questions, please, please view the website. It answers what goes into the kit, what they look for, what you should do, etc. I am merely passing on a basic summary.

EDIT2: I apologize for neglecting to acknowledge men as victims, it was not my purpose to act as if men are sexually assaulted. It is my understanding that this service is also available to men and I know RAINN counsels men as well, they mostly hear from men needing to get over being assaulted as boys.

That means it does not have to be recent for you to get help! Please visit the RAINN website or call their hotline if they can help you in any way.
