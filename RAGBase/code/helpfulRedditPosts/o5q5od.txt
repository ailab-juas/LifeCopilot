YSK local police or Fire/EMS will do a health and safety check on a loved one if you’re worried that they may have died.

Why YSK: recently read a post detailing how devastated a family was after checking on a loved one they hadn’t heard from for several days, these traumatic experiences can do decades of damage to families. Utilizing local emergency services to do the check can save families from the extensive trauma of seeing someone after they’ve passed. This of course also applies to suicides and OD’s, as those scenes can also be very traumatic. Please do not let guilt or concern cause you decades of mental anguish, or ruin your last good memories of a loved one.
