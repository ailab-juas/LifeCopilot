LPT: Never make someone a priority for whom you are only an alternative.

content:
If they don't return your calls, don't call them or return theirs. If they can't be bothered to meet up, don't force it.

There are plenty of people out there who would love your company and you just don't know it yet. Don't waste your time on those who don't appreciate you.

EDIT: Obligatory "Fuck Scorpions" -- killed 2 last night and snapped it out.

EDIT2: Some people are saying that this is dumb advice, that everyone already knows it, but I think Angela Lansbury said it best: http://i.imgur.com/bgoN3hl.gifv

EDIT3: Removed by mods who are clearly scorpion sympathizers.

EDIT4: Added back by a mod who also clearly hates scorpions. REPRESENT!
