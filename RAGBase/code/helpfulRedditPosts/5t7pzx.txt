title:
YSK that there is no such thing as "could of". The proper term is "could have"

content:
This really gets my goat. It's simple English and yet people (Americans?) get it wrong all the time. I suspect it comes from a misapprehension when people say "Could've". Those who hear it assume it's "could of" and not a contraction of "could have".
