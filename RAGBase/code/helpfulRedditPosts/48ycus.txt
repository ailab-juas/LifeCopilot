LPT: Ask dog owners before petting dogs in public

content:
Please ask owners before immediately reaching down to pet dogs. I have a very sweet and shy rescue dog who is slowly becoming socialized. She isn't mean by any stretch of the word, but you have to approach her slowly as to not scare her. Not every dog is a droopy yellow lab that wants to drool all over you. You also have no idea if any of the dogs have history of aggression, if they have vaccinations, and even non-aggressive dogs can get scared. Remember, they're still animals, and while I'm sure you're probably a dog expert, please just ask!
