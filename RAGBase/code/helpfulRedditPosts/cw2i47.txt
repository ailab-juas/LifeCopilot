LPT: If you are bad at budgeting - always take out enough money for a week of food when you get paid. Hide it somewhere and don’t touch it. Then if you run out of money the week before payday you are able to feed yourself. If you don’t - it can go towards savings.

Edit : wow my dudes - I did not expect this to be so controversial I’ve just tried it recently and it helped me. 

A couple of things:
1. iF yOuRE bAd aT buDgEtING yOUrE DuMB - super helpful critique thanks

2. Yes - it means it’s still available to you - and it will still be even if you put it in another account. I find having solid cash helps me because I can see it disappear as opposed to just using a card. 

3. My point in a nutshell is (what I thought)  an interesting/alternative way to make sure you have money left over at the end of the month. It can also help budgeting if you see less money in your account to begin with. 

4. MOST IMPORTANTLY - I literally have no idea what the best budgeting style is for you so if this is going to leave you on the streets (as some commenters are acting like it will) don’t do it. Okay? Cool beans. 

Stay classy San Diego
