LPT: If it’s only a matter of +/- $10 or so, always book directly with the hotel or resort versus third party booking sites...

content:
Sure, if you’re going to save a tremendous amount of money through hotels.com or something similar, then go for it. But far too often you are treated like a second-class citizen when you show up with a third-party booking. It has happened to me several times, and I have witnessed it many many times. If there are problems, they always try to make you go back and deal with the booking agency, who then in turn tell you that it’s a hotel issue. It’s a merry-go-round that you definitely don’t want to be on. Also, you are much less likely to be accommodated with perks and upgrades if you did not book directly. I have learned this the hard way on a couple of occasions and have finally learned my lesson. It’s not worth it for a few bucks savings...
