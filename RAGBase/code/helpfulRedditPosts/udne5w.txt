LPT: don’t wait for a buddy to go with you, do things solo!

content:
Missed way too many good events in my younger days because I didn’t have someone to go with. Finally got sick of missing out and started attending things solo and it was the best decision I made. I have so much fun, almost always run into a friend or make a new one, don’t have to wait on anyone, stay with a group, and can leave whenever I’m ready!
