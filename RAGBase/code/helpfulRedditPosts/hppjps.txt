YSK that purple flowers are the most attractive colour of flower to bees, so if you want to attract more bees to your garden, pick out some pretty purple violets or lavender. üêù

My dad taught me this. His garden gets a lot of visitors :)

EDIT: as many commenters are pointing out, this does not apply to all species of bees. 
My intent was not to make a generalised claim, I never said to *only* plant purple flowers because *all* bees like them. 
I meant that it might help to plant some purple flowers if you like bees and want them in your garden.
