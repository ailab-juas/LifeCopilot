LPT: If someone is in the way of your perfect shot, ask them to take the picture.

content:
I was at an event yesterday and wanted to get a picture in front of a particular backdrop, but a couple of guys had parked themselves right in front of it and clearly weren’t planning on moving. I thought asking them to move out of the way would be rude, but I didn’t want to miss the shot as this would probably be my only opportunity, so I asked them if they would get a picture of me. They were happy to do so, and then I offered to take their picture afterward. It turned what could have been a really awkward situation into a friendly exchange that worked out better for all of us. I thought I’d leave this here in case it might help anyone out!
