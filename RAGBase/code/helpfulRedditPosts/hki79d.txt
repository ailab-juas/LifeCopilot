YSK that there is NEVER only one deer.

content:
Never, ever ever. 

If you're driving at night and just saw a single deer cross the road at the edge of your headlights? SLOW DOWN ANYWAY. Slow to a crawl, if it's safe to do so. A second deer is nearby and will follow it across, every time. 

I've driven on rural Midwest highways my entire life. Just yesterday, for the first time ever, I actually saw a lone deer. But that's not the norm, and that's how they getcha.
