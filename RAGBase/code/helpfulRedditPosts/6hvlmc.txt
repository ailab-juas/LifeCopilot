LPT: Try foods that you hated as a kid, your taste buds change every 7 years and you're very likely to enjoy most of the foods you disliked.

Most people are aware of this, and while I still dislike the smell of most of these foods, they taste delicious to me now. Don't just smell and dismiss them.  I disliked brusle sprouts, apricots, dried fruit, etc, and now in my early 30's I recently tried and love all of those things.
