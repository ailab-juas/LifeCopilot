LPT: No matter how small an item is, please consider donating them or putting them on Craigslist for a week before you throw it away, also there's a section on Craigslist for free stuff.

For example, I just moved 2,000 miles for a new job. I brought only what I could fit in my car.  You have no idea how expensive it is to furnish an apartment from scratch, even when buying things at Goodwill.  I've been checking Craigslist every other day and rarely find things I can use, but at the same time I keep seeing things out on the curb for the trash that I could've used if only they hadn't put it out in the rain.  I check both the Craigslist free section as well as the section where people are selling items, and it's like people want 2-3x what an item is worth and when they don't get that they just put it in the trash.
