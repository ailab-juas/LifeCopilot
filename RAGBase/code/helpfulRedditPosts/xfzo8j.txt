LPT For those frustrated by Youtube's new ad testing, the best thing you can do is to browse away or close your browser and not watch those ads. Google is a data heavy organization and if they don't see a significant reduction in people watching ads, they'll roll out platform wide.

Yes ad blockers can be valuable, however I would imagine a huge percentage of Youtube's audience doesn't use them. The best thing you can do is show your feelings through data by not watching those ads.
