LPT: The first six digits of a UPS tracking number after 1Z = the shipper's account number, if you need to return at shipper's expense.

content:
We are a small business with a UPS account. Work is shipped in, processed, and shipped back at customer's expense. Especially with new customers, we don't always have UPS information on-hand. Having UPS charge the customer directly for shipping saves us from incurring the cost and having to add it to the customer's invoice and generally simplifies things. Great for returns.

Note: This is not a huge secret, but it's helpful knowledge. Obviously what you charge to another UPS account will show on their bill that your account added those charges. Make sure it's known *beforehand* that the receiver (or third party) understands that they will be assuming shipping charges.

Tracking number looks like this:

**TRACKING #: 1Z XXX XXX YY ZZZZ ZZZC**

* X = Shipper's Account # (6 Digits)
* Y = Service Code (2 Digits) (See Partial Key Below)
* Z = Shipper's Reference # (Can be set by shipper for convenience, to mirror an invoice#, etc.)
* C = Check Digit
