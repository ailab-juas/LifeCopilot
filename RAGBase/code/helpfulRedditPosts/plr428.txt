LPT: If you've had Covid and your sense of smell hasn't fully returned...get a natural gas detector for your home. With cooler weather coming, you don't want to have a gas leak that you can't smell.

EDIT: For everyone saying "Get vaccinated and you don't have to worry about it"...I was fully vaccinated in April...got a breakthrough case that floored me. I understand what you're saying, but there are far more respectful ways to say it. The world needs people to be more compassionate now and less judgemental. Let's not forget that many people had covid before there was even a vaccine to get.
