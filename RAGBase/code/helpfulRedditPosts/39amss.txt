YSK that Cond√© Nast began this year to strongly support sponsored content (corporate advertisement disguised as original content)

content:
As cited [here](http://www.foliomag.com/2015/conde-nast-launches-sponsored-content-group/). We should be aware that more and more of the OC and homegrown content we see on this and other sites may in fact be corporate-sponsored advertising material. If it's a normal story, comment, video or image but with specific, conspicuous product placement, it might be advertising. Be wary!
