LPT: When you take a coffee order for colleagues/friends note their preferences on their contact in your phone or in a note-taking app. Next time you can be more efficient and surprise them with the correct order.

I will randomly get coffee for my team when I have time in the morning.  Doing this means I don't have to call ahead and ask them and they seem to appreciate it a lot more when I walk in with the correct order vs when they are expecting it.

I personally use evernote to keep track of stuff like this so that it's all in one place but using the "note" section in their contact info works well too.
