title:
YSK that the vast majority of human deaths (~92%) are caused by diseases, so statistically speaking you have a very very very low chance of dying from something other than a disease.

Stats are taken from: World Health Organization and [https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)  


I posted this info to help increase awareness of how important medical research is.  


P.S.   
Sorry for the exaggeration ("very very very"), I meant to highlight the unlikeliness of dying from any separate event not related to a disease at all (each one of those events included in that remaining 8%)
