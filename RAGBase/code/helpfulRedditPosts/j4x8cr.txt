LPT: Keep all the subs related to mental health in a second account. Having your home filled with posts about anxiety, depression etc. may remind you to go back or to simply think about it.

I am in a lot of subs about my mental health or issues I'm trying to solve. They're great, helpful and always there. Though, when it rarely happens that I am feeling better, I end up with a post which triggers me and reminds me of something. Then I think about it all day and that day where I actually was feeling better ends up being just another day. 

With this I'm not saying to not be in there anymore. There were days where they were vital to me. But if you suffer from any of those problems, you'll probably agree with me that sometimes it's just better to leave it alone, if it helps.

Edit: Read so many times so many edits of people who didnâ€™t expect their posts to blow. Now I get it. Thank you so much.
