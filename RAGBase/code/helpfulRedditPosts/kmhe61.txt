LPT: If a company offers you a temporary position with the potential for a full-time position at the end of your agreed-upon time of temporary work, then ask them for the details of the full-time position. At that point you can tell whether or not there really is a full-time position available.

So I just spent the last two and a half months working for a company as seasonal labor. Customer service during the busy time of the year. Over the past couple months all 13 people who were hired as seasonal have been told that 3 full-time positions would be given out to those with the best performance.

Now that the the date for our temporary position is two days away they have sent emails to people informing them of whether or not they received a position. the email stated that there was only a limited number of full-time positions and unfortunately you were not the one chosen.. As if they thought we would not talk amongst ourselves we found out that all 13 people were told the same thing.

In other words there were no full-time positions.

One person in our group was the smart one. When they got hired on they asked to see details of pay, benefits and the likely schedule of the potential full-time position. The job recruiter could not provide this at all. She said that they dodged this question multiple times and she knew right then and there that there would be no full-time positions given to anyone. Because the position did not exist.

So from now on when I get hired on a temporary basis with an expectation that it can lead to a full-time position I will be asking for the details of that potential job and you should too.
