title:
LPT: If you are complimented for doing a good job at something or your cooking, or really anything else, simply say thank you.

content:
It can be hard to do but don't diminish yourself, or especially the person who is complimenting you by explaining it away. Don't tell them how easy it is to do, or give credit to the technique your learned from someone else.

Smile and say thank you, and stop talking.

They deserve to have their gratitude received, and you deserve the credit for being awesome at something.
