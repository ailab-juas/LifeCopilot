LPT: If you have an Android phone, go to the developer options and set Animation Time to x0.5! Your phone will feel like it's gotten a huge processor update.

content:
Unlock Developer Options:

Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; 7x tap on Build Number


Decrease animation time:

Settings &gt; System &gt; Developer Options &gt; Set all Options with Animation Scale to x0.5 or less

Enjoy your fast phone

Edit: Wow, my first gold, thanks a lot! Glad you guys like the LPT :)

Edit Edit: As others have pointed out, Build Number in Samsung phones is apparently in About Phone &gt; Software info. Also this works on Android devices other than phones.

Edit Edit Edit: The exact options to tweak in Developer options are called Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale. Alternatively you can also turn the animations off via System &gt; Accessibility &gt; Remove animations!
