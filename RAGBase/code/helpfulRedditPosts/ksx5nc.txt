YSK: If someone commits a trivial mistake in their English, it’s not a big deal and doesn’t form the basis to invalidate their point

Why YSK: People often ridicule the grammatical or other mistakes in people’s English to invalidate their point. Chances are they noticed it too and simply don’t care. Their point still stands stall if it’s coherent enough, anyone going out of the way to comment on their mistake is either losing the argument or are too immature to engage in one.

It’s very common in the Indian subcontinent.

Edit: About time I made an edit to have my final say and leave. I personally love English and it's not even my mother tongue. It is, for me, the most beautiful language ever and I want to be as good at it as I can. I made this post because a lot of non-native speakers out there are *ridiculed* everyday for bad, incorrect English. While it is important to speak the language you're speaking as correctly as possible, for some it may not matter so much because they don't need it anywhere in their life. Also, one should always look for when is one helpfully correcting your mistakes so you may learn and appreciate them. Enough preaching. Over and out.
