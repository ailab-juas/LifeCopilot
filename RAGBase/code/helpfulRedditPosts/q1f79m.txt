title:
LPT If a coworker tells you they have a day off. Don’t follow up with “what for?” or “I’m jealous.” A day off is personal. If they want to tell you why, that is their choice. Better response would be “thanks for letting me know. We will take care of things while you are gone.”

A few years ago my uncle died and I had to travel for his funeral. And my coworker goes “just heard you’re off Friday. Lucky!” And I responded for my uncles funeral. And he apologized profusely. I accepted his apology. I was close with my uncle and I was not in a good mood. Of course I would love to take a day off for a good thing but sometimes that’s not the case. Recently my coworker said she was going to have a day off work. And another coworker said, “jealous,” she responded with I have to go to the doctor. We just don’t know what someone is going through. Sometimes taking a day off is for something more than going on a pleasant trip.
