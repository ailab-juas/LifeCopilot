LPT- if you live in a city and like thrift stores, don’t go to the Goodwill closest to you, go to the Goodwill closest to the wealthier neighborhoods.

I don’t know for sure this holds up everywhere but where I live the Goodwill near the wealthier part of town seems distinctly better as far as the quality of the clothes and furniture. I think a lot of the donations they receive go right into the shelves so you’re buying better brands, often donated in pristine condition.
