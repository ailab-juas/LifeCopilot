LPT: Never stop listening to new music

content:
Tonight I'm (44m) reflecting on my father (67m) and how he basically stopped listening to new music sometime in the mid 1970s. While he may have listened to the new albums from his favorite musicians, he never listened to new musicians or new genres.

My tip is simple: never stop listening to new musicians who create music in your favorite genre. Also, never be afraid to listen to new genres that you may not have heard before. 

There are tons of great musicians out there making tons of great music and so many people don't bother listening to this new music because they are stuck in the ruts of their old favorites. Trust me, listen to new music every chance to get. You would be amazed at how much great stuff is out there.
