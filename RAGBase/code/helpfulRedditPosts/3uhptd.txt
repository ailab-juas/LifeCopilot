LPT: Tape the Hex/Allen keys that come with furniture to the bottom of them

content:
Have done this for years. Those Hex keys you get with furniture always go missing.

Edit - A zip lock back containing the instructions &amp; spare screws also seems like a good idea. As people have said, a organized/full toolbox is just as good. If you have a family like mine who don't put things back or tend to misplace things yourself, this might be helpful.
