title:
YSK that an 11 digit password that consists of just letters is over 100 times more secure than an 8 digit password with letters, numbers, and characters.

content:
It takes about 57 days for a computer to figure out your password if it’s 8 digits and has numbers, letters and characters. On the other side, it takes 16 years for a computer to crack an 11 digit password that consists of just letters.

For other options:

A 9 digit password with everything takes a computer 12 years

Jumping from an 11 digit password to a 12 digit password that’s just letters gives you 600 years before a computer cracks your case.
