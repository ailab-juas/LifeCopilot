YSK that, your pupils should be the same size, even if light is shone in only one of your eyes.

content:
This is due to the pupillary light reflex. A difference in the size of someone's pupils is known as anisocoria. Causes of anisocoria can range from being physiologically normal to immediately life threatening.
If you notice a sudden, unexplained, or persistent difference in your pupil size you should seek the professional advice of a doctor (which I am not).
The number of people in the comments section of the front page post (linked in a comment) that thought pupils constrict independently of each other is way to high.
