YSK you shouldn’t take puppies under 4 months old to a dog park.

Why YSK: it is dangerous for young puppies to go to a dog park because it’s highly likely for them to contract a disease. 

This comes from the last 3 times I went to my local dog park there being not only tiny puppies under 2 months old there, but they were in the pen for dogs over 20 pounds. There is a sign of rules (no dogs under 4 months, no dogs that aren’t fixed, etc) which people regularly ignore. It’s usually not a huge deal, you know maybe once in a blue moon someone brings in an intact male and when he starts getting humpy or rude they leave pretty quickly. 

But these tiny puppies? Look, I get it, you want your puppy to like dogs. You wanna get them socialized. But dog parks are an actual cesspool of disease for unvaccinated dogs- and I say unvacced because puppies don’t get their final round of shots till they’re 3 months old, and it’s usually advised to wait another month for the vaccines to set in before allowing them into an area where lots of other dogs are. Hence the 4 month rule at the park. 

It’s a great place for your puppy to contract parvo, distemper, kennel cough, and whatever the heck else other dogs may carry. My own dog (10 months) got conjunctivitis from the dog park like 3 weeks ago. Some of these diseases are extremely DEADLY for little puppies. And trust me, I see a lot of small puppies come in at work for these things during spring and summer because their owner took them to parks too early. 

It’s just like how you wouldn’t let a brand new human baby lick a toilet in an elementary school. (And I say lick the toilet because puppies lick the ground, other dogs, people, poop, whatever).
