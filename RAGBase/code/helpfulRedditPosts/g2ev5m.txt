LPT: If you're thinking about buying something online, put it in your basket and then wait one day. Lots of online retailers will send you a 10% discount to complete the transaction

I've done this a few times. If I'm not sure abut buying something I put it in my basket and then think about it for a while. Often retailers will send you a discount code which can be tempting.

You will need to have entered your email address â€“ so progressed a step or two through the payment process, but not all the way.
