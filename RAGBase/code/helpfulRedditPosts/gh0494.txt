YSK that if the driver is asleep, the accident will probably be caused by the abrupt gestures he will do when waking up. If you see that the driver is asleep, the best thing to do is to remain calm, firmly hold the wheel with one hand and gently wake him up with the other one.

I had a car crash after falling asleep behind the wheel. Since then, I talked with truck drivers and heard other stories close to mine and everytime, the same conclusion came up : stay calm, so will the driver.
