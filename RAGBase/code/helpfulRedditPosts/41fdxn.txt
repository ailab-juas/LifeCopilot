YSK: USPS Shipping Rates are increasing today.

content:
most, if not all USPS postal rates have gone up with almost no mention of it anywhere. Full details [HERE](http://blog.stamps.com/2015/10/22/usps-announces-postage-rate-increase-starts-january-17-2016/) or [HERE](https://www.pexpeppers.com/usps-rate-2016-increases/)

We all get stuff shipped to us from time to time, so it sucks that the rates are going up.
Summary:

* The average shipping price rises 9.5% from $5.02 to $5.50.
* Priority Mail rises an average of 9.8%.
* Priority Mail Express rises an average of 15.6%.
* The USPS discontinues Priority Mail Express Flat Rate boxes.
* First-Class Package Service (a.k.a. First-Class Mail Parcel) rises an average of 12.8%. But there is good news after January 17:  The maximum weight for First-Class Package increases from 12.99 oz to 15.99 oz. Also, the rate for First-Class Packages under 8 oz. is a flat $2.60, which simplifies lightweight package pricing.
* Standard Post is now called Retail Ground, with an average increase of 10%.
