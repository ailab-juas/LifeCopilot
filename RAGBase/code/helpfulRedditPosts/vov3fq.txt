LPT: no matter what you're current circumstances are, you should have a personal "bug out" bag.

content:
Maybe your best friend invites you to a great party, or maybe your relative has a medical emergency. Perhaps your car breaks down, or your house catches fire. There's too many reasons to list why you should always have a bag tailored to your needs with all the essentials.

Some things worthwhile to have in it are sweet or savory snacks, a phone charger, socks, underwear, toiletries, first aid, any prescription medications, cash *and* visa gift card, so on and so forth. This is not a conclusive list by any means.
