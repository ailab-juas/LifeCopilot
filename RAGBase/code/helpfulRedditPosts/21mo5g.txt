LPT: Another grammar tip: Who=He, Whom=Him

content:
I posted this a while ago, and when I saw the other grammar post (I vs. me), I decided to post this.

I'm not 100% sure this works every time, but I know it works at least most of the time.

Here's what I remember: **Who = He, Whom = Him**

**Who** took the trash out? **He** took the trash out. 

To **Whom** is this letter addressed? The letter is addressed to **him**.

This is a good rule of thumb. If any grammar experts want to make a point, reply or send me a message and I'll edit this post.

EDIT: I see that some people are getting a little confused.

You don't say "To whom is the letter addressed? To him is the letter addressed."

This tip only deals with deciding who vs. whom; you must still change word order.
