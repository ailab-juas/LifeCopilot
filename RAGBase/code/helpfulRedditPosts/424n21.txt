LPT: You need to know the wonders of vinegar.

content:
I've seen too many people not know the magical properties of vinegar and that it is a gift from the gods. I know you have some in your house, don't know where you got it from or why you bought it, so let me help you out.

~~**You decided to go outside without sunscreen** and burnt yourself to a crisp. Vinegar. Pour vinegar on yourself or put it in a spray bottle and squirt yourself with it - it takes away the sting and you won't feel burnt.~~ This doesn't work for everyone, I've learned. It might work for you, but test it or just use aloe. I've always used it for relief after learning about it from working in the south.

**Have an animal that is an asshole and likes to pee on your laundry?** Throw half a cup or a cup of vinegar in the wash. Boom. Smell is gone and you get to keep your clothes.

**Hard water stains on your toilet or bath tub?** Soak paper towels in vinegar and leave it on the area for like an hour. Probably less, but I usually end up doing other stuff.

**Have hard water stains on your clothes because you're too cheap to buy water softener or just have crappy water?** Wash your clothes with vinegar. 

**Got bit by a mosquito and you're itching like crazy?** Vinegar.

**Have a sticker stuck on something like your car?** Soak some vinegar on there and it will peel off easy.

Vinegar is life.

**EDIT**: All of these are white distilled vinegar.
