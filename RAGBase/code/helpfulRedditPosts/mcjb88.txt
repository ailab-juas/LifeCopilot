title:
YSK that a ton of quiet , well behaved children, grow up to have anxiety and depression. Pay attention to the kids in your life who seem perfectly fine.

Why YSK: I was one of those kids. I didn't throw tantrums, I didn't complain, I was quite and polite; a "perfect" child. Now I and many others who used to be like me have found ourselves to be depressed and anxious as adults. As far as what is the exact reasoning for that correlation , I'm not entirely sure. A safe assumption is that my lack of demand for attention meant I just never got it. If a kid in your life causes you no issues or headache, make sure to acknowledge them still. Don't use that as an opportunity to push them to the side and focus on other kids who are more needy.

Edit: Can't believe I have to say this but, obviously not all quiet well behaved kids are destined to grow up depressed and anxious. I said a lot do. My point is that often these types of kids fall through the cracks and are not paid attention to. Their reward for not causing a scene is being ignored. That or these kids are living in less than ideal situations and people assume that because they are well behaved, that they are handling it just fine.
