LPT: For teachers, parents, and people that work with children and teens, explicitly teach them how to argue/discuss with adults and others. Don't tell them to not talk back.

A little background first. I grew up in an old school household where kids weren't allowed to talk back. We never talked about serious things, and consequently, as adults, we have a hard time talking to each other and disagreeing without people getting defensive and walking away. I also didn't know how to stand up for myself because I was never allowed to voice my opinion. Because of this, I stayed in abusive situations a little too long. It wasn't until I met my wife, who came from a talkative family, that I learned how to communicate better and voice my side of things. 

In my classroom and with my own kids, I tell them that I want them to argue with me and that I will teach them how to have a respectful discussion. This helps with students that feel like they have no voice/power in their families, and aren't allowed to voice their issues. I rarely have any "talking back" behavior issues in my middle school class because of this and students feel respected and heard. I do a lot of rewinding with students so they get to practice good discussion skills. 

I talk to them like how I expect to be spoken to - like an adult. A lot of parents and teachers yell and disrespect their students/children. This is not how we would expect to be treated, nor would we do this in a professional environment.
