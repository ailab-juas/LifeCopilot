YSK If You're A Homeless Youth In The US, Many Colleges Will Cover The Entire Cost If You Are Admitted.

content:
Many homeless students are not aware that there are resources available to them through the US Department of Education.  The link below contains a great guide to financial aid for homeless youths.  If you are homeless, you will be considered independent meaning your ability to pay for college will be based on your own income and assets and not your parents'.  This likely means that you will not be expected to pay anything for college and will be eligible for the maximum amount of aid your college offers.
