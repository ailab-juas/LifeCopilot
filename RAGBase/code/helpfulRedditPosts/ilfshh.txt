YSK: If your company only gives an annual raise of 1%-3% based on performance, that doesn't cover the historical inflation rate of 3.22%. You only get a true raise if your wages increase more than that.

Why YSK: If your raise is less than about 3.22%, then you'll have less buying power next year than you did this year. This information can be helpful when negotiating a raise, as you can use it as a tactic to say, "historically, 3% barely covers inflation."
