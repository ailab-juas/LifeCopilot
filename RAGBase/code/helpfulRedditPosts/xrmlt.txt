How to tell if eggs are ok to eat, regardless of the best before dated printed on the carton

content:
Take a bowl and fill it with cold water. Place the suspicious egg in the water. If it floats to the top of the water, this means quite a bit of gas has accumulated inside the egg and it's not a good idea to eat it.

Using this method, I have successfully enjoyed store bought eggs up to two weeks past the date on the carton.

I hope my fellow redditors appreciate what I believe to be an eggsellent LPT.
