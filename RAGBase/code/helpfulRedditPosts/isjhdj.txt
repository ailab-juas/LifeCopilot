YSK: Movies and TV shows misrepresent drowning. In reality, most often there is no splashing or shouting, actual drowning is silent.

Why YSK: Being able to recognize the actual signs of drowning will enable you to recognize when someone might be in dire need of help. If everyone would learn, we could maybe prevent a few drowning deaths.

As commentators have pointed out, please note that people obviously react differently and shouting for help/actual signs of distress shouldn't be ignored either. Also, only get in the water yourself to help if you are **certain** you are capable to do so! Getting yourself into a dangerous situation without proper training can lead to serious injury. Panicked swimmers will also instinctively grab at you and might pull you under as well, so be careful. If in doubt, seek help by a professional/life guard!

People drowning will often not wave at others to get help, will not shout and will not splash around a lot, especially younger children or if they have been exhausted by prior efforts to save themselves. Typical signs of a person drowning and in dire need of help are:

* Head tilted back
* Mouth at water level, probably dipping below surface at times &amp; repeatedly
* No shouting or waving, instead arms are spread out laterally or sometimes looking like they are trying to climb a ladder/grasping at nothing
* Body is in vertical position in the water
* Eyes appear glassy/empty

All of this especially applies to toddlers, who will just sink like a stone when falling into water - due to their diving reflex, which basically makes them hold their breath and not move.You can read more about all of this here: [https://www.thepragmaticparent.com/quick-silent-deadly-know-5-signs-drowning/](https://www.thepragmaticparent.com/quick-silent-deadly-know-5-signs-drowning/) or just google "silent drowning", there is a lot of info out there.  


Further info: If someone is just floating lifelessly in the water (especially head down) get them out asap as well. 

  
If you or someone else has almost drowned, ALWAYS go to the hospital, even if you or them seem fine. There are secondary, potentially deadly health concerns connected to almost drowning that absolutely need to be checked by a medical professional.

\[EDIT: Updated post to include "climbing ladder movement" as mentioned by two commentators\]  
\[EDIT 2: Thanks for the awards and upvotes, everyone. I never thought this would blow up this much. I have edited the post, since a few commentators have pointed out a few key things I think are wort mentioning. If you want to know more, I also recommend reading up about the subject, a good starting point may be Wikipedia, as always: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning) \]
