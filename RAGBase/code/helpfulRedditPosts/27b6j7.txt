LPT: If you have to pay a company to work for them, it's a scam. Walk away.

content:
MLMs fall into this category (Vemma, Amway, Mary Kay, Herbalife, etc.) as well as clothes stores ~~like A+F, Hollister, etc.~~ that require you to buy their clothes to work there.

Edit: Sorry, you're NOT required to buy A+F and Hollister clothes. I had heard otherwise from a few friends who worked at those stores 10+ years ago. I guess they changed their policies. 

Also, it appears that some of you don't quite understand what I mean. Of course, it's normal and acceptable to pay for business clothes, gas to get to work, rent space, buy tools, etc. I'm talking about companies that make you pay THEM. For example, stores that make you buy their clothes ONLY (and they're usually pricey shit) and wear them in order to be able to work there, and MLM companies that make you pay them upfront (a $200 starter package, for instance), constantly buy their products in order to sell them, or pay a monthly "membership" fee.
