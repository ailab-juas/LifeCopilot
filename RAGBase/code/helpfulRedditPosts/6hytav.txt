LPT: When studying keep a blank page by your side.

LPT: Whenever you're studying, you can greatly reduce the chances of you being distracted by having a blank page by your side. Write down whatever thoughts occur to you on that page and assure yourself that you will search/work on them later. Often we leave study because we think a matter is important to not be dealt with immediately. This LPT makes sure you keep on studying.
