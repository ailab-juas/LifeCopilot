YSK the FCC will now take your net neutrality complaints

content:
The core net neutrality rules prohibit blocking or throttling of lawful content, or "paid prioritization," in which online content providers pay for faster access to consumers.

The Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules took effect today, and you can file complaints against your Internet service provider (or mobile data provider) on the FCC's website @ https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824
