LPT: Do not mix cotton with super glue. It can catch fire.

content:
I was trying to fix one of my shoes with a small dot of super glue when all of a sudden it got hot and started smoking. A quick Google search later, and it turns out that cotton and super glue create a chemical reaction that creates heat and fire. I feel this should be more well known, since both are extremely common household items and they spontaneously combust when mixed together. If you need to start a fire, like in a survival situation, you can start a fire quickly and easily with these.
