LPT: Ever need another email address but don't want to register an whole new account? If you add a "+1", "+2", etc. before the @ in your email address, websites will register it as a new email, but still send mail to your normal address. Makes organizing accounts or endless free trials much easier!

content:
Example: Primary email: Bob@gmail*.*com

Modified emails (all go to the primary):

Bob+1@gmail*.*com

Bob+2@gmail*.*com

Bob+3@gmail*.*com

This can be used to endlessly register for free trials like Netflix.

No need to even sign into the new address because all the confirmation emails go straight to your normal account that you are already logged into.

Edit: Apparently you can add anything you want after the plus sign, so you can do Bob+netflix or bob+netflix1, or whatever! Thanks for the additional tip u/PM_ME_A_PLANE_TICKET
