LPT: If you struggle with time management, you may have what's called Time Blindness (the inability to sense the passing of time). Your biggest life-changing decision may be to begin using a Timer to commit short periods of time to certain tasks.

Using a timer will help you to become more aware of what others experience naturally: the sensation of time passing.

[This recent study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220420092150.htm) on the pupils of people with aphantasia (a different disorder - the inability to imagine) proved what millions afflicted with it have been saying since the 1800's: that they cannot visualize imagery with their mind's eye. For them, that eye is blind.

Similarly, time blindness is also a sensory impairment.

Basically, most people have a built-in "timer". People with time blindness do not.

It's been associated with ADHD, PTSD &amp; depression but can also occur independently of other conditions.

My life changed when I learned the term &amp; googled it.

Everything I'm learning, I'm compiling at [ObeyTheTimer.com](https://obeythetimer.com).

The site has an online timer &amp; simple success-tracking system (just checkmarks to record your progress). You can even order physical scorecards if you want. I use them &amp; it helps! You can also make your own.

I hope this helps someone!
