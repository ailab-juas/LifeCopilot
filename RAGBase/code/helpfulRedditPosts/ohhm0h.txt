LPT: When trying to cancel an internet/phone/localised subscription, tell them the reason for cancelling is you’re moving out of the country.

content:
I move around a lot and have never had to deal with pushy customer support reps because of this. They typically try to retain me as a customer but once they hear I’m moving to a country they don’t service it’s about another 3 minutes on the phone and the job is done. It’s not worth sharing any valid complaints or issues you have that are actually leading to the cancellation - save these for a feedback submission form that won’t hold your time hostage shoving packaged deals down your throat.
