YSK that letting your dog sniff on walks is very enriching, interesting, and stimulating for them. Your dog sniffing every little thing in the neighborhood is equivalent to us reading the newspaper; its how they absorb information, and will give you a calmer dog!

content:
Why YSK: Dogs learn about their surroundings through their noses. What dog has been here? What is this interesting smell emanating from this green bin? Oh is that what snails smell like? There is a great misconception about walking dogs, that owners think the enriching part of the walk is the act of walking itself, when in fact its the sniffing your dog gets to do!

Your dog gets the opportunity to think, learn, and satisfy an innate behaviour. Think of it this way, you get satisfaction by scrolling through reddit, but if someone made you sit too far away from the screen, and scrolled by things that appear to be potentially interesting, it wouldn't relax you, it would likely do the opposite!

Next time you're out with your dog, try giving them ample sniffing time, you'll likely end up with a happy, calmer pup!
