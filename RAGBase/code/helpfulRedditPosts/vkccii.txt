title:
LPT: If you’re picking up takeout, call the restaurant to order directly, rather than use a food ordering app. The restaurant will make more money because they won’t need to pay commissions for the app.

content:
Apps like Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Menulog can take a commission from the restaurant if you order through them, even if they’re not delivering it.

Order from the restaurant directly and you’ll help a small business keep more of their money and it will cost the same or even be slightly cheaper for you.
