YSK: Driving slow in the left lane is not only annoying but its also illegal in most states.

content:
Every state has a different fine amount for driving slow in the left lane or "impeding traffic." The left lane if for passing only. Even for people that are driving faster/speeding you are suppose to to change lanes after passing.

On top of this, It is a safety issue to be driving slow/the speed limit in the passing lane. People will have to switch out of the passing lane to pass you which is the exact opposite of what they should be doing. You might say "well they shouldn't be driving that fast." That true but ultimately not up to you to stop or change.
