title:
YSK don’t turn around and go back home after your dog has done its duty.

content:
The dog will begin to learn that you take it back home after it shits. And after they learn they’re going to hold their shit in for them to walk longer. So what you need to do is have a set path or two that you take and follow that path completely. This lets the dog know that they have a set amount of time for them to do their duty before they get back home.
