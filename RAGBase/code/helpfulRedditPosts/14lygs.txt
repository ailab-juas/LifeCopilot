LPT: Once you have tightly closed the lid on a can of paint, carefully hold the can upside down for a moment. This forms a thin coating on the inside of the lid that will dry into a tight seal, keeping the rest of the paint fresh for longer.

**UPDATE**: Read edits below before considering using this tip.

BONUS: Now with pro advice conveniently pasted below!

**Edit**: Lots of painters have added great additional tips, which include tips about opening and cleaning the can properly to begin with, which is half the battle. (Actually 100% the battle if you do it perfectly.) Thanks guys! Listen to them and you won't need this tip as much.

My use of this tip began in painting school, where the paint cans were shared by all of us, which meant that I  regularly came across cans that looked like they had been opened by a blind gorilla wielding a balisong, and cleaned by a single swipe of newspaper. This LPT was a good way to try to make the best out of a crusty ricrac rim.

**2nd EDIT**: It has been interesting reading replies from painting pros. My teacher had decades of experience from both painting and teaching when she taught us this tip, so I believed it at the time. However, so many painters have shared differing viewpoints that I have no other logical choice than to re-evaluate this LPT as bogus, as of today. 


**3rd EDIT** Some kind redditors have shared useful instrucction on opening and closing cans properly. They consented to me adding them here so people won't miss it and can use this info. Thanks guys.

&gt;keep the inside of your lid CLEAN, use a rage to wipe it off, when paint gets on there it dries, and the cap won't fit on.

&gt;To close it, I apply pressure to 2 opposite sides of the top, then the other sides. Just don't push one side too much.

&gt;After painting many houses, I just put the top on the clean lid, and step on it (I've gotten pretty good at it).

&gt;The trick is to use a painters tool, (5 in 1 tool), and work your way around the can evenly. Next best thing is a paint can opener or key that has the proper angled end. The worst thing you can do is try an open a can with a flat head screwdriver especially an old can. In that case you'd be better off using a knife like Crocodile Dundee.
