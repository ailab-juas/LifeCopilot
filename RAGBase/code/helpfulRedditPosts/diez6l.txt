LPT: If you find someone's wallet, bring it to their bank (check credit/debit cards). The bank will have their most updated contact info. The address on ID may not be the most updated.

I've lost my wallet a couple of times (not stolen since no activity on cards) but the person who found it can't contact me to let me know where it is :(

Even if the address on the ID is correct, most people won't wait long enough for postage before cancelling their cards.

EDIT: Sorry if this wasn't clear but I didn't mean that you should get the address of the person from the bank. I meant that the bank could call the owner of the wallet for you and let them know whats up.
