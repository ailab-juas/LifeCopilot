YSK If your credit card recently ended it's 0% APR promotion, call customer service and request to close your account. They will transfer to a specialist that will try to keep you and possibly will offer you 0% APR for another 12 months!

Before you do this on your own credit card, I should mention my credit card had $0 balance for a month now (not sure if it makes a difference, but I thought I should mention it). I called my credit card company (prefer not to disclose it publicly, but if you PM me then I will), and requested to close my account. They transferred me to their account specialist and told me they would extend the 0% APR for another 12 months. I decided to keep my credit card after getting this promotion.

Keep in mind, your mileage may vary. If they don't offer it, you can always bring it up to them and say that you will stay only if you give me another 0% APR for another 12 months and they might work with you to keep you with them!

Edit: I should have mentioned this before but this 0% APR promotion started the following day that I called in. So it doesn't work if you have an existing balance. As /u/craigeryjohn mentioned, it's possible you can stretch your current 0% APR if you talk to the credit card company, while I haven't done it, it is definitely worth a try!
