LPT: If you're feeling semi-ghosted by someone - slow response to overtures, unenthusiastic responses, weak/untrue excuses, etc - let them go. Don't confront them unless you're worried about them or you need to apologize. Likely, you're a low priority for them and it's best to go your separate ways.

People change, relationships change, or we just misjudge things from the beginning. 

Sometimes, someone who we thought was always going to be there for just isn't anymore, or who we thought was really into us seems to change their minds. It's a sad truth, but this happens all the time.

Having an angry confrontation over someone pulling away from you in a relationship rarely has positive outcomes. You can rarely talk, scold, yell, or guilt someone into being a better friend or more into you. (Obviously, I'm not talking about committed romantic relationships here, just friends, coworkers, dates, etc.)

Friendships can often be cyclical as well. Sometimes you feel closer to some people and sometimes others. This also happens in dating when people are seeing multiple people - they get into one person for a while, but then realize they prefer someone else.  Giving people their space when they cycle out with you leaves the door open for them to come back when they're ready. 

Lastly, this can also be a sign that your friend thinks you have become a toxic person in their life. Even if you absolutely haven't, if they think so then just let them go - they are the toxic one.
