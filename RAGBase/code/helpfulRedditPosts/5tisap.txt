LPT: If you ever get canned tuna packed in water, don't dump the fishy water down the drain. Instead, add it to some of your cats/dogs dry kibble and they will love you for it!

Holy smokes, I didn't think this many people would see this post! A few things:

For those of you who don't have pets, disregard this LPT and get back to your sad pet-free life. 

To all ye nay-sayers, I understand that you come from a good place. But I don't think 1 cans worth of tuna juice split between my 3 fur babies every once in a blue moon is going to send any of them to an early grave or give them some sort of eating disorder. So let's all simmer the fuck down. 

To everyone else, I loved hearing about your fur children! Thanks for taking the time to share!
