LPT: See if your town has a Restaurant Supply Store often you can get professional quality kitchen supplies significantly cheaper than their equivalent on most consumer stores or websites.

Generally, you are not required to be in the industry. We have a great one near us and we get all kinds of things from barware to big spoons,  storage containers, whisks, cutting boards, chef knives, even small appliances.  My wife's favorite is sheet pans for baking.  All of which are designed to survive in an industrial kitchen.  Therefore they will last close to indefinitely in a personal kitchen.
