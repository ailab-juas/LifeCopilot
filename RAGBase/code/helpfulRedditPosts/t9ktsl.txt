LPT During times of war, inflation, people have been encouraged to build themselves a small garden. This lowers a family's cost of food during the war, and prevents shortages. Having a victory garden in 2022 could be a great idea for your home, even an apartment, to lower the rising cost of food.

You should start a small garden. Even if you live in an apartment, a small garden can help lower your food bill, and relieve stress on the nations food transportation chain.

If you live in an apartment, you still can have an indoor garden. You place it in front of a sunny window.

This year could spell food prices, that some people will have to decide, to eat or to pay bills. This can help you do both, and food that grows in the garden nourishes you and is healthy. So grab a pot, plant a tomato vine, and watch it grow so you can enjoy the fruits of your labor :)

Edit: many people are missing the word "shortages". This LPT prevents shortages, as well as lowering costs. I highly doubt any redditors lived thru the last depression and war, but let me tell you, the government set rations. Rations do not apply to your home grown garden (or apartment balcony). So if you had a garden, or have a garden, you allow yourself to eat as you wish. I hope none of us ever live thru that, but you should always be prepared.
