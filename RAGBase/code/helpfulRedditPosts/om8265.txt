YSK: Thiamine deficiency is common among heavy drinkers and can present as confusion, hallucinations, unsteady gait, and abnormal behavior

Why YSK: It takes extra thiamine and folic acid to process alcohol, leading to deficiency if the individual does not supplement. Thiamine deficiency can progress to Wernickeâ€™s encephalopathy or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) which can be deadly and requires medical treatment. The treatment is thiamine supplementation. If left untreated it can lead to death or cause permanent neurological damage.
