YSK: You can freely and legally download the entire Wikipedia database

Why YSK: 
Imagine a scenario with prolonged internet outages, such as wars or natural disasters. Having access to Wikipedia(knowledge) in such scenarios could be extremely valuable and very useful. 

The full English Wikipedia *without images/media* is only around 20-30GB, so it can even fit on a flash drive.
