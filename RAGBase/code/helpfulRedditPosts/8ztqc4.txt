YSK that there is a YouTube videodeck that lets you manage your subscriptions like YouTube itself should do it.

Easy to use, just add your subscription (or custom playlists) as columns. You can sort them via drag and drop and change a bunch of view settings. Each column shows uploads chonologically and new uploads will show up automatically (push-behavior). 

It's free (with a few ads you won't see since you are most likely using a ad blocker) and I have used it for years and never even have been on my sub page on YouTube since I watch everything from there. Since the repeated outrage over how YouTube manages how videos show up to their users, I hope this is of use to some of you.
