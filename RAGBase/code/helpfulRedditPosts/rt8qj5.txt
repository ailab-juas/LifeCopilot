LPT: If a drinking buddy wants to quit drinking, give them your immediate and enthusiastic support.

content:
You'll never regret small acts of kindness, and this is an easy one. You care about your friends, so keep them healthy and safe by creating an environment where they find it easy to stay in control of their substance habits.

Edit to add:

Your script: "Good for you. What would help you do that?"

Then *listen.* This is related to "How can I help?" which is good, but centers your need for a task to do, not your friend's needs. "What would help you?" is a nudge to proceed from stating an intention to developing a concrete plan. When this planning produces things you can help with, pick em up and reinforce em. Momentum, baby.
