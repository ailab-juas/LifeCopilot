title:
LPT: Don't apologize for things that aren't your fault.

content:
When you apologize for something that isn't your fault, the other person tends to feel "retroactively entitled" to that apology, which creates the perception that the issue WAS your fault, and allows that person to avoid accountability for their own actions. Save the ~~words "I'm sorry"~~ apologies for when you, or someone/something that is your responsibility (kid, pet, employee, product), is actually the cause of the issue. Otherwise, just acknowledge the issue and dive right into finding a solution. 

EDIT: Edited to take the focus off the phrase "I'm sorry" because it's about the apology, not the words, and because "I'm sorry" can be used in other contexts such as expressions of compassion or condolence.

EDIT # 2: A lot of people seem to interpret this as me saying that you should never apologize and that you instead should justify your actions with no regard for how they affect others. This is NOT the intent. Apologize! Apologize often! Apologize even when something is only loosely your fault, or when you've miscommunicated! But DON'T apologize when you haven't done ANYTHING wrong, because you're just giving others the opportunity to walk all over you. **I AM SORRY** FOR MISCOMMUNICATING IN THIS THREAD!
