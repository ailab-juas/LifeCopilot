LPT: Don’t use fabric softener on sweat-wicking/performance wear. It clogs the fibers and materials with a waxy film, rendering the clothing’s purpose useless.

This includes those dryer sheets. That’s all I got, I ain’t no scientist

Edit: For those worried about clothes coming out static-y, the culprit might be that you’re putting your clothes in the dryer for too long or too high of heat. Try less heat or less time:)
