LPT: How to properly cook meat on a stainless steel pan

content:
Stainless steel pans are great to cook with if you know what you're doing. If you don't, you end up with a bunch of burnt meat stuck to your pan. The key is to heat your pan to the correct temperature before adding oil and adding your meat. 

There is a quick and easy test to see if your pan is hot enough. You heat your pan over medium heat until a small amount of water dropped onto the pan beads up and floats over the surface. It should not sizzle at all. It should look like a drop of mercury.

[Rouxbe](http://rouxbe.com/cooking-school/lessons/173-the-water-test-heating-the-pan) has a video showing you.

Once you have your pan hot enough, add your oil, but only enough to lightly cover the bottom of your pan. (I use 1-2 tbs in my skillets). Once your oil is just slightly smoking, add your meat.
