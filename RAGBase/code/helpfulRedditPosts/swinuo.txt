LPT: if you’re a dude that’s out and about and you have to take a dump. Hitting up a Michaels or Hobby Lobby will give you cleaner/more peaceful results.

Significantly less men shop these stores than say Home Depot or Wal-Mart.  So most likely the men’s room will be cleaner and you have a significantly less chance of an interloper walking in on you while you’re blowing out the bathroom.
