LPT: If you see rusty, busted Craftsman tools at a garage sale, grab them. They have a lifetime warranty. Bring them to Sears, they will throw the old ones in a bucket and let you grab a new ones off the shelf. No receipt, no questions asked.

I didn’t know about this policy until I worked at Sears in high school. People would bring in tools that looked like they were 30 years old and busted. We would just throw the tool in a bucket under the counter and let them grab a new one off the shelf. That easy.

Edit: I truly enjoyed being roasted about Sears disappearing. My hometown apparently has one of the very few still standing (for now). Like I said I worked there in high school and admittedly I haven’t tried this tip in a decade... or two. Damn, sorry guys, I wish Reddit was around in 1998. Try Lowe’s?
