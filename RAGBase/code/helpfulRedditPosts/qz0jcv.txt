LPT: Don’t take anything serious to HR if you have evidence, lawyer up instead

content:
HR doesn’t work for you, they work for them selves and the company. They will screw you over any chance possible. By providing evidence to HR of misdoings to you by the company, you are playing your hand and will likely get screwed over by any technicality they can find or be hushed up. Instead lawyer up and take them to court if it’s anything close to serious. Don’t trust HR to care about you, they only care about keeping their job and if that means disposing you, they will.
