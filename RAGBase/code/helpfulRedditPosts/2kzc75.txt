YSK how to relieve knotted muscles using a tennis ball

content:
I have a bad back, so I use this almost daily.  I usually do this by leaning against the wall, keeping the ball behind my back, under my shoulder blades then rolling onto my neck.  

The trick is to hold the ball with constant pressure on the most painful part of the knotted muscle until it releases. Sometimes this takes seconds, other times two minutes, but it will release, and it feels amazing when it does.
