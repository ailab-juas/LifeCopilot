YSK you can add "gaming." in any YouTube link to have a bigger and darker layout

content:
In the address bar, instead of "youtube.com" insert "gaming.youtube.com" then the rest of your link.

I noticed this a few days ago and it's great when you watch a lot of videos! The theater mode is a lot bigger than the regular one and the overall background is dark gray so it's easier on the eyes especially later at night.
