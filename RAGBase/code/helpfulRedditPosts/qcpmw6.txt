LPT: You should have a letter or something hidden that says how much care about your loved ones and how they make your life worth it in case anything ever happens to you

content:

Today reminded me of when my aunt died in a car accident 6 years ago. It was around Halloween, but I remember my cousin finding a series of letters my aunt wrote on New Years every year since moving into their house about her husband, her kids, her life, and how much she felt blessed to have all these things.

Guys, these letters talked about hard things like how it was ok to lose the ones you love (from when she lost her mom) and how whatever happens it was worth it to have those around her. It seriously made coping with the loss easier, because at the end of the day we could look at those and read her own words that say she felt her life has been worth it even if she wasn’t here tomorrow. That she loves us all no matter when, or what is happening. Funny thing is, I’m not even sure if they were meant for our eyes considering it had goals about money and weightloss thrown in there as well.

Irregardless, there’s serious power in that, you never know how life turns out. Oh, and If someone accidentally finds one early, for the love of god please don’t write these like a suicide note, more like an appreciation and “whatever happens, I love you all and you made life was worth it” type of letter.
