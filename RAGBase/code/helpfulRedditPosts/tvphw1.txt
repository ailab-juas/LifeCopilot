LPT Before you go on a trip, clean your room and organize things

If you are going on a trip, you are excited and while packing you can also clean the room. When you come back, you are a bit tired, you have clean everything, and you can relax.

Coming from a trip to an unclean and unorganized room might make it tougher to clean and organize the room.
