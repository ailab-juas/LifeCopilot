YSK Do not try to cheat anti-plagiarizing services with quotation marks.

content:
It absolutely will not work, the services people use these days are much more sophisticated than that. Please do not blindly trust LPTs people post on reddit.

TurnItIn, for instance, will also look up parts of your text that you have quoted, and make sure that your quotations are done properly, reporting these numbers separately.

If you somehow manage to scramble your text so it becomes unreadable for these tools (by messing with fonts, invisible symbols etc.) red flags will be raised both from a suspicious word count, as well as due to implausibly low literal match (usually scientific works should have a match around 10%).

TLDR: just do your fucking homework and don't trust people on the internet.
