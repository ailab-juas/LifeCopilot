LPT: After painting, take a picture of the lid(s) and email it to yourself with the room(s) you painted that color in.

If you need to touch up or buy more later on it will be easy to take back to the paint store to have replicated and not have to keep cans of old paint laying around.

Edit:
Example of what I'm talking about because people seem to think I'm talking about taking a picture of the paint color itself, which would be useless.
