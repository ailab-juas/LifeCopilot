LPT: Try to get into the habit of doing small tasks whenever you can by acknowledging the amount of time it will take. is there trash on your desk? It takes fifteen seconds to get up and throw it away. Your home life will be more comfortable if you get into the habit of doing this kind of stuff.

Reddit or video games can wait for thirty seconds while you get another glass of water, or blow your nose, or fix the crooked painting... seriously, if you're on Reddit for twelve hours, you can spend fifteen seconds to fix a small issue you have.

Or what about cleaning your PC? Nothing interesting happening? Well, you probably have some dumb shit on your PC taking up space that you'll never use and you can take like ten seconds to locate and delete.

You've got a lot of time to do productive things in a day. There's no reason why you can't take a variable-but-still-small amount of time out of your day to make your life better for the moment.
