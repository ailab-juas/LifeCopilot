LPT When speaking to non-native English speakers who struggle to understand you, speak slower, not louder.

content:
Do not raise your voice. It doesn't help. Not even a little bit. Instead, speak slowly. I mean it! Speak at a pace that feels a little annoying. SLOW DOWN. Pause briefly between words. Eunciate your consonants. Use simple grammar. Swap out synonyms: if "garbage" doesn't register, try "trash." If they don't know "bathroom," try "toilet." 

If you must resort to using Google translate, use very simple, short sentences, and use punctuation. Google translate is not as accurate as you probably think. 

Remember, learning a foreign language is very challenging for most people. English is one of the most difficult languages to learn. If you've never learned a foreign language, it's impossible to know what it feels like. It's mentally exhausting. Give the English learner some credit for what they do know. Be patient and kind. Much love.
