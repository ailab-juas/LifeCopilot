LPT: A single flower given unexpectedly, goes a lot further than expensive arrangements on expected holidays.

Edit: Wow I totally did not expect this gain so much traction. 

Edit 2: Obviously it doesn't have to be a flower. The idea is to let your SO know they still matter to you outside of when you're expected to. It goes for both men and women as well. 

The idea boils down to something I've heard off and on over the years. Never stop dating your SO. 

Also forgive me for my comma mistake. I get it no need to punish me further :].
