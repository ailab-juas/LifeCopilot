title:
LPT: If you arrive at the airport early and can’t find free parking while you wait, open Uber and check where on the map the drivers are parked waiting for a job.

content:
Uber drivers will often park within a 10 minute drive in a comfortable location that is free while they wait. You can see there will be a number of drivers in one location when you view the map in Uber.

Edit: Seems this is a shitty life pro tip if you live in the states. Don’t do this in the states as they have Uber specific lots and satellite lots for this purpose.

This doesn’t have to be for airports though, just any place that is busy and hard to find parking or places to stop.
