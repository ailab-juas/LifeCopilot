LPT: Never assume someone has plans on their birthday

content:
it’s quite possible they didn’t want to put on people by organising a celebration  I’ve been on both sides of this; I was bored on my friend’s birthday and it transpired she had been home alone too, and I’ve also seen my friends make spontaneous plans on my birthday and not invite me assuming I’ll be fully booked up with family. When you send your ‘happy birthday’ message, maybe just check in what their plans are for the day.
