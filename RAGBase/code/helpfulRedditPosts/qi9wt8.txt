title:
YSK that there are plenty of open courses to help you choose a degree or learn in general

content:
Why YSK: Getting a degree is one of the most serious decisions you make in life and determining if a course is right for you can be difficult. To help you decide, there are free online resources where you can actually see the kind of introductory lectures you'd take.

eg. you can search the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw) by subject (they have playlists) or a [whole list of other channels and websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/cktxy/reddit_lets_compile_a_list_of_the_best_online/) compiled by reddit (even if 10 years ago, haven't tried them all but the 5 I checked works fine).

edit: As u/falcoholic92 and u/Larnek pointed out, the specific degree isn't as important as having any degree except for a few fields (mainly STEM and medicine). Nonetheless, finding one that you'd find interesting and therefore easier is still an advantage.
