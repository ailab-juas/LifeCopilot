LPT: At the end of a job interview, always ask the interviewer when they expect to make a hiring decision and if they plan to contact the people who didn’t get the job.

Many interviewers are good at giving the impression you had a great interview. And then you hang on waiting for that call that never comes. If you know the timeline and know to expect a call if you didn’t get the job at least you know you can move on and look elsewhere.
