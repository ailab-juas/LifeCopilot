LPT: If your roommates' cell phone alarm is going off and they are not in the room, call the phone and it will disable the alarm.

Example: Roommate leaves to go shower and forgot to turn off the alarm

If you're too lazy to get up and turn it off manually this works great or if there is a passcode on it, this still will disable the alarm

YES- it was posted yesterday. I posted the same thing except there were errors on my part and a lot of misunderstanding so I deleted it and then posted it again today to try to be helpful.
