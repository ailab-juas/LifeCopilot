title:
YSK Craigslist has a “Free Stuff” subsection under the “For Sale” section where people post stuff that they are giving away.

content:
I have gotten free table saws, free drill presses, and basically a whole garage worth of free tools and parts and other stuff, mostly because people are moving and can’t take it all with them, or someone in the family died and the relatives are letting people come empty out the garage/basement/kitchen/etc…

Please post on there if you are getting rid of stuff that can be reused, or repaired, etc.

Why YSK: free stuff for you, or helping out others. Don’t waste, and don’t let things go to waste
