LPT - Put a QR Code for Your Home Wifi on Your Fridge

content:
Go to your wifi settings, Select your home network settings, Click Share, Screenshot then print that QR code and put it on your fridge. I don't have an apple device, but on android it's: Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Internet &gt; [MyHomeNetworkName] [Gear Icon] Settings &gt; Share


On behalf of anybody who ever visits your home again... thank you.
