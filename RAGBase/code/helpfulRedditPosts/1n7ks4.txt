YSK than Imgur has increased the file size limit for uploading gifs from 2MB to 5MB &amp; for pro accounts, 10MB

content:
Now you can spend more time creating high-quality images and less time fiddling with the optimization settings.  

*Evidence: [this Breaking Bad reaction gif I made](http://i.imgur.com/T1zndhf.gif) is 8.6 MB (unnecessary but just to show that it works)

The size limit and amount of compression for static images has also been greatly improved:

edit. 


**The gif above is just an example that I deliberately made longer because someone asked if the new limits were live. The original file size is much, much smaller.** 

Why you would need or want to make a 10 MB gif will be different depending on what you're trying to achieve. I don't want to be like that annoying relative who puts 10 layers of unnecessary holiday wrapping around your present.  I might make a great reaction gif but I don't want to annoy my audience with long download times.

OTOH, making a high-quality, looping gif of a relatively longer chemical reaction (for example) may have its benefits over simply linking to the middle a much longer video.
