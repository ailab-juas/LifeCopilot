title:
LPT: If the audio is out of sync with your video in VLC you can tweak the audio track manually by pressing F and G.

content:
Also, to tweak the subtitles you can press H and J.

Fullscreen is Command (âŒ˜) F.

Edit: As it turns out this is for the **Mac version** of VLC. 

**For Windows 7:**

F - Fullscreen

G,H- Subtitle sync

J,K-Audio Sync

(Thanks to glassfrog for pointing this out, amongst others.)

I don't see why they would change the hotkeys for different operating systems though.
