LPT: If you have an old picture of someone, give it to them.

content:
If you're like me, you have boxes or albums full of old photos and quite a few stored digitally. These pictures are just as precious (if not more so) to the people in them as they are to you. You wouldn't want them to go the rest of their lives without seeing them, would you?

This can be a daunting project, if you have a ton of photos, but it's very rewarding too. You can instantly make your friends' and family's faces light up as they see your photos and remember "the old days."

What you'll get in return is hearing old stories you've forgotten about (or never knew) and the appreciation of the people you've photographed over the years.

I hosted a party once and excused myself for a moment to dig up a couple old photos I had of two of the attendees. One of them brought his girlfriend and I showed it to her first. She had never seen a picture of her boyfriend that was more than a few years old. They were both elated.

I would suggest doing this privately (as opposed to randomly posting it on their Facebook wall, for example). Let them decide if it belongs on social media in order to avoid any potential embarrassment.

EDIT: Obviously, there will be some situations where this isn't appropriate. Always keep other people's feelings in mind in this and other situations. (Bonus LPT for ya.)
