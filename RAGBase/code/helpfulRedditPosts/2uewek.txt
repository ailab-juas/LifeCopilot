title:
LPT: Chill/Nearly Freeze an Orange to Make Peeling Easier and Eliminate Nearly All the Pith.

content:
Throw an orange in the freezer 10-15min before peeling (depending on your freezer).  This will stiffen the outside of the orange enough to make it easier to peel and eliminates nearly all the pith ("white stuff") that normally sticks to the orange. 

Simply score the outside with a knife and easily pull the peel off.
