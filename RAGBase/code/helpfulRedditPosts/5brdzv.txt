YSK: You can detect fake Amazon sales during the Holidays, by using browser addons

content:
Some Amazon sellers jack up the price of their products before the holidays to qualify as being "on sale" during the holidays.

You use browser addons to see price history for products and detect such price changes.  

Personally, I've found Keepa on Firefox to be useful, but others might know of better ones.
