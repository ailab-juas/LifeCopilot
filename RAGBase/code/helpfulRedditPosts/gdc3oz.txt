LPT: if you need dairy free recipes, check out Kosher ones. Kosher laws prohibit to have dairy and meat in the same meal, so most recipes are made without dairy products. Kosher restaurants that serve meat will be dairy free too.

Edit: as some people pointed out in the comments, not all recipes are dairy free. Look for recipes that include meat (fish doesn't count as meat here) or are marked **parve**. If you buy kosher food from a store that is marked parve, it will also be dairy (and meat) free, but might contain fish or eggs.    

(To make it clear, **food either contains dairy, or meat, or is considered neutral aka parve. Parve and meat food will be dairy free. Fish and eggs are not meat nor dairy, and can be paired with anything**).    

Kosher cookbooks often have pareve alternatives (they will say the oil equivalent to the amount of butter for instance).    

Kosher dairy free alternatives might also be cheaper than classic dairy free products. 


    
    


Edit 2: a few people in the comments are saying that **vegan** food is the way to go to have dairy free food. While vegan definitely works, kosher food can also contain meat and eggs **and** be dairy free, which is a good alternative for **meat-lover-lactose-intolerant** folk. Also traditional recipes won't usually contain dairy substitute like cashew or coconut milk, as they were always meant to be dairy free.
