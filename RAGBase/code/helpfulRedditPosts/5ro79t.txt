LPT: If you have a friend who's not doing well in life don't ask them constantly if they " found that job " or " moved out on their own " etc. They might be struggling and feel that you are being condescending vs helpful ( guilty of this personally and changed my approach )

Edit: new approach

What's working out better for me is not asking every time I speak to my friend and not giving him too much shit if I hear something that sounds apathetic to me and just make a comment letting him know I'm there to help if/when he needs it.

Basically still showing support but not riding the issues like a parent would just being there as a friend and not making everything about their issues/shortcomings.
