LPT: Before traveling or renting a new apartment, check the area on Bed Bug Registry

content:
Because it only takes one unwitting traveler to spread bedbugs to a new location, the registry can't possibly be comprehensive. But, that being said, the list of reports on www.bedbugregistry.com is a free and easy tool to help prevent bringing the little devils home with you on your next trip. It's also a valuable tool when renting a new apartment, room, etc.

Unless your mattress fits in your dishwasher, an ounce of prevention is worth about 50 lbs of cure when dealing with bed bugs.
