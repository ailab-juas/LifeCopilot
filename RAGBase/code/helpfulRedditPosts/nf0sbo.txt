YSK: For a successful relationship, it's not just about the compromises. Most importantly, after each compromise, you should still like both yourself and the other person.

Why YSK: Everyone is saying that relationships require compromises. Healthy relationships should be based on support and understanding, therefore compromises should aim to better each other and the relationship. Admitting mistakes and character weaknesses is difficult but leads to character growth. However, changing one's self to fit a relationship to the point where you don't like or recognise yourself is not healthy and will not lead to a long lasting relationship. Love yourself, love each other.
