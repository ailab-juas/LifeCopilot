title:
YSK to never be afraid to dial 911

content:
"I'm a paramedic. Never hesitate to call 911 if you think you need it. Typically there are never ANY repercussions for people on drugs in any capacity when we show up, even when cops are with us [which is about 99% of the time on all calls]. We try not to discourage people from calling 911 if they think they are going to get in trouble. Depends on where you live, but you won't get charged for an ambulance showing up and signing a patient refusal form. The only way anyone is going to find out about your ambulance ride is if your bill is intercepted by your parents, if you're over 18. Under 18, I'm not going into loopholes."
