title:
YSK expiration dates on boxed foods with multiple parts/ingredients (hamburger helper, macaroni, etc) usually only refer to the soonest expiring item in the box, and its not all garbage-worthy.

content:
Why YSK: For example, a macaroni and cheese with a liquid/cream sauce packet inside might say it expires in 4 months. The sauce expires then, but the dry pasta is 100% good much longer than that and absolutely doesn't need to be tossed. Pasta is usually good for a couple years. 

If its dry goods, you can likely toss the culprits of the expiration date and keep the rest for future use in something else, and waste less food and money!

Also bonus tip: things like salad kits often have individually bagged items that expire way later like almonds, cranberries, dressing, etc. You can toss the lettuce and veggies and keep those for future use.
