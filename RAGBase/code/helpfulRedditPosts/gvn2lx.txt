LPT: Before you propose, you and your partner should already have agreed to get engaged. That way the proposal can be a fun surprise, without fear of rejection.

content:
If you are ready to get married to your partner, speak frankly and honestly with them about it BEFORE you start planning a proposal. Have a real discussion about your future together, the big items that affect a marriage(finances, family, kids, careers, etc) and decide if you are BOTH ready to get married to each other. 

It’s a huge decision, and nobody should be put in the stressful position of having to decide in a single moment, or say No and hurt someone that they care about. 

Once you know that they’re on board 100%, you can plan the most elaborate or intimate or special proposal surprise that you know your partner would want. You can purchase the ring and know it won’t be wasted. You can build up the tension for as long as you want until the big proposal day arrives and you both can enjoy it without anxiety or doubt. 

The engagement should be planned so the proposal can be a surprise!
