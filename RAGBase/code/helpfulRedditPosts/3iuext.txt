LPT: Whenever you're taping a box, or packing something away that you need to easily open later, fold one end of the tape on to itself.

content:
This way you can easily pull the tape back off without scraping at it with your nails/fingertips. You can fold the corner of the tape or the whole end of a single side.

EDIT: Seeing alot of comments about using a knife to cut the tape, and obviously that's one way to do it when you no longer need the tape to serve its original purpose. This post was made for those who would like to reapply the tape/don't need to waste time (or tape) applying another piece.
