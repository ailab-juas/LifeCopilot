LPT: When in a cleaning mood, asking "If I had to move next week, would I bring this item or get rid of it?" can help cut down on storage and reduce clutter.

content:
My spouse and I are a little hoardy in nature and our house has a big storage area in the unfinished basement that can fill up fast. Every once in a while, particularly when stuff starts blocking traffic through the area, we go through it and actually get to a decision to toss some items by asking each other the posted question.

It works a little better than some variation of "Are you really going to use this?" because that one can be answered with a hesitant "...mmmmay-be" instead of thinking about actually turfing the offending item, and so nothing gets done.

This doesn't work with our kids though. For them we change it up by comparing one highly-unused item to another and saying "You have to get rid of one of these. Which one?" so they have a choice.
