YSK: Apologizing is not a weakness. It can be very gratifying acknowledging that you were wrong and it's a clear indication of your growth.

Why YSK: Far too many people believe apologizing is a weak thing to do and/or they don't want to admit that they're wrong because that removes the possibility of them being perfect.

Not only will someone you've wronged greatly appreciate it, it's a humbling thing to do and you'll likely feel good afterward. 

Normalize apologizing. None of us are perfect and we all probably owe someone or will eventually owe someone an apology at some point.
