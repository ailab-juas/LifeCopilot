YSK Your new appliances would break down at 10x faster rate than your older ones ( Appliance worker here) Tip: Get a 3rd party Warranty no matter what Appliance you buy and make it their problem.

content:
I deliver and install appliances and take old ones out. I have no idea how their work, but what I have in power is asking question about the old units I’m taking out. 

You’d be surprised how many 2-4 year old units in taking out daily (fridges mostly, but applies to everything as well) 

And price doesn’t matter either. $4000 fridge can last as much or less than $800 one.

Another life hack: if you own Samsung or Lg appliance(US and Canada only, European models build a lot better) and it breaks on you within first few years - more repairs incoming! Abort the mission.

Edit: 
Lol my first post to get that much traction, if I only could post every funny delivery I experienced and questions people ask
