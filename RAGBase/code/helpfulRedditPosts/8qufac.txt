LPT: If you're buying a home printer for occasional use, get a laser printer; they're more expensive up front but way more economical in the long run.

To answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. Laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. Inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. Kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven. 

As for photos, many people have pointed this out and it's a valid concern. Many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. You still have options. 

I mostly despise how the companies are gouging consumers.
