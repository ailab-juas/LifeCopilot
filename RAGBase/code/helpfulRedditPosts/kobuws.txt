title:
YSK that you may require glasses if you frequently have headaches after work

content:
Why YSK: when I was a child I used to have a headache almost everyday during my last hours of school at around 5pm. This was 10 years ago. Since then I’ve been tested for cancers, aneurisms and other possible causes with no results. A few months ago though, I was prescribed glasses as a precaution for driving, I don’t have very bad eyesight and can usually read without glasses. Since then my headaches are gone. What has been a problem of mine for years has been resolved by something so little.

[Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eyestrain/symptoms-causes/syc-20372397) called bad eyesight one of the most common symptoms for headaches. Especially around your forehead, the overuse of the muscles in your eye that focus and sharpen can cause headaches. Regularly squinting your eyes is also be a cause of such an headache, additionally it probably also means that your eyesight is the problem. 

I hope I can save some of you time from pain and a lot of money from CT scans and other medical expenses.
