This already may be common knowledge, but some may still not know about it.

I often see posts of cats panting like dogs with a title similar to "look at my cute kitty! they think they are a dog! :D" and their cat or kitten is panting heavily like a dog would. This is more often than not a sign of [dyspnea](http://www.petmd.com/cat/emergency/common-emergencies/e_ct_difficulty_breathing), heart failure, or other health issues and you should take them to the vet as soon as possible

I unfortunately lost my cat this way about 5 years ago. It was late at night and my cat was panting and I thought "aw my cat thinks he's a doggy". I woke up the next day and he was under my bed wheezing. Took him to the vet but it was already too late and we had to put him down. He had a punctured lung and suffered a slow painful death due to my ignorance.

Don't be as stupid as I was! Even if it is in fact nothing, you won't know until you take them to the vet. Thanks for reading.
