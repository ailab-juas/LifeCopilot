LPT: When you start working full time, make a real effort to hang out with friends who invite you to hang out with them

content:
The days really start to fly by when you're working full time and you're going to have fewer and fewer opportunities to see your buddies from school or college as the number of responsibilities you have increase. Its a real bummer when you clear part of your weekend to see someone and they flake out on you. People remember that.
