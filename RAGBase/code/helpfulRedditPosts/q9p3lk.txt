LPT if someone likes you they won’t make it hard to date them and if they do then you dodged a bullet anyway

I’ve come to recently realize that there’s no way to talk someone into finding you attractive. They either do or they don’t. There’s no in between. While there are exceptions to the rule. In most cases you can’t do anything about it anyway. If you ask someone out and don’t look like you’re homeless or haven’t showered in weeks their response is a good indication of how they feel. Anything but an absolute yes is a no. This is probably common sense but a lot of younger people don’t learn this until later in life. Real life isn’t like romcoms where you can convince someone to like you. They do or they don’t and that’s perfectly ok. There’s billions of people out there all you really need is one
