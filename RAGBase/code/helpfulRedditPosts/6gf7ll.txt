LPT: If you're taking a foreign language class and have to prepare a journal, essay, presentation, etc., use ideas and plot lines from sitcoms.

content:
For just about every Japanese language assignment, I wrote about a Seinfeld episode as if it happened to me. I went to the Hamptons, installed a garbage disposal into my shower, tried to employ the homeless to pull rickshaws, and tried to sneak a rye bread into my girlfriend's parents' house. I even did my cultural presentation on Festivus. 

These assignments are meant to practice your language skills, so veracity doesn't matter. And using sitcoms is ideal because it grounds your writing into reality, so you won't encounter obscure terminology or fantastical scenarios. Plus, it makes these assignments worthwhile and fun as you're not wracking your brain to come up with something more interesting than what you had for breakfast.
