LPT: In addition to having a weekly date night with your husband/wife/partner, have a weekly business breakfast.

So, lots of people know that having a weekly "date night" with your significant other really can help keep your relationship happy. But a lot of times when we have been out trying to have a nice romantic evening we end up discussing how the kids are doing at school, or plans for house repairs or whether we should save more for retirement, etc. Not very romantic, right?

And yet, when you're living with someone, especially in a long term relationship, there are a lot of "business" items which do need to be discussed. The solution we've found is to have coffee and/or breakfast once a week during which time we discuss those kinds of things. Breakfast is a good time of day because you are fresh, presumably are fully sober and have the whole day ahead of you to accomplish stuff. Extra points if you make it a nice breakfast with pancakes, bagels or whatever.

In addition, if you make the business breakfast a time when you can bring up petty grievances, it really can reduce snarking at each other during the week. Instead of having to confront your SO over some little thing when it occurs to you, you can have time to frame your requests in a more productive manner. 

For example, you might want to ask your husband to be more helpful with the laundry. Instead of seeing the laundry piled up and automatically reacting with "How come you never help me with laundry?!" you might instead wait until your weekly breakfast and say "You know, it would be really helpful if you could put start a load of laundry before you go to work in the mornings."

Knowing in advance that you will have time to discuss the "business" of marriage / living together really reduces stress on your relationship!
