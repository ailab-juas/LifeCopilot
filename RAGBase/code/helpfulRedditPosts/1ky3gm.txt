LPT: When house/apartment hunting, drive by at night.

content:
Most viewings/tours of places are done during the day, but if you at least drive by your potential place at night, you'll see more things like:

* What the parking situation is more likely to be.

* If any bright street lights are hitting a bedroom window.

* How safe you'll feel walking to/from your new place at night.

* **Bonus**: if you drive by on a Friday or Saturday night, you might catch some neighborhood house/apartment parties and decide if that's something you're looking for in a neighborhood.

*(edit derp, "parties", not "party's" lol)*
