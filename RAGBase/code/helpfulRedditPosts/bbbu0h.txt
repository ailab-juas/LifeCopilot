LPT: Do not feed ducks bread. Bread provides no nutrition for them, and they could end up being fat and starving at the same time.

content:
Birdseed, frozen corn or peas (thaw first), oats, and other greens (torn up small so they can eat them) provide the best nutritional value to them.  But please do not feed ducks bread.  It provides no nutrition, so they end up being fat and essentially starving at the same time.
