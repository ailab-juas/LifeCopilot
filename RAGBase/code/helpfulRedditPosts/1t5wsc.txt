LPT: Use muscle memory to change (bad) habits.

content:
Mindful movement.

To change a habit (in this research alcohol) push it (or an object) away from you. 

It's powerful enough you can push **a thing**, **anything** away from you for this effect. 

In this research it's a lever. 

This will create feeling and associations. 

So *every* time you want a cigarette push the pack away.

This puts a moment of mindfulness into the feedback loop and eventually your body will remember.


Move the body and the mind will follow.

The magic isn't in the lever.

["The unconscious connection between making muscle movements associated with avoidance caused the development both of negative psychological attitudes and of a visceral gut reaction that helped the patients forgo the temptation"](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-unconscious-thought-and-perception-affect-our-every-waking-moment&amp;WT.mc_id=SA-DD-20131217)
