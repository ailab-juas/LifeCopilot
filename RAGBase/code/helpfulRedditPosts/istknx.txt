LPT: When gifting to someone who is a long time hobbyist or expert in a particular skill, do NOT buy them a random gift related to that hobby/skill.

content:
Chances are they already have it, or have a higher quality version of it, or don't really want corny paraphernalia about it. If anything, ask them what’s on their wishlist related to that topic, or buy them something related to your common interests.

Edit: Wow I really expected this to die in new, so thanks to everyone who commented. I just want to add that I am approaching this from the perspective of a gift giver. Yes, I want the person to know I was thinking about them and what they love, BUT I also want to spend my money on something they really enjoy or will actually use. Why spend hard earned income on something they’ll probably let collect dust?

I think that gift giving culture excessively pressures people into giving gifts as surprises. That combined with the social norm to always say “I don’t want a gift... just get me whatever” makes it very difficult to know exactly what people want because you can’t ask them. That’s why, IN MY OPINION, it’s fine to write someone a heartfelt card and then give them a voucher or gift card to let them treat themselves to what they want.

Ultimately it’s your choice how you want to spend on your loved ones. This is just my philosophy.
