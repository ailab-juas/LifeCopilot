LPT: Spring is here! It's time to check your tire pressure once again.

content:
If you aired up your tires during the winter, chances are your tires are over-inflated, add that to the copious potholes on the road this spring and you have a recipe for a flat tire.  If you haven't done it already, it's time to revisit you tires and see how they're doing.

An over-inflated tire reduces traction and causes uneven wear on the tires. A definite seasonal must.

I just checked my tires this week and they were 12psi over the recommended level, and I had a very noticeable gain in traction when I corrected them.
