When sending in something for RMA, include Skittles, M&amp;M's, or a similar treat in the package. The receiving employee will be more likely to upgrade your item.

I send in things all of the time for RMA. Mostly hard drives and other computer hardware. I've found that when I include a handwritten note explaining the problem with the device(s) and thanking them for their help as well as some skittles/M&amp;M's, more often than not they will upgrade my product. I've received 3TB hard drives back when I RMA'd 1 and 2 TB hard drives, and also have received upgraded video cards. I'm sure that it also depends on what they have at the shop, but the dollar or two extra you spend can't hurt.

EDIT (should have included this originally..): RMA = "Return Merchandise Authorization"
When you have a product that has become defective and is within warranty, you get an RMA from the company. This allows you to send it in. They will check the device and make sure it truly defective and they will either repair or replace it. A lot of the time they will just replace it when it is cost prohibitive to attempt a repair.
