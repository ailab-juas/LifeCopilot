LPT: If you have recurrent procrastination issues in college, focus your energy on your everyday life habits. Treat the cause, not the symptom.

I'll explain myself better :


Procrastination issues in college (or highschool) are usually a **symptom** of a much bigger problem. Instead of targeting this symptom and motivating yourself to stop procrastinating in college, motivate yourself to fix your everyday life habits. 


You need to act instinctively, instead of forcing yourself to act. When you **see** an empty can on your computer desk that has been there for 2 days, you shouldn't tell yourself "That can has been there for 2 days, I should clean that up". Your brain has to instinctively *command* you to act. Without instinct or natural habits, you need to do a mental effort to even complete the smallest actions. Over the years, this mental effort can be harder and harder to execute and can lead to depression.


So, what you gotta do? Aim small, not big. Don't aim for big things like "This semester, I will study every single day!". Start by putting energy on developing your natural instincts. 


**-Expand your field of view when you're at home and spot for things that can be fixed or done quickly.** See that empty can? Remove it. That bill that has been laying there for 2 days? Pay it NOW. Old and empty shampoo bottle has been in the shower for weeks? Throw it away! You don't necessarily have to commit specific time in your day to do these tasks - Just do them as you walk around.


**-React quickly when faced with problems or situations.** Light bulb just died? Even though it's not really an important light bulb for now, plan for buying another light bulb and FIX a date. "Tomorrow I'll buy a light bulb at the grocery store". If you have bad memory, write it down. When you're back at home with your new light bulb, don't lay it on the counter and check reddit. Remove your shoes and finish your task NOW. Another example : Living in an apartment and something broke? Call the landlord as soon as possible, even if it's not urgent.


**-Keep your morning routine!** Woke up at 11 AM on a Sunday? Take your shower, brush your teeth, put some clothes on, eat breakfast, THEN do whatever you want to do.

By doing these simple small habits, you will over time train your brain  to act instinctively. You won't even have to think about it! This will help you immensely in college, because not only you'll feel happier (good habits lead into a lot of positive things in your life), your instincts will help you to motivate yourself. This will also help you at work and at pretty much everything else. You will be in *control*.


This isn't about developing a boring routine either. You can choose to be perfectly responsible with good discipline while still living a thrilling and improvised life.
