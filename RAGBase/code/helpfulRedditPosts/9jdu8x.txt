LPT: if someone is acting out or crazy some day, don’t ask why they are acting weird. Let them know that they seem happy today, because that is usually the reason why.

I’ve noticed this from personal experience. Sometimes when I’m feeling happy, I would act a little bit hyper and energized. When people view this they always ask why I am acting “out” which makes me feel immediately insecure and it will often ruin my mood. Now, when I notice someone is acting like that, I usually mention that they seem happy and they usually are. 

Edit: maybe my wording was a little too vague. I didn’t mean crazy as in clinically insane. I meant if someone feels energized or has a skip in their step. Obviously don’t say that someone seems happy if they’re ripping stuff apart and “shitting in boxes”. Most of the time it is easy to tell when someone is acting out in a positive way.

Edit 2: im sorry this was “trending”. I don’t really decide if my post shows up in your notifications. If you go in settings, you can turn them off. I forgot specifically where in settings but you can probably google it.

Edit 3: Guys... am I manic?
