LPT: If someone *covers you financially in a small way (such as a lunch) without saying something like “don’t worry about paying me back”, then Quickly Take the Initiative in paying them back - no matter how small the gesture.

content:
(*Covers you as in pays for you if you left your wallet at home, or decides one bill is easier than splitting, etc. - not the same as someone intentionally buying you something, that’s a gift.)

It might be easy to assume that the $5 they covered for you means nothing to them, or perhaps you’re waiting on them to ask you to cover them at a specific time - but that’s a decision that they need to directly inform you of. Otherwise, there’s a variety of reasons one Should expect you to pay them back in a timely manner. If you don’t take the initiative in returning the financial favor, you put them in a seriously awkward position while they’re probably just trying to assume the best of you. Without your initiative, the instance will very possibly put untold tension on your relationship over time that equals to much more than the small financial favor was worth - which is why I deem this a LPT.
