Learn to use spices by cooking them one at a time with white rice to become familiar with their flavor and intensity.

content:
Learn what various spices taste like and how strong they are by cooking them one at a time with plain white rice. Use one teaspoon spice (e.g. basil, cumin, ground ginger) per cup of rice and cook per directions. This will give you a basic education to begin creating your own dishes, or the knowhow to discuss dishes knowledgably with others. Later, try combining two or more with rice to see what works together and what doesn't.
