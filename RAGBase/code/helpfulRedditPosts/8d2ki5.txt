LPT: when waiting in the ID verification line at airport security, go ahead and put your phone, wallet, keys, belt, watch, etc. into your carry-on. That way, you move through the scanner area faster and when you get past the scanner, you can just grab your bag and go.

If you need those items, youâ€™ll know exactly where they are and you can always reposition them when you get to your gate. It also prevents you from leaving stuff behind at security. 

Edit: TSA (USA) allows phones ~~and tablets~~ to be in your bag but some airports require all electronics to be out. 

Pay attention and follow the rules is an even better LPT when traveling by air.

Edit: Apparently, TSA requires tablets to be out but phones are just fine in a bag. https://www.tsa.gov/travel/travel-tips/travel-checklist
