LPT: If you’re going to the Emergency Room for any reason, bring your phone charger. Even if it’s for something small. There always a chance they may admit you and may not have an extra charger for you.

It just happened to me!

I recently went to the ER for level 7 pain and after about an hour and a half I was in the admitting process due to a raging infection. I didn’t have the slightest expectation that I would be admitted. I had a car charger that I had a full charge from, but no charging block. My wife was at home with every expectation to see new back at home, as I was already taking antibiotics. I was just there as a precaution to make sure it wasn’t getting worse. It was! Cables are commonly abundant. Blocks are sometimes not on the priority list.
