LPT: Budget airlines that only allow one personal item do not count a pillow as a personal item. Fill a pillowcase with clothes and hug it as you board.

I place a thin piece of foam on one side of the pillow to give it a nice smooth shape (on the side that the gate agent can see).  Spirit charges $40 each way for a carry-on, so this can save you $80 per trip.
