LPT: Stop making awkward small talk by focusing on the rhythm of your speech.

content:
Tl;dr: Look at and listen to your companion after you finish a thought to allow for their (verbal or nonverbal) contribution to the conversation. They will feel like you are listening, and you will begin to more succinctly communicate your own thoughts.

.

Some things that make conversations awkward include:

1. Accidentally talking over someone

2. Ending a long, trailing sentence with "...yeah," or some other babble because you actually have nothing else to say.

3. Talking for too long and losing your companion's interest.

4. Launching into a full conversation with someone who is distracted, but is responding to you anyway out of courtesy.

If you're socially awkward, you may not notice when these things happen, but they're all really off-putting. People expect other people to pick up on small conversational cues, and it's really frustrating to be on either side of a failure in that department. How can you catch yourself before becoming a nuisance? *Rhythm.*

A conversation needs to have give-and take. You know when you feel steamrollered by a conversational partner? That happens when the other person isn't listening, but is instead smothering you with ideas, pausing only to wait for another opportunity to speak. This person is treating you as if you are a member of their audience. They are monologueing. It sucks.

For the purposes of this LPT, I'll define the rhythm of your speech as the rate at which your words communicate a single idea. A "beat" is a single idea unit. Next time you're talking to someone, pay attention to this: how long did it take for you to tell Jenny that a bird flew into your house on Sunday? Two minutes? That's one thought communicated, one beat.

You might feel compelled to keep talking to Jenny. You want to tell her how difficult it was to get the bird dislodged from the space above your kitchen cabinets, or what kind of bird it was, or about that summer you spent working at a chicken farm when you were sixteen. These things are all relevant, but they all compose a new beat in the song that is this conversation. **Before you add another beat, you need to let Jenny respond.**

People who are good at conversation do this naturally, but if you're reading this LPT, you might not. Now that you've communicated your charming bird anecdote, **having a successful conversation with Jenny is more important than your desire to communicate more information.** To that end, you need to let Jenny participate. She may do this **verbally** or **nonverbally.**

Your role is to:

1. Stop talking

2. Look at Jenny

3. Listen to Jenny

**Decoding Jenny's response:**

**Positive/Encouraging**
If she wants to hear more about the bird, Jenny will ask you a question. She may also merely smile and/or nod. A nonverbal show of *genuine* interest is a good reason to go ahead with one more thought. After communicating one more thought (the part about the bird getting stuck above the cabinets, maybe), re-assess Jenny's interest.

**Distracted/perfunctory**
If Jenny smiles weakly (without eye contact), looks elsewhere, says “uh-huh” while performing another task, or is actively reading her computer screen after your first beat, it’s time to bring this conversation to an amicable close. She’s busy, or not interested, and if you linger and try to pile on some more beats, she won’t remember anything about the bird anecdote except that you wouldn’t shut up about it. If she’s self-destructively polite, she might say something as you walk away like, “No, no, I’m sorry. I really do want to hear your story.” You can be dismissive/defensive (“It’s not important.”) or charming (“Sorry, I lost track of time. I’ll tell you later.” Or, if it’s a *really* good story: “How about over coffee?”)

**Change the subject**
If, at the end of your first beat, Jenny begins telling a story of her own, let her. If the conversation swerves wildly away from your original beat after that, let it. Conversation is not a competition. Don’t get upset if you get interrupted, and don’t talk over Jenny in an effort to tell your own story. Changing the subject might mean: “That was a fascinating beat, and it reminded me of something equally fascinating that I really want to share with you,” or “I want to talk to you, but I’m not very interested in the topic you broached in your first beat,” or “I’m a narcissist, and I don’t like having conversations about situations I didn’t witness,” or, “I would like to monologue at you, please sit still while I enjoy the sound of my own voice.” It varies. As the conversation progresses, continue to stop yourself after each of your own beats, and listen/watch for Jenny’s response (She may or may not afford you the same courtesy. That’s okay. Roll with it.) If *she* goes off on a long tangent, you may need to switch to observing your own interest after each of her beats, and end the conversation politely.

That’s about it! Speak, look/listen, evaluate, repeat. Don't be afraid of small silences (your conversational partner might need short gaps to organize their thoughts). If all else fails, (if things start going down an awkward path) look down and compliment your companion's shoes/carpeting/dog/desk chair. They will look down too, which will take their eyes off you and allow you to take a step backward (begin your retreat) or switch topics entirely.

Now get out there and make some small talk!
