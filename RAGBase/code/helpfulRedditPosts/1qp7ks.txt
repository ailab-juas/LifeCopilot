LPT: If you get pulled over at night, immediately turn on your dome lights and place your hands on the steering wheel - you might just avoid a ticket (more inside)

content:
Don't reach for your purse or dig out your wallet; don't go in your glove box for your registration, JUST make your car interior as bright as possible and put your hands at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel. It will give the officer less anxiety knowing you're not reaching for a weapon and he/she might even let you off with a warning for not giving them a heart attack! Some times people forget how stressful it is to be a police officer.

Added thanks to awesome redditors and officer-redditors: 

-find a well-lit safe area to pull over (i.e., NOT in the middle of a damn divided highway). If there is no shoulder, parking lots or gas stations work well. Put your 4-way blinkers on so the officer knows YOU KNOW you're getting pulled over and looking for a spot. They appreciate you not risking their lives by forcing them to stand in the middle of the street (FYI when the lights in the police car go on, the officer already has a nearby place in mind)

-put your keys on the dashboard

-roll down your window if it's deeply tinted, if not crack it so you can hear each other, pass documents 

-rule #1 still in effect

-don't strangle the steering wheel with a white knuckle death grip, that shit is just as scary

- let the officer speak first so you don't come across aggressive or trying to dominate

-if you need to reach somewhere ASK if it is ok if you reach into your glovebox/purse/backseat/armrest etc before just doing it. Then reach slowly (not exaggeratedly slow, but don't be whipping your shit all around)

-tell the officer if you have any weapons in the vehicle (preferably legal ones that you are properly permitted to have). So if he/she stumbles upon it the officer won't be wondering why you were trying to hide it and/or what other shit you could use to cause harm
