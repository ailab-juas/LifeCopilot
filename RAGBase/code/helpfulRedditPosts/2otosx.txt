LPT: Resume tip-- focus on impact and results/outcome showing leadership, creativity, teamwork/building, etc... Avoid words like "participated, contributed, attende, etc..", but instead use, "lead/led, organized, represented, hosted, etc..." Just my 2 cents as former hiring manager..

content:
Let me clarify. Do not lie about your resume. use these words to think and reflect on your prior experiences. during interview a hiring manager will ask you to elaborate on things like leadership, teamwork, conflict management, etc... for college graduates, this is exactly why we encourage students to volunteer for charity work, big brother program, or even boy/Girl Scout. Find an internship at local gov agencies or some political campaign... Do you goto church? Do you teach kids? There are many available opportunities to build your resume or just simply reflect on your prior accomplishments that you didn't really think about.
