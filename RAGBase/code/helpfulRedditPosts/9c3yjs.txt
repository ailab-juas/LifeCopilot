LPT: when interviewing for a job, don’t say anything negative about previous employers, colleagues, or supervisors...

content:
No matter how justified, or clearly explained, you may be perceived as a negative person, or that you have interpersonal skills  issues.  

Be honest, but vague or general.,and try to remain positive.  There are many many ways to talk about leaving a job because your boss was an asshole, without saying “my boss was an asshole”
