Ysk; "Topping off" your vehicle at the fuel pump is bad for it.

content:
Why Ysk; topping off your vehicle at the fuel pump can damage your vehicles evaporative emissions system. At the very least it could cause an annoying check engine light and or hard starting after filling up. Worse, it could cause the purge valves and solenoids in the system to fail or the charcoal canister to fill with fuel. Any of this would cause your vehicle to fail emissions testing. Im sorry if this has been posted before but it happened again at my shop today and I hope I can help people save some headache and money by trying to help make this general knowledge.

Edit: Holy Cow. Thanks for the awards guys. Ive never had a post blow up like this!
