YSK: How to actually escape a rear naked choke.

content:
There's a video on the front page *right now* of a young man showing how to escape a "choke hold". Although I'm sure he's very well intentioned, the advice given will get you seriously hurt.

I'm a BJJ Blue Belt. Tonight when I go train, I'm going to film a video with one of the Brown Belts or Black Belt Coaches and upload it. But I wanted to provide a text explanation of how to properly do it, as well as why his video is incorrect.

Firstly, here is one correct way to escape:

1) Place both hands on the choking arm.
2) Simultaneously drop your hips low (like a squat) and pull down on the arm.
3) Keep hold of the arm and place your hips below the hips of your assailant
4) lift up, and turn *away* from the choke (away from the point of the elbow) bringing the arm with you.
For bonus points: drop to your knees as you turn.

This will throw your attacker *hard* into the ground.

The Rear Naked Choke is incredibly easy to defend against while standing. On the ground, not as easy.

Your primary goal is to get the attacking arm *away* from your soft bits e.g. neck and face.

A properly applied Rear Naked Choke is a *blood choke* (meaning that it cuts off your blood supply to your brain) and not an attempt to crush your esophagus.

Once sunk in, you have about 6-10 seconds before you pass out.

Here's why the video is dangerous and inaccurate:

In the video, the attackers non-choking arm is shown to be under the defenders arm. In reality, that arm will be above your shoulder and pressure will be applied to the back of your head.

The video suggests tucking your chin. All this will result in is broken teeth or a broken jaw. Do not tuck your chin untill you have secured the attacking arm.

The video suggests turning into the point of the elbow. This is the *opposite* of what you want. You want to turn toward the hand - *away* from the choke.

The video suggest taking your hand off the choking arm to attack the leg. Do not do this. Keep both hands on the attacking arm until you have removed it or thrown your attacker.

Finally, this advice is assuming you are *already being choked*. Your #1 self defense is Run-Fu. 

Don't get into fights. Dont get put in that position in the first place. I know that sound like "of course, why didn't I think of that". But your mindset needs to be to *not emgage* first, and escape effectively second.

Bad self defense advice is *dangerous*.

Please research the subject yourself from reputable sources. BJJ practitioners are your best best.

Don't think that watching one video or taking a couple self defense seminars is going to do a *damn thing*. It will not. I have trained for thousands of hours and would still do *everything in my power* not to fight in a self defense situation.

If you are in a life threatening situation, at the very least, you should know the *correct* way to defend yourself.

Edit:

Thank you for all the super positive responses. I didnt get the chance to make the video last night but I'll get to it this weekend at open mat. Where do y'all think I should post it?
