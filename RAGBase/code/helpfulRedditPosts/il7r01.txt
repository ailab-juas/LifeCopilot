title:
LPT: One 18 inch pizza contains more pizza surface than two 12 inch pizzas. Calculate the area of a circle and with an 18 inch you get 256 square inches of pizza versus 226 on the 2 mediums. If you want the most bang for your buck, consider the larger sizes and feed more people for less money.
