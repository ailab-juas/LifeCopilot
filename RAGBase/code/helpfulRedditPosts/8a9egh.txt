YSK: Active Listening, a technique developed by the Samaritans to help people to talk through difficult subjects.

content:
**Active listening may be the most important skills you ever learn.** The Samaritans (a UK-based mental health charity) developed it to talk down suicidal people, but you can use it for *any* situation where you feel like a friend needs to get something off their chest. Some friends have said that I always know how to help them, when the truth was, all they needed was to vent. I'm not a professional so please don't think of me as an expert - please consult the Samaritan's [guide] (http://www.samaritans.org/active-listening)  to their technique first and foremost.


When someone tries to open up to you, sometimes the first instinct is to be **passive**. You care about what they're saying, so you just wait for them to speak and tell you about it. For some people, that'll work. But for some people, *if you don't react they'll think you're not interested.* The other extreme is *to contribute too much.* In your panic to help, out of your mouth comes "That's awful what are you going to do my sister's great aunt killed herself but you're better than that"
Active listening tries to find the *happy medium* between these two options.



This technique is about making someone feel important, like you want to hear what they're saying. In order to do that, here are some basics - please please if you're interested do some of your own research, as it will make you internalise the technique.


*First, use "w" words.* What made you think that/why did you do that/ how did that make you feel/when did you start feeling this way/ who made you feel worst.


It's their story. To encourage them to tell it to you, rephrase their statements. **Parrot.** If someone tells you "5 years ago I was bullied constantly. Now I can't seem to move on"; there are two strands of that sentence they want to talk about. What the bullying meant for them, and why they can't seem to forget it. To tease those strands, answer with,


*"How were you bullied?"*


*"Why can't you move on?"*


Make the noises You know the ones. *Mhmm, Yes, I see*. If they're on a roll, don't slow them down by making them think you're not interested. Similarly, focus on their every word. You are their audience, you care about them so by god **you will keep eye contact even if it kills you.**


Using your best judgement, *insert your own story.* This is totally situation dependent. You will know if they want to rant or if they don't know how to express it. If they want to rant, encourage them with the handy tips above or suggested by the Samaritans' [website] (http://www.samaritans.org/active-listening) (seriously, check that thing out!). If they're afraid of how to phrase it, *use a personal story and immediately bounce it back to them.*


Think of it as tennis. If they smash the ball to you, hit it straight back. They've got the **confidence** they need. If they weakly lob it to you, send it back with your *own spin* on it. "My brother was also bullied, he confided in me. Did you confide with anyone until now?"


*Make them think you care.* Sometimes it's a hugely emotional situation and the above tips will never be as useful as a big hug. Hugs are incredible. If you need my hugging advice, *first of all you may need help.*  But my advice would be to **hug from the shoulders not the arms,** and be comforting without being stifling.


Remember each person is different so the way you talk to people should depend on your personal knowledge of them - if you call someone a pet name, use it. If the person has a more logical turn of mind, *gingerly* steer the conversation towards what you think is a logical solution. If all they need is to vent without judgement, **do not offer advice!!**



Memorise your local suicide hotline. Trust me on this, the professionals should **always** be consulted if the person you're talking to is willing to chat to them.



*You are not a substitute for a professional.* 'Nuff said.



**DESIRE, METHOD, DATE.** If someone is suicidal, use this method to establish the threat they pose to themself. If they want to die, they know how to die, and they know when to die, *take immediate action.* Even *just one or two* of these factors could lead to someone being pushed over the edge by life events and instantly deciding to commit. 


This is important. **IF SOMEONE IS CONFIDING IN YOU NEVER DISMISS IT.** Even a joke can be a cry for help so never discount worrying information based on the *tone* it's said in.


It's a positive thing if someone wants to confide in you. They care about you enough to share a difficult part of their life. Congratulations if you are confided in, and good luck.

EDIT: there are definitely some mistakes I've made in this post, and I've been happy to admit them in comments. For one of my examples I included *why* which has been avoided by many organisations because it sounds accusing. **Why** also lends itself more to a closed question than an open question, and open questions is the other part of active listening that I neglected. Framing your question so your personal views or judgements don't effect their answer is important, y'all. The other mistake I made, which no-one has picked up on afaik, is that the Samaritans didn't invent Active Listening. [According to wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening#History) 

&gt; Carl Rogers and Richard Farson coined the term "active listening" in 1957 in a paper of the same title.

Finally, people have mentioned that prolongued eye contact/ using noises such as *Mhmm* could lead to discomfort or irritation. I totally agree, but I myself am only recently learning to use **any** eye contact in conversation. I'm prone to being a passive listener, so that is why I recommended using these social cues a little bit more. The point of this post was to inform and help people, and I hope it encouraged some of you to do your own research.
