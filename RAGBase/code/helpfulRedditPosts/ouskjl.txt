YSK: Reduce, Reuse, &amp; Recycle are actually in order of importance

content:
Why YSK: Reducing what you consume is by far the most effective of the three, and you should be reusing what you can't reduce!

Before buying an item new, you should get the most use out of the item you currently have, or you should consider borrowing said item from a friend if you don't need this item daily/permanently. 

What most people do not know is that **recycling** falls third on the list because it is the **least effective.** This is why we shouldn't be recycling until we have tried reducing/reusing. Recycling should really be a last resort.
