title:
YSK: If you ever decide to play Monopoly, play The Lord Of The Rings version of the board game

content:
Why YSK: This version actually has an ending! The game includes an extra piece that you place on the board, the One Ring. On one of the die the 1 is replaced with the eye of Sauron. Every time a player rolls this particular die eye-side-up, the ring moves forward one space. If the ring makes its way around the board and lands on Mount Doom (Boardwalk) the game ends and whoever has the most money/property value is declared the winner.
