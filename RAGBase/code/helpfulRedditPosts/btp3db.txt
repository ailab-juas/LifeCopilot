LPT: The purpose of HR is to protect the company from you, not the other way around

Think about it this way: why would a company bankroll a department that doesn't have 100% of it's best interests in mind?

Unions are not bankrolled by companies for this exact reason. 

So next time you have a complaint, particularly with management, consider whether or not you'd be better off going to your union or labor board. 

I unfortunately am not aware of alternatives to unions or labor boards for those who don't have access to either.
