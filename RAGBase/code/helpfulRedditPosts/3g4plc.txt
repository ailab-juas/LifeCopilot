LPT: if meeting someone for lunch at a busy place, avoid meeting exactly on the hour.

content:
Everyone decides to meet places on the hour.  "Meet you at 11 for brunch!" etc.

If it's a busy cafe, my friends and I just say we'll meet at say, ten-to, and get seated and served before the crowds arrive.
