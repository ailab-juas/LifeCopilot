LPT: Before you all go and sign up for Apples new workout subscription service, the Nike Training Club (NTC) app made all of their workout programs completely free and they work flawlessly with Apple Watch

Edit: as far as I am aware, it’s will be free for the rest of its existence. It’s also available on android as well

Edit #2:Thank you all so much for all the awards. I honestly don’t know why the post is still getting them. Please, save your coins to make a smaller post feel special. Spread the love MrBeast style

Also for those who think this is, it is not a sponsored post. I’m just a guy who uses the app. I don’t even wear Nike shoes lol. 

Glad I could help some people save money and get started on their own fitness journeys. Have a great weekend :)
