LPT: If you have a friend or family member that is job hunting, do not keep asking them if they have found a job yet. They will let you know if they have found one.

Job hunting is often stressful and can decrease someone’s self-esteem if they keep getting rejected. Just be there for them and be supportive of the process.

Edit: Wow!! This post went significantly better than expected. Thank you everyone for the comments and the good discussion. I’m glad this has been something helpful.

2nd Edit: Also, thank you good people for the platinum, gold and silver!
