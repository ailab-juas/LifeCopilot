YSK That some Memory Foam Matresses contain Fiberglass

content:
YSK that some Memory Foam Matresses contain a fiberglass flame retardant sock that helps incase of a fire. If you purchase a memory foam matress of a cheaper quality, Primarily Zinus, Aka Spa Sensations, ETC, and take off the "removable" outer casing, (To wash it) you will be exposing yourself to harmful Fiberglass shards that get everywhere and will leave you the gift that keeps on itching. The shards can also cause immediate health problems, among actually shifting themselves through the outer layer of some memory foam matresses. Please be careful and do your research before purchasing a cheap memory type foam matress.
