lpt use a fake employee to handle solicitors

content:
The company that I work for has a manager, her name is Alicia and she doesn't exist.

Alicia handles EVERYTHING. 

She is accounts receivable, she is the owner of the company, she is the operations manager, warehouse manager, fleet manager, parts department. There is nothing Alicia can't handle. 

She has her own direct line and email address. 

Whenever an obvious solicitor that we have no business with calls, we transfer them to her voicemail (she's very busy and often out of town) and give them her email address. 

She is our most valuable nonexistent employee. Everyone needs an Alicia. 

I especially love when solicitors call a week or so after being given her contact information and lead with "I spoke with Alicia just the other day, wanted to follow up". Oh you did? Wow. Crazy.

Edit- it's important to note, someone at our company is responsible for monitoring her emails and voicemails to make sure that nothing actually important is missed
