YSK to never take it personally if you aren't invited to a Wedding or any other event.

[Of course, there are exceptions, but this guide does a good job of laying out how difficult the planning really is.](http://www.shutterfly.com/weddings-guest-guide/?esch=1)

You will never know how many people they can invite, how much money they have to spend, or what kind of decisions went into making out the guest list. 

Another big thing to take from this is to never assume that you are invited. Wait for a hard invitation from the couple . . . don't make it awkward by them having to tell you that you're not. Also, never assume that you can bring a guest. Most people are paying per head and this will just make for a bigger headache. 

There's a lot of other good tips in there about being a guest and with wedding season in full swing, it's always good for a refresher.
