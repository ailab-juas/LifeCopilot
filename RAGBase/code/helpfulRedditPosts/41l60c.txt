title:
[LPT] When teaching kids on how to share things, make one of them divide and the other choose

content:
For example with food or beverage, let one kid slice the cake or serve the soda
And then get the other kid to choose which slice or glass he/she wants.

Next time they will divide everything in perfect halves
