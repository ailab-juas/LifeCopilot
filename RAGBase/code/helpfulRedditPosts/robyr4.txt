LPT: If you have a kid who wakes up everyone way too early on Christmas, wrap a small lego set for them in their room. They can wake up and start their Christmas early with building a toy while everyone else can get some extra time to sleep

Edit: thanks for the awards kind strangers! I was absolutely a day/week late with this but while I donâ€™t have kids I wanted to share something my dad did for me growing up that made the day really special- the Lego set was something I always looked forward to and thought others might like to try as well- happy holidays!
