LPT: About to give a speech? Read it to yourself first out loud with a pen in your mouth.

content:
I used this trick before giving speeches at my Speech&amp;Debate tournaments. Much like how a baseball batter will add weight to his bat before stepping up to the plate, forcing your tongue to fight against more resistance to say simple words will make you enunciate everything very clearly when you take the pen out.
