BABY POWDER.  Or any cornstarch powder, really. They come in many different scents if you don't fancy smelling like a sparkling clean infant's asshole.

Basically, I work with old people and wondered why so many powder their bodies after a shower. I recently learned - BECAUSE IT'S FLIPPING AMAZING, THAT'S WHY. I have terrible tit sweat, but this shit obliterates it. Swampy ass? GONE. My lady bits smell like a summer breeze. I feel so much cleaner at the end of the day, it's ridiculous.

I just got a cheap powder puff and container on amazon, along with a manly-scented powder for my husband. His junk is smooth and doesn't stick to his leg. IN THE FLIPPING NEW MEXICO SUMMER.

Seriously, try this shit. Old people know what's up.


EDIT: As writtenloudly pointed out, talcum powder has been linked to certain cancers.  Talc should not be used on the female genitals or near the face where inhalation is possible.  To avoid any other possible risks, use a cornstarch based powder instead of talcum.
