YSK about Lifeline, the federal program that gives you a free phone and plan if you're low income

content:
If you're on medicaid, SNAP, or make less than a certain amount, there is a federal program that gives you a phone and a plan. The plans vary, but its usually something like 200 minutes, unlimited text, and 1 GB of data. Or other plans with no data and 500-1000 minutes. It varies greatly by state.

The plan is free. The phone is free. This is very important for those that have no money and need to have a phone for emergencies and other things. There are several companies that work within this plan.

This federal program has been around, I believe, since Reagan's presidency. It's been expanded on in the past years though.

You may get a flip phone, or you may get a smartphone. *Or* you may be able to upgrade to a smartphone for 30-40 dollars or something. You can also use your own phone that's compatible with that company's network.

Hope this helps some people. I know a lot of people who could really use this. Things like a phone and the internet are more and more mandatory by the year. And if you're jobless, you absolutely need a phone to call potential jobs and establish interviews. It's a good plan that likely doesn't cost the government much.

So if you make 15k or less, or are on SNAP, or use medicaid, there's a good chance you qualify for a free phone and plan.
