Hunting scent eliminators such as http://www.cheaperthandirt.net/product/3-2020312?utm_source=GoogleShopping&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;gclid=CNesss3EgrsCFbB9OgodnG8AKA work great for getting rid of pet smell on furniture, foul smelling shoes, car upholestry, etc. They get rid of the smell without the strong cover odor that Febreeze has.
