YSK that there is a free library app that lets you borrow e-books and audiobooks

content:
It's called Overdrive.  After downloading it, you need to choose your library and enter your library card information (Step 1: get library card).  Any e-book or audiobook your library has on file, you can borrow for free.  The app is a little clunky, but hey, free books!
