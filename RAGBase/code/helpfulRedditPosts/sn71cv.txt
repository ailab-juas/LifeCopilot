LPT: Don’t go to Koh Tao Island. Lots of tourist die of foul play and their cases are unsolved still

content:
If you ever go to Thailand, just don’t go to its small island tourist destination called Koh Tao. Many tourist have died under foul and suspicious circumstances and their cases have never been solved with many of them being US or UK nationals. Partly due to the small corrupt police force who managed to mismanage all the cases and put them under the rug. It’s suspected that the local “mafia” could be the cause of why these people died. But at the end of the day, just don’t go here, It’s tourist spots are almost the same as mainland Thailand.

Edit: check out Coffeehouse Crime, they put out a great crime doc about this
