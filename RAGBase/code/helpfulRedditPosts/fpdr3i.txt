LPT: Make a habit of muting your microphone on conference calls when you’re not speaking. There is lots of background noise that comes through.

content:
So many of my coworkers have clacking keyboards, vibrating phones, kids, dogs, etc etc and if you aren’t contributing please mute your microphone.

Edit: bonus pro tip a lot of people are mentioning is use Push to Talk. You can google how to use it for each platform use. If I get a chance to look I’ll post up for MS Teams.
