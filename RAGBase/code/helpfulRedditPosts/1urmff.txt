LPT: If a baby/toddler appears to hurt themselves (falls over, hits head, etc.) and they look to you, always meet their gaze and smile :D

content:
I see this mistake made constantly: someone is watching their kid (who is just learning how to walk) run straight into a table that is conveniently right at head height. The kid looks around for mom (or whoever), not quite crying yet but definitely on the brink of tears, and the mom freaks out and puts on a horrified face to match. Kid sees face and begins to cry hysterically.

This can be avoided for the most part by smiling and not over-reacting when your kid looks to you for help. They're confused. They haven't felt like this before (they're 1 remember). They're pretty sure this is bad but don't know yet. They look around for help and to see how others are reacting to the situation. When you smile at them you are re-assuring them that everything is going to be okay. Pretty much without fail kids will calm down almost instantly in response to a genuine smile.

It also helps to lay some [infant directed speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_talk) on them, but this isn't totally necessary, they're really just looking for facial confirmation that they're not going to die.

Obviously you're still going to want to check them over for any serious bumps or bruises but just make sure you're smiling when you do it.
