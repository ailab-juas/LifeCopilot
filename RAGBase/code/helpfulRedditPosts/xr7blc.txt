LPT: Try procrastinating on doing unhealthy things

content:
Cravings for unhealthy things like junk food usually last 15 minutes.

If want to avoid something unhealthy, the easiest thing to do is to repeatedly delay using it until you don't feel a strong urge.  

Imagine that you are allowed to use the unhealthy thing but you have to wait 15 minutes. If you have waited and still want to indulge, then increase the wait time. Keep repeating until you have avoided it for the rest of the day, then repeat.

This works well if you are a habitual procrastinator. You can use similar  techniques that you use to avoid things you should do.
