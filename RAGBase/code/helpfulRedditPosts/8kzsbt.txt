LPT: On a Windows system, hit Win+R and type "shutdown -t x" where x stands for a time in seconds to automatically shutdown your computer after a given time. Perfect if you just want to finish this one youtube video before going to bed, but tend to usually watch another 20.

I know the situation too well where "just one more reddit post" turns into a 3 A.M. binge session.


If I feel like my browsing time is getting out of hands again, I usually look at the clock, round up to a nice, even number and set the shutdown time for the difference in seconds. 

Say it's 11:52 pm, I type "shutdown -t 480" and keep browsing until my PC forces me to quit at exactly midnight.

Windows will notify you 2 minutes before it finally shuts down, and if you changed your mind you can issue the command "shutdown -a" to cancel the shutdown process.

edit: 
/u/Patrikco made a neat website which calculates the time difference for you
