LPT: When you are visiting a friend who is unemployed, don't ask him how the job search is going. Let them bring it up first if they need to do so.

content:
Your friend has been dealing with the stress of looking for work all day long, isolated, ruminating over what could happen, feeling self doubts. Having you come over is a mental health break from all that, a welcome distraction. Don't harsh that by asking this common questions and getting his mind back on that track again.
