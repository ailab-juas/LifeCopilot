YSK mortgage assistance options are available if you live in an area affected by hurricane Harvey

content:
I work for a mortgage loan servicing agent and I wanted to share a bit of information.  If there is a better place this should be posted, let me know.  I just want to help and get this info out.

Guidelines for government mortage (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac) allow for 6 months, or possibly more, of suspended payment forbearance plan, including suspended credit reporting and late fee waivers. At the end of the forbearance, the loan will be modified to help get back to a affordable payment schedule.

All foreclosure and evictions in affected areas are suspended for 90 days.

For private mortages, it will be up to the individual credit unions how it will be handled.

Either way, contact your mortgage lender or servicer and let them know you are in an affected area and need assistance.  

Disasterassistance.gov may also have some helpful information.

Good luck and be safe!
