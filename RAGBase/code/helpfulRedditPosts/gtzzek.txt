LPT: When traveling, purchase something with a unique smell to help you remember the trip when you get home.

content:
Our sense of smell is tied closely to memory. Smells have the ability to powerfully evoke memories in a way that fading images in our minds cannot compare to. The next time you go on a trip that you would like to remember, purchase something that has a smell and use it during the trip. Years or even decades later, anytime that smell is presented you will be immediately transported back to the memories of that trip. It doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be something expensive like perfume. I have found that simple things like deodorant, shampoos, and powder can be highly effective at transporting me back to positive memories of long-forgotten trips.
