LPT: Calm is contagious.

content:
I manage a coffee shop and bakery and I've had a lot of crazy experiences in my life (including being held at gunpoint during a bank robbery and chasing a bear from my front yard, you get the idea), so I'm usually quite calm in stressful situations. One day a family is having some coffee and snacks and the wife seems to be having some issues and steps outside. Husband follows. Shortly thereafter an ambulance shows up. After a couple minutes, they bring her in the ambulance and the husband and son (maybe 7yo) come back inside and the son goes to the bathroom. I walk to the husband and ask if I can bring some ice cream for his son and he says that would be fine. I do so. Son comes back and doesn't touch it much, but that's ok, that wasn't the point of it. Later on the EMTs come out with the wife and it looks like everything is ok. I bring the EMTs some coffee and thank them, then go back about my business. The wife and son leave, but the husband stayed behind a moment to tell me something, "calm is contagious." He used to be military and had a drill Sargeant or CO or someone who told him that. He thanked me, not for the ice cream, but for being calm. My calmness helped him calm down, and that helped his son calm down. In truth, that's what the ice cream was for even though I couldn't have articulated it before.

In case anyone is curious, the wife has a medical condition that can cause her to feint in certain circumstances and it's always wise to seek medical attention when someone feints.
