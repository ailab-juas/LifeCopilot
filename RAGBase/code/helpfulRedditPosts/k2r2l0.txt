YSK: it is better for both human and cat if you adopt kittens in pairs

content:
Why YSK: with Christmas upcoming many people will be getting a Christmas kitten. If at all possible, you should adopt a pair of kittens. Most rescues and shelters will be thrilled to help you find a pair that get along and would love to go to a home together.

For you: It's less work, the kittens will play with each other and socialize with each other as well as you. Plus kittens learn to play gently with a friend and are less likely to bite/scratch you.

 For them: Cats are meant to be social and if you adopt a cat/kitten alone you are committing to be their WHOLE social life. When you're at work, when you're busy, when you just spent an hour with the cat and now have other things to do, your cat is left on its own with nobody to play or socialize with. If there is second one they can keep each other company and chase each other around the house. Having a second kitten/cat can drastically reduce their loneliness and dependence on you for any and all stimulation.

It can be hard for an adult cat to accept new animals so it is much better to adopt 2 kittens at the same time so neither has to feel threatened or territorial. Here is an article from someone much more qualified than me explaining how important this is for your animal's wellbeing [http://www.kittenlady.org/twokittens](http://www.kittenlady.org/twokittens)

TLDR: less work for you, significantly better for the wellbeing of your future cats, adopt kittens in pairs
