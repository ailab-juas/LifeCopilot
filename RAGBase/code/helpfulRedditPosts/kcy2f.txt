YSK How to counteract a kick to the balls.

content:
My Dad taught me this after I took a penalty kick square to the groin during a soccer game. It is goddamn magic and I am horrified more guys don't know about it.

The pain of a ball shot is caused by everything down there contracting very quickly and very violently in what I assume is a misguided attempt to make it a smaller target. **You can counteract this by lying on the ground and having a friend lift you by the belt or waistband. This will stretch the muscles of the area and reverse the painful cramping.** If you are by yourself or are not comfortable with this, lie down and lift your groin upwards as though you were going to assume the crabwalking position.

I have seen this turn laboured breathing and teary eyes into walking around normally in a minute flat. SPREAD THE WORD.

**EDIT:** Just to clarify, lie on your back, facing upwards.
