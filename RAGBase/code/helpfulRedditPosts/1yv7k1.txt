LPT: If you're currently unemployed, or stay at home for other reasons, get fully dressed first thing in the morning every day (socks and shoes included).

I recently became unemployed, and was feeling a bit depressed with nowhere to go during the day. Then I saw a tweet from Emily V Gordon (of The Indoor Kids fame) that essentially said the same thing as my title, and it has really started to help. I feel like I've accomplished something, even if I haven't. It's also helps me to stay motivated while looking for work. Hopefully this can help someone else as much as it has helped me.
