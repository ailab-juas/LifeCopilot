title:
YSK that with all this heat, if you find a bird that’s dehydrated or looks like they’re overheating, NEVER try to force them to drink. You will drown them.

content:
The main “hole” in a birds throat is their airway. If you force water down their “throat” you will drown them with your good intentions. Attempt to cool them off with water, try to provide shade, and provide them a small cup IF they choose to drink. Contact your local bird rehabilitation center for more instructions depending on the species. DO NOT USE COLD WATER. Raptors, for instance, have a much higher body temperature than us and the temperature change can be way too much. 

Edit: yes, as silly as this post sounds, the rehab center I’m at deals with thousands of birds a year that die from this very reason. Thank goodness some of you think it’s silly and would never consider it!
