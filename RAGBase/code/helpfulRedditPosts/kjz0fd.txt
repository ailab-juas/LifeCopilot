LPT: Please check your fire alarms are working, and have an emergency bag by the door should you need it. It could save your life

content:
My downstairs neighbours' flat caught fire last night and we'd be dead if it hadn't been for the alarms.

I didn't have time to grab any warm clothing, grab shoes or anything because the smoke was too much and I couldn't see. I'f id had a bag by the door with such stuff in, it could have been a slight comfort whilst I waited for the firemen to do their thing in the cold London winter. Also, train your pet to not hide when they are scared- the stress of the fire and not being able to find my cat is too much. Everyone is safe now, but please make sure you have working fire alarms!
