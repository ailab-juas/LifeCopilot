LPT: Take the time to reach out to someone who you have not heard from in a while, you never know the impact a small gesture could have

content:
Many of us may have gone a long time without speaking to a family member, friend, or loved one. It can be hard given how busy we are but you would be surprised how much of an impact this could make on someone's day.

With it being the holiday season, reaching out to individuals who have you not heard from may not only bring them joy and happiness but also rekindle a relationship that was previously strong. So if you are thinking of someone, take that small leap and reach out.
