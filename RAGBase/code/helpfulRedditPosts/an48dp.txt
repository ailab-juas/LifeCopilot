LPT: You can pay $0 to medicines that cost $1000s by just applying to manufacturers website!

The obvious step is googling “(drugs name) coupon” BUT when I was looking for coupons for a medication called Xarelto I couldn’t find anything useful. A month’s worth of med was worth around $550. Coupons were taking $50 off max! 
I went to the manufacturer’s webpage. There was a form asking if I could afford the medication without any financial hardship (nope), whether my insurance covered it at all (yes, but a laughable portion) and couple more questions. They than showed a pdf card(a regular card was mailed within a few weeks). With that card I went to the pharmacy, the lady at the pharmacy checked and it went down to $5 from $550! And furthermore, that $5 was a one time payment. I didn’t need to pay a dime for a few more years to come. They were checking once a year to see if I still need financial assistance (do nothing if you still need the discount, or let us know if you don’t need the discount). 
That is only one of thousands of medications that do same/similar discounts. So if you are in need, please make sure to check. 

Ps. I needed to write this after reading the story of the boy who cut back his insulin to help his family’s financial situation. Please don’t do that! All of us might have gone through rough times, but cutting back your medication is not the solution.
