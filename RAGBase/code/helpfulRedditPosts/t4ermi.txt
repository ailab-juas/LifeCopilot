title:
YSK that a lot of car issues are extremely simple to fix yourself

content:
Why YSK: I am by no means savvy with a car. But most car companies make some maintenance very simple to do yourself. For example, changing light bulbs. The bulbs themselves cost $2-$6 and can mostly be replaced in just a few minutes without any tools.

Will save you a lot of money if you had been previously taking your car to a mechanic for these issues.

Edit: from all the comments, it looks like the fan favorite, go-to YouTube channel for learning about car maintenance is ChrisFix - check him out!
