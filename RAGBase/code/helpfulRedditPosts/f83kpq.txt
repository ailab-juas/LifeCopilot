title:
YSK in WA and TX if you ask a police officer to referee a fight that both parties agree to you will be able to do so without having to worry about being charged with any wrongdoing.

content:
The only rule is no weapons or throwing dirt in the other persons eyes and if someone goes unconscious the fight is over.

Edit: got some AWESOME new info on this. Cop doesn't need to be there. As long as a witness sees you agree to the fight and informs any officers that come along it's a mutual combat fist fight (Gentleman's Duel) it's also legal.
