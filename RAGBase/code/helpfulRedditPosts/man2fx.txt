title:
LPT if you’re running even slightly late for work, text your boss and tell them.

content:
They’ll text back and instinctively say “no problem,” you’ll instinctively calm down and drive like a sane human being, if you end up being on time, you’ve just exceeded expectations, and if you’re seen coming in late, you don’t look like a weasel trying to sneak in.
