LPT: for younger people it’s ok not to have long term plans or goals but you should have an idea on what you are working on next.

I’m 54. I never had a long term plan in life as many of you but life is weird. You will get to places you never expected because of circumstances beyond your foresight. 

Some people end up with PhDs or become executives or chefs or nurses etc without that being their original plan. 

Today at 54 I’m fairly successful getting my bachelors in business at 45 and having a break here and there. You will be ok and if 5-10 years looks scary just plan for 1 year or 1 month or tomorrow. It will be ok.
