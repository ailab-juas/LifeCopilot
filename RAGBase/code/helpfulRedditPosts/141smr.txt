LPT: Carry a few dollars in restaurant gift certificates in your wallet for dilemma-free beggar charity.

content:
I was often asked for money by homeless people when I worked in downtown LA. I couldn't in good conscience give someone cash who was drinking a bottle of liquor in the morning.  In-n-Out burger used to have these paper gift certificates that came in $1 increments (they may still, it's been a while.) so I kept $5 worth in my wallet to give out as needed.  I never once got yelled at, or anything but a thank you.  There was pretty frequently a moment of "What the...?" before they realized what it was, but then it was usually followed with a very genuine smile.
