YSK: Not everyone wants your dog to jump up on them and lick them and bark at them.

content:
Some people just don’t like pets and some people are allergic to dog hair or have a loved one at home who is allergic to dog hair. You should always assume someone doesn’t want your dog on them. Some people may be too shy to say anything, and are uncomfortable with your dog jumping on them and licking them. Your dog may be a cute wonderful pal in your eyes, but not everyone feels the same way.
