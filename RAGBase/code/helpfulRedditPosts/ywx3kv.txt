LPT Go clean your sink faucet aerator.

Yeah, that little screen on your faucet where all of your drinking/washing water comes out of? It screws off. If it's stuck, use a strap wrench. Remove it, disassemble it (usually 2 to 3 pieces), and soak it in vinegar. Use an old toothbrush to remove any leftover deposits. Thank me later.
