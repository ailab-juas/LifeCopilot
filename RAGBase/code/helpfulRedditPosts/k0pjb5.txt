LPT - The 8 hours you get from Hothands-style handwarmers doesn't have to all be used at once!

content:
Hothands-style hand warmers (the air activated iron-based ones that feel like a little pouch of sand) work due to an exothermic reaction when exposed to oxygen. This means that if you're done using them, but they still have a lot of juice left, you can reseal them in an airtight ziploc bag. They will cool down when cut off from oxygen, but heat right back up again as soon as you open them! 

Prolong the life of your purchases, reduce waste, and stay warm! 

Happy Holidays!
