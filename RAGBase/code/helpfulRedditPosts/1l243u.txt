LPT: Put a sticker with a fake PIN number on your debit card. Make the numbers hard to read. If you lose it and someone tries to use it (3+ times) the terminal will lock your account and eat the card.

content:
For instance, if you make a 1 look like either a 1 or 7  and/or a 4 look like either a 4 or 9, the person trying to use it will keep trying to use it til it locks as they will not be sure if they are entering the PIN correctly.
