LPT: If you call a tech or customer support line provide only the information they request.

As someone who works for a company that warrantees landscaping items like spotlights and bulbs I constantly have customers overshare and slow down their warranty or impede it completely.

Don't give the full story to the rep. I'll be blunt, we don't really care and you're overexplaining. 

Oversharing is annoying, but the real problem is people ALWAYS share how the warranty had been voided.

"Well,  I was sitting outside watching hurricane Ian and I saw a bolt of lighting strike near my house and my bulbs burned out."

Thats an Act of God. I Can't help you.

Instead, when you call, state you problem in one sentence.

"I have six dead light bulbs to replace"

I promise, if the rep needs more info they will ask. But they will also be able to "not ask" the right questions to help you out.
