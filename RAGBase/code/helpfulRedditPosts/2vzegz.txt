LPT: Mentally Trick yourself into Productivity

content:
There are going to be times in which you really have to get a paper, project, or assignment done and you're really not feeling up for it.  Maybe your brain has become distraction city, or everything on the internet is all of a sudden interesting.

In these moments, to get that extra "push" of work done, everytime you feel the need or want to go do something, tell yourself, "I can't 'x' until I do 'one more page.'"

**Example:** 
**Problem:** I really have to pee.
**Solution:** I cannot pee until I finish two more paragraphs.

**Example:**
**Problem:** I really want to get up and get a snack.
**Solution:** I can't get up to get a snack until I finished this problem.

The mental "trick" creates a reward out of nothing and helps curb procrastination.

**edit:** Formatting.
