LPT: Generally Only Show About 5 Photos From Any Set

content:
The best photographers in the world will only show their top 1% or .1% or whatever of their work. They know the first step to having interesting work is culling out that which is not.

Sort your work, group it by subject/theme and pick out the best one or two of each theme. Then put all of those together and sort out the best five. Make those the ones you share with the general public. Save the rest for friends or anyone who wants to see more.

Even if you go on a vacation or something, tighten up the shots as few as possible. I took about 600 photos on a recent trip to New Orleans. I thought 100 of them were really cool. So if someone wanted to see them, I'd just give them 20 of these 100 to look through. Most people weren't interested in more than 5-10, regardless of which ones I shared. A few asked to see more. This is just human nature. Of those 100, I shared 4 on reddit and 6 on FB and received generally very favorable reviews.

Source: I have taken over 150,000 photos in the last six years, I've shared about 3000 of them publicly, am non-professional hobbyist, but am constantly told how good I am. Because you'll only see the top 2% or so of my work, regardless of my talent. http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdxsean/tags/five042013/show/
