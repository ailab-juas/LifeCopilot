LPT: Hole-punch electrical tape and use the small circular pieces to cover small LED lights on appliances and eliminate light pollution in your bedroom at night.

EDIT:
I’m always amazed by the Reddit community. Thanks for all the comments on my silly idea.

To address some common ones:

I find that good electrical tape doesn’t 100% punch out, so you’ll be left with a circle still attached by a thread to the larger piece; you can rip it right off. It’s not a difficult process at all.

“Just cut a small square like a normal person.” Sounds good! I prefer the minimal aesthetic / less visibility, and taking things a little slower, like a not-normal person. Seems like some others do too.

Good electrical tape (like 3M) is fully opaque and doesn’t leave residue over time — other adhesives like duct tape or painters tape do. 

Products like light dims sound like a cool option too! I prefer the cheaper DIY route &amp; 100% opaqueness though.

Love the nail polish idea too 👍🏻 especially to match the color of the device.

Thanks to the five or so people who just left a genuine thank you comment 🙂
