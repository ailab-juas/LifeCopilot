LPT: Your calendar isn't just for dates, it's for storing information when you want to know it.

For example:

Got a Halloween costume idea in February? Make a yearly costume idea event for Oct 31, and add to it whenever you think of a costume.

Add important tax information to a repeating Apr 15th event.

Add Christmas gift ideas to December 25th.

Bonus LPT: Set a reminder for when you're going to actually need this information. Like, remind yourself of the Xmas gift ideas on Black Friday.
