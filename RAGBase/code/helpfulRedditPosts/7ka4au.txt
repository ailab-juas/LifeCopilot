YSK an easy way to write down numerical codes that almost no one else will decipher.

So the key is the word Quicktrade. Q=1, U=2, I=3...E=0

So say your locker combo is: 13, 22, 42

You could put a piece of tape on the back of the lock with...

QI, UU, CU

This is really useful for numerical codes that aren't practical to save elsewhere but you seldom use. 


I was told it was the only 10 letter word in English with no repeating letters. I'm not sure I fully by that but there are very few if there are more. [edit] Ok, clearly wrong, there are shit tons more.
