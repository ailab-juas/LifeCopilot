LPT: It’s great to receive recognition at work like plaques, certificates, titles, and the like. Just be sure your paycheck is also reflecting your exemplary performance.

Companies will often try to pacify workers by giving them plaques, awards, titles or special attention for their performance to reward employees and to satiate their need for recognition... and so they don’t ask for raises. These things are great, but make sure your paycheck also reflects your exemplary performance.

This isn’t every case, but I’ve seen it enough to know it’s definitely a tactic.
