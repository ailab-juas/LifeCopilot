LPT: When depressed, break everything into tiny steps. With each tiny success, you'll feel accomplishment. Here I provide a list of small steps that help me day-today when depressed.

Depression is so hard. Here is a list I use to help me make it through a day when I am depressed. If I make it to even step 2, I usually end up being able to cope so much better. This is not a cure to depression... but it can help day to day so much, I promise. 

With each step you can feel accomplishment and that you are bettering your life.

Do the steps in order. They go from least hard to most hard. You don't have to complete the list. Start over everyday.

\-1. \*\*Lights\*\*

· Turn on ALL lights and/or go outside if possible (this step can be used to get out of bed).

\-2. \*\*Body\*\*

· Drink some water. Take a multivitamin (B12, Omega 3, and Vitamin D are also good). Even if unnecessary, this can be a good placebo. Eat if hungry.

\-3. \*\*Hygiene\*\*

· Shower, shave, brush teeth, put on fresh clean clothes. (Bonus: clip nails, makeup, pamper yourself)

\-4. \*\*Clean\*\*

· Give it 5 minutes. Throw away trash, do dishes, do laundry, wipe surfaces, vacuum etc.

\-5. \*\*Exercise\*\*

· Just walk. Jogging is better if possible. Or, do yard work.

\-6. \*\*Socialize\*\*

· Small, 1-3 people you are comfortable with. Just call a good friend or family member.

\-7. \*\*Community service\*\*

· Pick up trash in your neighborhood or help someone in need. Write someone a note or friendly online message. Do something for someone else.
