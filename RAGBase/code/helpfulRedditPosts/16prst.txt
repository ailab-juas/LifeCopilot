LPT: Imagine each new person you meet is your future best friend

content:
I'm shy by nature and not very good with casual converstation, especially with new people. This quick brain hack helped me, so here's my pay-it-forward. In the same vein of smiling before you answer the phone, assuming rapport with stranger immediately puts you in a positive attitude. Before you even speak your body language changes, you smile naturally, and the back-and-forth dialogue turns effortless. Since this is your new potential best friend, you automatically treat him/her with genuine respect and care about what they are saying.

**edit**: A bit of clarification on this LPT. This is not meant for every person you come in contact with (i.e. the cashier at the 7/11). I meant, generally-speaking, when being introduced to new people at parties or new co-workers at the office, etc. Secondly, it's a tip to overcome shyness at early introductions for *people who need it*. It's not for everyone. And lastly, assuming a rapport doesn't mean you'll instantly help a stranger with a cash loan or move his furniture to his new apartment, it just allows a comfortable kick start to a good first impression.
