LPT: If you are leaving your house unattended for a couple days, shut off water main.

content:
Remodel contractor here giving you all a friendly reminder to shut down that water main before traveling/vacationing/whatever. I have seen two instances this year of houses that have been completely destroyed by a leaking water supply line. One was a toilet line, the other a sink. Neither of these instances were a result of freezing, it can happen anywhere. A quick turn of the water main before your departure is a very smart thing to do. Bonus LPT: When turning your water main back on twist it wide open, then a quarter turn back 
to prevent the valve from getting hung up.

Edit: Glad to see this post gained some popularity. As many of you have stated, there is a massive amount of variabilities to this tip. There are different valves, heating systems, climates, age, insurance policies, building materials...you get the point. Every single house is different. Figure out the proper way to cutoff water supply to yours. This was meant as a quick tip to point you in the right direction.
