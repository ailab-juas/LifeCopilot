LPT: Use your pockets to remember your credit card at a bar when you have an open tab.

content:
Whenever I have an open tab at a bar and leave my credit card, I immediately switch the pants pockets my keys and phone are in. So if my keys are typically in my left front pocket and my phone is in my right front pocket, I'll put my keys in my right pocket and my phone in my left pocket.

Then if I leave the bar intoxicated – or even just forget my card while sober – I do the instinctive "pocket check" to see if I've left anything behind, and notice that my belongings are switched. This reminds me that my card is still at the bar.

NOTE: I'm a male who keeps his belongings (wallet, keys, phone) in pockets in his pants. If you don't use pockets and carry things in a bag (purse, backpack, etc.) you can modify the trick by moving where you keep an important item. I find that moving your phone works best, because I go for my phone first whenever I leave a place, either to call a cab, check my messages, etc.
