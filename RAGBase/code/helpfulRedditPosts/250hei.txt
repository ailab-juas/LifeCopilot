LPT: how to use a condom correctly

#WARNING: SOME NSFW IMAGES

I'm a sex educator and also do a bit of grassroots organizing for educational and justice campaigns, but I've noticed that there's a bit of misinformation about condoms that are still quite pervasive. I was hoping to clear some of that up with this, so it got quite long.

So, first of all, condoms with human use factored in are ~85% effective. That's disheartening considering that condoms can be up to 99% effective if used correctly consistently. It isn't hard to use a condom, but rolling it up a banana isn't cutting it anymore, so here's a more comprehensive lesson on condom use.

###How to put on a condom
*Each time* you put on a condom, follow these steps:

1. Push the condom to one side of the packet and squeeze the ends together, creating a pocket of air within the foil. If it doesn't create a little dome of air, the foil has ruptured somewhere, and the condom within might have broken or ruptured as well. Throw it out and get a new one. [Here](http://queensjournal.ca/media/photo_cache/content/2012/11/3_detail_.jpeg.jpeg) is a picture demonstrating what the air bubble should look like.

2. When opening the packet (whether with teeth or with fingers!), keep the condom pushed to one side and rip the empty side. That helps guarantee that you don't nick the condom.

3. As you're rolling the condom down the penis, pinch the top of the condom to prevent air from gathering above the head of the penis. If air appears, pinch the tip to push it down and through the base of the condom. An air bubble can facilitate a rupture in the condom during sex.

4. If you accidentally put the condom on upside down, practice safety first and throw the condom out. (There'll be a tip later on how to purchase condoms in large quantities for cheap to help you feel less bad about throwing out the $2 you just paid for a condom at the gas station.) It's not likely, but you could have gotten pre-ejaculate containing sperm on the condom, which you would then place inside your partner, facilitating a possible pregnancy or STI transmission if you are positive for an STI.

5. After orgasm, the penetrative partner should pull out while erect or semi-erect. This helps ensure it will not fall off during withdrawal.

6. Slide the condom off and tie its end. Dispose of it in a trash can. Flushing it will ruin the pipes!

###Sizing and material
It's also important that you choose the correct condom for the penis. It should be snug but *not tight* and should never slip around on the penis. (This is specifically in reference to the common condom on the market -- some novelty condoms have been developed to assist pleasure by allowing movement, thereby recreating the feeling of condom-free sex, but the condoms you're using should mostly stay in one place on the penis.) If it slips around, there's a chance of it slipping off during a sexual encounter.

Don't be afraid to try new condoms frequently. If one isn't working, it's important to discard that pack and buy a new kind. (I promise, a section on buying condoms is later in this LPT!) Remember: a snug, but not tight, condom is most effective. Using a too-tight condom runs the risk of it bursting or tearing during sexual intercourse.

Latex is, by far, the most common material for condoms. However, there are other styles, and they *are* available to the everyday consumer. Rather than summarize this resource and then link it in the references, I wanted to present the Go Ask Alice (a sexual health education resource by Columbia University) on this topic. [Here](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/five-kinds-condoms-guide-consumers) is a link to their topic on condom material

###Tips to maximize effectiveness
Use the right size! I can't emphasize that enough. Once again, I wanted to present a Go Ask Alice answer in its entirety -- this one is on penis size and condom choice. [Here](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/condom-sizes-how-do-i-know-what-fits) is the link to their answer to the question, "*Condom sizes... how do I know what fits?*"

I'm frequently asked what happens when if a condom "gets lost" in the vaginal canal. Well, first off, it can't "get lost" in there -- the vaginal canal [ends at the cervix](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQzX0Y6WPnAnI3Ob2r-v5whu1sMKmtu89ynUeocad3i512JWXPh8Q) (that hole in the cervix is *very small*, akin to the head of a pin), so a condom is never lost. What they're really asking is what to do when the condom slips off of the penis or is pulled into the vagina during intercourse.

Occasionally, the condom will "slip" into the partner being penetrated. It can be due to the fact that the condom is too large, or if a partner has extensive control over the Kegel muscles in their vagina, it may be possible to effectively "tug off" the condom during intercourse due to the clenching. If this happens, reach down and gently encircle the base of the condom with your index finger and thumb, and pull it out of the vagina and discard it and put on a new one. If it has slipped into the vaginal canal, the easiest method to remove it is to slip the index finger into the vaginal canal and scoop the condom out. If this happens, the morning-after pill will assist in preventing pregnancy from any sperm that may have spilled from the condom. It is available without a prescription in the United States for around $35 at Planned Parenthood.

Lubrication is very important in condom use. If the partner being penetrated does not have sufficient lubrication, the condom can break more easily. Oil-based lubes, like coconut oil, break down latex condoms -- only water-based lube, like KY Jelly, should be used for sexual activity involving condoms. Most lubricants will specify what kind of base they have, and if you're unsure, Google can tell you.

###Tips on choosing the right condom
Again, [here](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/condom-sizes-how-do-i-know-what-fits) is the link to the Go Ask Alice answer to the question, "*Condom sizes... how do I know what fits?*"

There are tons of novelty condoms on the market. The variety one can find includes [ribbed](http://www.discountcondomking.com/images/products/Lifestyles%20Ultra%20Ribbed.jpg), [studded](http://www.condomdepot.com/content/product/description/large/crown_studded_side.jpg), [glow-in-the-dark](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v1/119334385/glow_in_the_dark_condoms_night_glow.jpg_250x250.jpg), vibrating (I couldn't find a picture of this one, but it looks like a condom with a cock ring attached), and way, way more than I could possibly list. These can be tons of fun; flavored condoms are a popular means of protected oral sex, for example. However, many of these do not protect from STIs.

The lamb skin condom, for instance, does not protect from STIs, only pregnancy. Many of the novelty condom brands do not protect from STIs as well. The important thing is to do your research. If you find a novelty condom you'd like to experience, it's vital that you Google the company, model, and other things with keywords like "STI protection" or "STI prevention." You can always enjoy these in a mutually committed partnership, but for a one-night stand or other casual encounter, it would be best to stick with more standard condoms.

Evaluate what, exactly, you need in a condom. Do you need STI protection or just pregnancy protection? Is a latex allergy too severe to use a latex condom? If so, explore other materials or choose a hormonal birth control. (Other barrier methods are available, like the [diaphragm](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Contraceptive_diaphragm.jpg) or [sponge](http://www.popgadget.net/images/sponge.jpg), but those are closer to 75% effective with human use and I don't have a detailed write-up on their use.)

Most ribbed, studded, and other easy to buy condoms *do* protect from STIs. The best rule of thumb is that, if you're purchasing online, Google is your friend. If you're purchasing in the store, they're more likely to protect against STIs, but reading the box will suffice as they must be labeled with what they protect against.

###BUYING CONDOMS
Now, for the important part: buying condoms. Condoms, in stores, probably cost around $1 apiece. These can range much higher for expensive, brand-name condoms, however. There are many low-cost options. Here are some suggestions for buying condoms:

1. If you can't afford condoms but are sexually active, go to your local [Planned Parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/). They will usually provide condoms at either no cost or an incredibly low-cost to you. While there, you can also inquire about long-term reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like the shot, the implant, or the IUD, and many Planned Parenthood health centers have funds to assist low-income patients receive LARC methods, as they've been proven to be most cost-effective and have higher retention rates.^[a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910826/) You can also pick up a morning-after pill to store in your medicine cabinet while you're there.

2. If you have some money to spare, you can buy in bulk. A few popular websites are Condom Depot^[b](http://condomdepot.com) and Amazon. At Condom Depot, for example, you can buy 100 Durex condoms for $39.99. That's nearly $60 cheaper than in-store purchases and they can be delivered to your door. (Beware: different companies have different levels of discretion and privacy, so you'll want to Google reviews of companies as you consider your purchase.) Most condom-specialty stores, like Condom Depot, offer sampler packs as well; this is a good way to find the right condom for you and/or your partner.

3. If you are uncomfortable going to Planned Parenthood or want to go further from your home than the nearest center, use the Condom Finder^[c](http://www.condomfinder.org/) website or app near you.
