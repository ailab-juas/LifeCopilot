LPT: Do not be intimidated by tailgaters and speed up, they will only keep up. Maintain a greater distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you to compensate for the lack of safety distance behind you. This will give both vehicles more time to react to emergencies.

content:
Ideally everyone keeps a safe distance. Unfortunately, not everyone has an accurate judgment. This is the least you could do to reduce chances of collisions.

edit: seems like there are many comments advocating a lane switch. Just want to note that city roads and highways often have different laws. In city roads, you do not have to stay on a specific lane when you're not passing. Additonally, generally lane changes increase risk of accidents. A  third point is that turns are everywhere in the city, and you do not want to be switching lanes to let tailgaters pass, when you need to be on the current lane to make a turn.

edit2: while it is satisfying and feels powerful to frustrate tailgaters by doing _________ (e.g. brake check, slowing down to unreasonable speeds), that is not safe. Whatever sense of satisfaction gained from that is hardly worth the risk.

edit3: quoting u/foxtrotsierratango's great point.

&gt;More time to react leaves out the important clarification: Make your actions much more gradual so the car behind you doesn't have to deal with a drastic change. Instead of coming up to a pack of cars and braking, take your foot off the accelerator and coast gently applying brakes as needed. Accelerate slowly and evenly. Be as smooth as possible.
