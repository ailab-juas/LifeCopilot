YSK that, while honesty and candor are important qualities in a person, if you base your entire personality on "Telling it like it is," you're probably just a jerk

content:
Why YSK: It's important to be honest with others, but there's a big difference between constructive criticism and criticism for the sake of criticizing.

A slightly exaggerated example from my life: If you have a friend who accidentally got a girl he just met pregnant, but six years later they're happily married, financially stable, and have more kids, you add nothing to the world by referring to their kids and entire relationship as "accidents" every time they're brought up.

In the immortal (paraphrased) words of The Dude: "No, you're not wrong, you're just an asshole."

Saying "That's just me, I tell it how it is" isn't an excuse or an apology for being unnecessarily mean.
