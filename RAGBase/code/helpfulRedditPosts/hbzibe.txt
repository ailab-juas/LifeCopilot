YSK: Today is Juneteeth if you didn't already know.

content:
I grew up in the south and this was something that was not taught directly to me and if it was it was so briefly covered i do not remember going through it. A lot of people are now getting today off from their companies and I ask everyone to spend some time today doing some research and educating yourself on the history of this day.

"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." Lets make the world a better place people.

 EDIT: Adding this in: **Juneteenth** is an unofficial American holiday and an official Texas state holiday, celebrated annually on the 19th of June in the United States to commemorate Union Army general Gordon Granger announcing federal orders in the city of Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, proclaiming that all slaves in Texas were now free. Although the Emancipation Proclamation had formally freed them almost two and a half years earlier and the American Civil War had largely ended with the defeat of the Confederate States in April, Texas was the most remote of the slave states, with a low presence of Union troops, so enforcement of the proclamation had been slow and inconsistent.
