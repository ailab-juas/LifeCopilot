YSK gasoline containing ethanol will generally shorten the life of your snowthrower, lawn mower, etc. Use a stabilizer and/or purchase gas w/o ethanol.

content:
I use gas station gas, premix it with a stablizer and run it out after every use.  Then I add a small amount of ethanol free gas (expensive) to the tank and run that out too.  It's a pain, but better and cheaper than getting all of my small motors repaired every year / few years.
