title:
LPT: If your leading a conversation/telling a story and you get interrupted or the topic gets switched, learn to accept it and move on.

content:
When the audience is actually interested they will ask you to continue with your story after the interruption. If not then people were done listening anyway and have already moved on. If you try and bring it back up yourself you come off as desperate or just kinda socially awkward. Better to keep conversation credibility and go with the flow and don't get upset by it. You will have a better social outcome in the long run.
