YSK: You should take your dishwasher apart and clean it out every once in a while.

content:
I decided to try and figure out why my dishwasher wasn't working as well as it should. So I watched some online videos and decided it was time to take matters in my own hands.

I took mine apart and found all sorts of crap in there. There was about 5 pieces of plastic. Some pieces of ceramic from a mug that broke in the dishwasher, a whole lot of what looked like a paper towel, and, of course, food bits, grease and other nasties. A lot of that stuff was clogging up all the drain holes in the dishwasher.
I put it back together and am running a cycle now with a cup of vinegar to give it a good internal cleaning.

I think I am going to add this to my calendar to do once a year. Took about a half hour to do the whole process start to finish, and a lot of that was all the crap that was in there.

**WARNING:** If you've ever had glass break in your dish washer, there may be sharp pieces of glass down there. Proceed with caution, lest you slice your hand open.

**UPDATE:** Running first load since the cleaning.  Dishwasher is definitely louder.  Not like "it's making a funny noise" louder.  More like, "the water pressure in the dishwasher is much higher" louder.  We'll see how the first load works.

**UPDATE 2:** Load is done and spotless compared to before.  The glasses are clean without any kind of residue on them.  The water pressure for the spray bars is definitely better than it was before.  I had problems with not all the dish detergent getting out of the dispenser when the door popped open.  Now it's spotless.  10/10.  Would recommend everyone do this.
