YSK that if you've ever used a fire extinguisher, even for a second, it needs to be replaced/recharged. It will soon become useless otherwise.

According to sources that got this post auto-deleted in the first place (see comments below), just using a fire extinguisher for just a moment releases ~~crystals~~ particles that can attach to the very seal that holds them in, rendering the device useless unless it is replaced or recharged. Talk with your local fire department on where you can do so.

EDIT: Thanks to /u/CatsAreGods for notifying me that I said "crystals" when I should have said "particles". Thank you very much.

EDIT: According to /u/phrazel, only "Class K, CO2, halon, Halotron, FE-241, water and others. Any liquid, or gaseous extinguisher...will not leak if used but should be recharged if you do more than bump them." So still have them checked regardless. Thanks to /u/JustinCayce.

Regret comes afterwards, stay safe.
