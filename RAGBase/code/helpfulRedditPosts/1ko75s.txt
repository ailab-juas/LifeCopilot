LPT: Scrape away your card security code to disable your card from being used if stolen.

content:


Use a key to scratch the three security numbers (CVC) off of your credit card, so that no one but you can use it to make purchases online.

WARNING: Of course you have to remember these three digits to be able to buy things online yourself. But I suppose just writing them down on a piece of paper and keeping it in a drawer (if you have a shitty numeral memory) would still be safer than having them on your credit card.
