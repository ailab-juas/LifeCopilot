LPT: Pay attention when someone flashes their high beams at you

content:
If you are driving down the road and a passing car flashes their high beams at you give extra attention to your surroundings. There could be a police officer around the next turn, an accident over the next hill, a slow moving vehicle or buggy around a blind curve or a fallen limb from a tree on the road. Don’t slam on your breaks; just give a little extra attention to the road and your surroundings. 

If it keeps happening though; check to see if your light or car is the problem. Maybe you forgot to turn your lights on when getting into the car before the sun went down. Maybe you left your high beams on and are making it hard for others to see. Perhaps your low beams need adjusted to better aim on the road and not at oncoming traffic. Or perhaps there’s a person or object surfing on top of your car and you had no clue.
