LPT: Have car and an Android phone?  Get one of these.

content:
[Bluetooth OBD Scanner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KL0I9I/).  There a lot of different sellers with basically the same thing, so search around.  Plug it in, set up pairing, download any of the Android apps that will connect to it and read it (I use Torque), and know everything you want to know about how your car is running.

You can also find equivalent programs to connect to non-Android devices, if they have Bluetooth, or a Bluetooth dongle to connect to it.

Anyone else use this?  What's your favorite display setup?  I'm a commuter, so I keep a big display of the instantaneous MPG and trip average MPG graph on my display most of the time.
