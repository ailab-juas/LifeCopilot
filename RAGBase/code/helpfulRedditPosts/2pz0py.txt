LPT:If in an area with no mobile reception but WiFi, turn on flight mode, then WiFi back on to save battery life.

To expand... Once you activate flight mode you can then turn on your WiFi only. What this does is stops your phone from constantly searching for a tower which greatly increases your battery life. I'm assuming most mobiles can do this.
Thanks
