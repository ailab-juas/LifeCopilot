title:
YSK that most employers have an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that offers free, short-term counseling.

content:
 Why YSK: I am an EAP counselor for a large government agency, and a lot of folks are not aware of this benefit. If you are in need of support/therapy but do not have the funds or insurance, check if your employer offers this benefit and how to access it. Therapy can be expensive, even with insurance, so taking advantage of this FREE benefit can really help bridge that gap! As a therapist myself, I can't afford the self-pay costs some therapists have and have taken full advantage of this service myself.

ETA: Each EAP program is different, so check with your provider to see what your benefits are. It's definitely worth a look.

Edit 2: Where I work, everything is confidential. In my 3.5 years experience at this particular job, I have not encountered anyone who lost their job because they used EAP. They lost their job because of their work performance or other external factors. The service isn't for everyone, and there are, unfortunately, going to be programs and therapists out there that are complete shit. If you don't trust it, then don't use it.
