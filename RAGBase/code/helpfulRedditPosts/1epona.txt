YSK just because a piece of jewelry has "14k" stamped on it, that doesn't mean it is real.

content:
I work at a cash 4 gold place and this situation arises almost daily. A person brings in a piece of gold jewelry and after I test it, I tell them it isn't real gold. Then when I hand it back to them, they proceed to squint their eyes and point to the clasp and say 

Them- but it say's 14k on it!

Me- Yeah, I know what it says but, did you see me test it? That's the only thing that matters.

Them- why would it say 14k, if it isn't real?

Me- to trick people 

There is no official marking for jewelry. It can have 14k stamped on it and be fake, or have nothing stamped on it and be real.
