LPT: in public speaking or interview situations, practice avoiding filler words such as “like” or “umm”, and don’t be afraid to briefly pause to collect your words. This will help you seem more assured in your statements and responses, and shows you’re thinking carefully about your statements.

Edit: as this post becomes more popular, some people in the comments are suggesting this promotes discrimination or judgement of interviewees. I am providing this advice to help improve communication skills in these types of situations - not because they’re a conscious expectation. Skills such as these can help in a less conscious manner, such as maintaining eye contact, using relaxed body language, etc.
