YSK: There Are Blood Banks for Pets

content:
Yes, there are blood banks for your furry friends. Obviously, mostly focused on dogs and cats since they are most popular. 

These services often are in need of proper and reliable donors. 

The blood banks exist for the same reason human blood banks do - to offer transfusions to sick pets and those undergoing surgery. 

Greyhounds are the most common dog donors as they genetically have more red blood cells in their blood. 

Any cat can donate, but most banks prefer they are on the larger side, weight wise, to handle the rigors of donation.
