title:
LPT: See a therapist even if you aren't depressed.

content:
Seeing a therapist was the best decision I ever made. I told them up front that I am not looking for a diagnosis or for medication, I am just looking for someone to vent and talk to. They help you brainstorm, any problems you have you can talk to them about it, any stress you have you could talk to them about it, you can talk to them about anything and everything. 

It is expensive so make sure your insurance will pay. I only pay a $65 copay every time I see mine for an hour, the going rate for a therapist is around $155 for 50 minutes where I'm at without insurance.
