YSK, using your turn signal isn't just courtesy and the law, it's necessary to communicate with other drivers.

If you need to get over, most people will let you... IF you use your signal. 





Why won't they let you without it? Because they're not psychic and they don't know you need to get over. 






Living in Dallas,  this is a pretty common occurrence,  but today I had the realization (after a man roadraged at me for missing his turn) he didn't understand that I was unaware of his need to get over! 






USE YOUR BLINKER.  Not exactly when you're turning,  not exactly when you need to get over,  but well in advance.





EDIT: To all the people commenting "In (insert place), a blinker is seen as a challenge and people will speed up"






Two things. First,  okay. Let them. Move over behind them. 






Second,  a blinker is a notification and not a request. If you gently but firmly begin to move over, MOST people will back off. Just make sure to give a friendly wave.


EDIT II: HOLY SMOKES,  platinum AND the front page of reddit? The internet points aren't real, but the dopamine sure is!
