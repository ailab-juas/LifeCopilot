LPT: get your finances in order by your 20s or spend your 30s repairing all the damage.

content:
In my 30s I am constantly being reminded that I spent my 20s spending frivolously. My finances are a wreck, I have nothing in savings, and currently have a little less than $200 in the bank. I am just now making a budget. Don't be like me. Track and keep your finances in order early.

Edits:: -I am aware of living within your means and making ends meet. I didn't do either. I am very deep in debt. 
-I was such an impulse buyer. I'm a little better now, but impulse buying is what has gotten me into trouble.
-I have a bachelor's degree.

NOTE TO THOSE WITH RUDE COMMENTS:: I am NOT looking for sympathy. I'm not looking for handouts. I have been given an unfortunate lot in life and some of it is hard to deal with. I have some mental disabilities that make it extremely difficult to hold down a full time job. I'm not entitled. Nobody pays for my things.  

Well this just blew up my inbox!
