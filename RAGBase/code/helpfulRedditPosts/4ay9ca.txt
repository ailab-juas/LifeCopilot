Research at the University of Ottawa is attempting to unravel whether physical training can induce physiological changes in the way we sweat. This change could precipitate a way in which sweat glands are activated, which could be of benefit when exposed to conditions of extreme heat and humidity. The findings of this research will help pave the way for better heat wave guidelines and workplace climate safety limits for both occupational (miners, military, etc) and sports competition settings. While guidelines exist, some of them are overbearing, specifically the use of fans during a heat wave which the same researchers recently demonstrated (see here: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2015.153)

**EDIT 3:** HOLY! Never had this much upvoting! **Please Watch the video! Views = Support!**

**EDIT 2 :** Thank you for all the interest! Honestly I have never had a post reach above 20 upvotes before! Please watch and share my video as this is part of a research contest which ends today :)
