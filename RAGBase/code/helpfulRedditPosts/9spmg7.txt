LPT: If you ever find yourself stranded in the middle of nowhere, stay with your vehicle. You are much more likely to be found by searchers and will have shelter if needed.

As a local search for a missing 74 year old hunter enters the fifth day, I'm reminded of what a Search and Rescue worker once told me, "Stay with your car, because we always find the car".  This has proven true in the case of this hunter.  His truck was found stuck in a ditch one day after he was reported missing, but unfortunately he has yet to be found.
