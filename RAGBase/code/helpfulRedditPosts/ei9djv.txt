LPT New Year: Turn all of your hangers backwards in your closet on January 1. When you wash and hang an item you wore, hang the clothing normally. At the end of the year, donate all clothing with the hanger still backwards. You haven’t worn it in a year.

You don’t necessarily have to get rid of it all. At the VERY least, go through all of the clothing that has the hanger still backwards. You haven’t worn it in a full year, do you even still need it?
