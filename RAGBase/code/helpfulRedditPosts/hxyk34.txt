YSK If you are a homeowner or renter, your home has a main water shut-off. The time to learn where it is, is right now.

When I bought my home 8 years ago, the prior owner made a big deal of showing me the water cut-off.  It is in a closet.  Today a pipe burst under my sink, and tons of water starting pouring everywhere.  Luckily, I remembered where the cutoff was, and I killed the water to the whole house.  Zero damage.  Just a big mess to cleanup.   If I didn't know where that cutoff dial was, it would have been thousands of dollars of damage.
