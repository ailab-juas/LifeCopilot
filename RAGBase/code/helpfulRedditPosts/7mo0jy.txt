LPT: If you're younger person looking for a (summer) job, ask some home builders if they need an apprentice/ helper. You won't make a lot and it will be hard work but it will pay for itself 100x over when you get older.

This is one thing I really, REALLY wish I had done when I was younger.  To be able to learn the right (and sometimes wrong) way of doing large home projects a lot of people might not tackle on their own will give you a ton of perspective when you're buying a home in the future as well as give you the tools to take care of (or even build) a home yourself.
