YSK about Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, a charity which promotes child literacy by sending free, age-appropriate books to any child ages 0-5 each month regardless of income in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Over 816,000 children have received 60 million free books to date.

Country music star Dolly Parton set up a charity in 1995 which sends any child in the US, UK, Canada, or Australia a free, age-appropriate book in the mail each month, with the goal of encouraging children to love reading. 

Registering a child is free and requires filling out a simple online form on the above website. Then, the child will receive a free book each month until his or her 5th birthday. This seems like it would make an especially thoughtful holiday or birthday gift for the family of a child in your life.

Note: I am not in any way affiliated with this charity or Dolly Parton -- I simply heard about this service from a family member and thought it was a novel idea which anyone can take advantage of to help a child they may know or love, especially around the holidays.

**Edit:** Some people have correctly pointed out that the service isn't universally available in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada -- only in areas with participating chapters/libraries. If I could, I would edit the title of this post accordingly. However, the fact remains that any child age 0-5 can get free monthly books regardless of income provided there is a participating chapter nearby.
