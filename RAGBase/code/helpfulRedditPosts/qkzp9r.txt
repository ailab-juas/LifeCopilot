LPT: Your employer cares more about your attendance than your performance.

content:
You could be the hardest worker, while on site, but if your attendance is sketchy you will not qualify for promotions/raises.

 You could be an average worker who never is late or misses a day and you'll become manager. 

 Attendance and tardiness is the #1 factors of any job.
