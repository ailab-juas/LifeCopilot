YSK that Spotify doesn't just have music--it also has lots of stand-up comedy!

content:
I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Spotify has a spoken word category, including stand-up comedy.  There is material that hasn't been posted on Netflix or YouTube, and in the "Word" category on browse there are collections of comedians that have helped me discovered new ones.

Not sure if this is big news for anyone else, but I want to pass it along!
