LPT: Service industries aren't loyal to you, don't worry about being loyal to them

content:
Did you car insurance company raise your rate as part of a "system adjustment" even though you've had no accidents? Find a new insurance company. Better new customer deal at a cell phone company than what your current provider gives you? Ditch them. There's nothing to be prideful about being with x company for x amount of years unless they continually give you the best deals and service possible. You're just a customer to them; they should be just a service to you.
