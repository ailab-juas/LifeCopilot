LPT: do not place anything not in packaging on grocery conveyor belts!!

content:
I never realized till I worked as a cashier just how dirty they really are. We try our best to clean them but they are never clean. I have blood from raw meat, milk, sticky spots, seafood water, and more spilt on the belt almost every shift. And yet I continue to see people not bag their produce or meat. And set them directly on the belt. I've seen people drop stuff and eat it off the belt. Heck I even had one lady let her baby crawl on the belt and let the baby stick its hands in their mouth. Seriously we do our best but they are not clean! Bag things and try to have minimal contact with them!!
