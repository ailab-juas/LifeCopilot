LPT: Employers can't make you stand around after you've punched out.

content:
This happens a lot in restaurants. For example the MOD will make you punch out so they can do the nightly closeout, but you have to stand around and all leave together or actually still have to do sidework. Even if it's just 2 minutes or 20, they have to pay you if they require you to be there. If this is happening to you, record dates and times, take it to your states wage and labor board and get what's yours. Those 15 minutes past each shift add up. You could report it to your company, but remember HR only looks out for the company. Not you. Government agencies are there to protect you 

*Disclaimer- not a lawyer. Just someone who worked close to that industry and seen it happen

EDIT:  As per reddit norm, some bozos are coming out of the woodwork to add their idiotic remarks from the safety of behind their computer screen. This LPT is meant to inform those that didnt know. They are free to do what they want with this information. My motive for posting this is I dont like to see companies taking advantage of their employees.

EDIT 2: Lot of good discussion and people are bringing up good points and relating relevant anecdotes that make me want to clarify: Shit happens. Sometimes you're on the way out the door at night and someone realized they forgot to do something so everyone goes back in and cleans off a table etc. This LPT is more geared towards systematic wage theft in which it happens numerous times
