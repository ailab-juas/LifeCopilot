Wear the same cologne for a year and then never wear it again

Hate keeping a journal? Memories of adult life all blurring together into a never ending stream of work-home-sleep that makes you quietly wish for a meteor to strike your apartment building? 

Try wearing the same cologne for a year and then never wearing it again!

While it won't help relieve the crushing depression of adult reality, it will help you remember key points in your life. At least for me it does. 

Memory and smell are deeply related:

By wearing a certain scent for a while, you'll link moments of your life to that smell. By never wearing that scent again, you'll have put those memories away, available for triggering whenever you spray a little cologne in the air. 

Though for me, it's rarely specific memories and more general emotional ones. Still, it's kinda neat.
