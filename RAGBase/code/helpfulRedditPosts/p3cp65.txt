LPT: There's nothing wrong with going out to eat, going to movies or even amusement parks alone. If you're wanting to do something, do it whether you have anyone else free or not. Going alone can be fun.

If you're self conscious about it, try to picture the last person you saw at a movie alone. You won't remember them and others won't remember you. Everyone is focused on the movie they paid to see anyways. 

 At Cedar Point once I went there as I had to use some PTO. Drove up for a day and got on rides probably 10 minutes faster with them asking for single riders to fill the train. 

On a photography this past year, went out to eat alone for an early dinner. Ended up talking to the waiter and another employee about the area and got some tips on where to go for photos. We talked for a good 30-45 minutes while they were slow on customers. 

Don't wait for others to be interested to do what YOU want to do.
