LPT: Instead of buying a dog as a Christmas present, buy accessories such as a leash, collar, and bowl. Your child can open these and get excited on Christmas morning. Then, when things have settled down, you can take your child to the shelter to pick out a pet together.

Animal shelters fill up with unwanted "presents" in January. If you hold off just a little, you can be a part of the solution AND find a pet that jives with you and your family's personality.
