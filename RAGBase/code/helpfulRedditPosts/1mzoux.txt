LPT: When dividing up ground beef in Ziploc bags, flatten it out before freezing it. It'll thaw faster when you need it.

I buy ground beef/turkey in bulk and I divide it up into ziploc bags.  I always flatten out the ground beef into a sheet within the ziploc bag so that it thaws faster when I need to cook it.
