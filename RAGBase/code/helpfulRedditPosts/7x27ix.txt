LPT: [US] If your adjusted gross income is $66,000 or less, you probably qualify for free tax filing software for both Federal and State returns.

I posted this last year, but reposting it again to spread the word.

The IRS has a tool that will allow you to input some basic information about yourself (age, income, state, AGI) and it will provide a list of all efile software that will allow you to file your taxes for free and the requirements for free filing with that software.

[Here's the link.](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp)

Also note that you never have to pay to file your taxes. Even if you make over $66,000, you can always fill out the forms yourself (either with paper, or with free fillable PDF forms).
