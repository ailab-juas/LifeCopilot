LPT: often, being liked doesn’t require you to be interesting/funny. It just requires you to make other people feel interesting/funny.

I’m not saying people never gain pleasure from others being interesting or funny. But the fact is in most interactions, everybody is heavily self-monitoring and will base their judgement of the success of the interaction on how people responded to *them*. If people laughed at their joke. If people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. If people agreed with their opinion. 

So the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they’re boring is: you don’t need to put so much pressure on yourself. Honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you’re talking to. Listen. Ask questions/follow-up questions. Laugh at their jokes. And they’ll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to. 

Edit: for those saying isn’t this just ego-stroking or being fake, it’s not about sucking up to the other person at all. It’s just empowering you to worry less about what you’re saying, because the other person is almost certainly experiencing you in terms of how you respond to what they say anyway. 

Edit again: no I’ve never read How To Win Friends and Influence People but I think I’ll have to after this haha
