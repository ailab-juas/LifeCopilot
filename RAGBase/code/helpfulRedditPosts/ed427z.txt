LPT: If you're cooking something that calls for bacon (like southern green beans, quiche, or soups) buy bacon ENDS instead of full strips

content:
Many butchers and grocery stores offer a product called bacon "ends"- quite literally the ends, scrappy bits, and otherwise unusually-shaped pieces left over from trimming the back and belly slabs into bacon strips.

I pay about $2.50 for a 3/4 lb. package at my local grocery's butcher counter- literally 1/3 of the price of an equivalent package of strips, and after trimming, chopping, and frying up the pieces I have enough bacon for 2 dishes, PLUS about 4 oz. of fat to cook with later.

Even better, you're using something that might otherwise be wasted! That's a win-win in my book :)
