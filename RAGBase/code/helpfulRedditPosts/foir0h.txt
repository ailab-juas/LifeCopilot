LPT: For everyone working from home, the original P90X is all up for free on archive.org

content:
Since quarantine threw off my gym schedule, I went on a hunt to find a workout and [wait for all this to blow over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiKx8lOEktQ). To my surprise, [archive.org](https://archive.org) of all places had the entirety of P90X, for streaming and download. Now I can get a 12 pack in the comfort of my own home. 

You can find the entire OG Tony Horton P90X [here](https://archive.org/details/P90XNutritionGuide_201702).

Stay safe and healthy everyone :)

Edit 1: For those having trouble accessing the link above, just Google ‚ÄúP90X archive.org‚Äù. If you use Bing, navigate to google.com and search for ‚ÄúP90X archive.org‚Äù.

Edit 2: [Insanity](https://archive.org/details/08MaxIntervalCircuit_201509), the more cardio oriented one, is on archive.org too, as well as the shorter [P90X3](https://archive.org/details/accelerator_202003).

Edit 3: For everyone asking if this is hard - yes, it will kick your ass. It will grind you down, especially if you‚Äôve never worked out before and try to keep up with Tony and his gang. 

BUT the beauty of P90X is that it allows you to go at your own pace. Modify the exercises. Do half the reps. Whatever it is that you do, just maintain consistency and don‚Äôt hurt yourself. It always gets easier.

Once the quarantine eases up, I hope to see you all come out of your home cocoons as jacked butterflies ü¶ã

Edit 4: So if people can stop sending me death threats for getting P90X taken off archive.org...that'll be great. 

Edit 5: Here's another source for P90x online --&gt; Google "P90X Index". Get it while it's still hot.

Edit 6: Lol the Navy Seals thing I posted is a copypasta - Y‚Äôall need to chill internet strangers. But I guess /s is necessary for anything that‚Äôs not obviously sarcastic.

Also look at my edits for other options that are still available for P90X. TLDR: Edit 5.
