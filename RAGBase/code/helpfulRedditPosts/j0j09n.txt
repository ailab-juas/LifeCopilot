LPT: If you take a picture of your infant or toddler and you see white instead of red-eye, run don’t walk to a pediatric optometrist.

Using my cake day to get the word out. At 7 months my daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma (a rare eye cancer). She is nearly 2yrs old and after 4 rounds of chemo the tumor in her eye is dead. She’s doing great. No sight in the eye, but they didn’t have to remove the eye. 

My wife saw a Facebook post years ago saying to look out for a yellow or white reflection. The white reflection doesn’t always mean cancer, but is never a good sign. If we hadn’t heard that was a thing, we may have ignored it. So, the more you know.
