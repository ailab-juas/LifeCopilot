LPT: Want to make friends at your school or workplace? Don't feed the urge to impress the people around you with your knowledge or skills. Just be thoughtful and considerate. Over time, people value and trust most those who care about them, and don't require a lot of mental energy to be around.

More to the LPT: we all have felt that tightening in the backs of our skull when we are exerting massive amounts of energy trying to be polite to someone even though we feel uncomfortable. We also know what it feels like to just be yourself, when you are around close friends or family.

No one wants to be around someone that takes up all our energy. We want to be around someone that puts us at ease. Among many, many other things, stress in relationships come from not understanding each other; our motives and purpose are not aligned. But when we empathize with someone by simply trying to be considerate of their feelings and whatever they are going through, we share in their struggles and connect with that person. When we share in someone's struggles, we become considerate and understanding of their situation. Not everyone, but many people, will come to appreciate you and will want to have you around because you make their life easier, not harder.

The last thing I want to add is that it's important to be genuine. Don't try to fake being considerate because someone going through something serious can tell who relates to them and who is just being "nice."
