LPT: If you’re browsing potential travel bookings (hotels, flights etc) but don’t end up booking right away, use a different device when you do decide to book.

This might be common knowledge but wasn’t for me, at 30 years old. My partner was searching hotels for one night in Toronto a few days ago. When he went to book the hotel tonight, his cell phone gave him the price of $222,  he logged on to my lap top and got it for $176. 

Question: is this was “cookies” do?
