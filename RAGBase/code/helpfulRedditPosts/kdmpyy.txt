LPT: Don’t schedule meetings outside of work hours. Even if you don’t mind working at 6am, you’re setting a standard for your peers &amp; business partners that everyone else will be forced to uphold

content:
I see this a lot in my industry. “I like working at 5am or 8pm. It’s not a problem right?”  No. It’s not if you’re just working. 

The problem becomes when you start scheduling meetings. 


For those of us in international business that means people in different time zones will start scheduling earlier and earlier because clearly it’s alright with you. They’ll come to assume that’s fine with your team and start scheduling meetings for everyone at 5am. 


When you are out of the office, your peers need to replace you on your 5am calls or 8pm calls. 


People do not like their work life balance interrupted. That is a really quick way to be deemed inconsiderate &amp; become disliked on your team.


***Edit: I’m NOT talking about time zones where it’s impossible to meet without it being at a shitty hour (ie India and San Francisco). I’m specifically talking about instances where there are overlapping hours WITHIN the business day for BOTH time zones.
