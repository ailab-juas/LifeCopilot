LPT: Don't promise when you are happy, don't reply when you are angry, and don't decide when you are sad.

I came across this quote and found it to be something worth thinking about or considering. I’m sure there might be exceptions to this, but overall it is probably better to not make important decisions when you’re in a highly emotional state.

Edit: Thank you for the awards!!! I also wanted to mention that as humans, it is completely normal for us to have a variety of emotions. But if we take a second to realize and become self-aware of these emotions, it can possibly help prevent situations where we say things that we regret or things that can hurt others. Sometimes it can be beneficial to take a step back from the situation and rethink it instead of immediately reacting on your emotions.
