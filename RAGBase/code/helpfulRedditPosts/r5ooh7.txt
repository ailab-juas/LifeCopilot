YSK: Houseplants go dormant in winter, so reduce your watering.

content:
Why YSK: As the cold weather slows down their metabolic rate, plants will require water less frequently than in the summer. It is important to not overwater your houseplants as they can grow mold, mildew, or be susceptible to fungus and other diseases with excessive water. 

A good rule of thumb is to touch the soil with your finger to see if the substrate is moist, and avoid watering again until it is dry. 

Also, leaf tips can go brown from cold. Do not cut these off until warmer weather arrives, as this is one of the plantâ€™s protection against frost. They essentially write off a part of themselves to take the damage from the cold in order to protect the rest of them. 

Good luck, and happy gardening!
