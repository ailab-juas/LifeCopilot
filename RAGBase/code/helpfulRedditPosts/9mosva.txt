LPT: Glow Sticks are a safe cheap light source when the power goes out. Stock up during Halloween when they are readily available everywhere, and half price the day after Halloween.

You can store glow sticks for a couple of years. I keep a stock in the emergency supplies and rotate them out when I buy fresh ones on clearance after Halloween. When the power is out, give one to every child to tuck under their pillow and one in the bathroom.  Flashlights are great, but the glow stick will help you find the flashlight.
