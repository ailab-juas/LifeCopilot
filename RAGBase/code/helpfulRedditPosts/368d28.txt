LPT: Active 2-Step Verification on your email account

content:
My email got hacked and my RuneScape account was hacked too.

They were able to change my recovery phone number and email so I can't get back on that email and I have lost the RS account because they have changed my passwords.

Luckily that email was a random email I made for RS and it was only used to make the account and had no other stuff on it.

This is the second time I have had an email hacked. Making a new long password is not enough people! It look me 5 minutes at most to active the 2-Step Verification on my Gmail and implement backup passwords and download the codes. I HIGHLY recommend it because it should really protect your email.

Here is a link to do it on Google: https://www.google.com/landing/2step/

Trust me. It will take you a few minutes and will save you a lot of hassle in the future.

**DO IT!**
