LPT: Allow people the freedom to change. If someone decides to modify their beliefs or behaviors in a positive way, refrain from pointing out their inconsistencies, being sarcastic, joking, or otherwise commenting.

If someone changes their mind and behaviors over time, it’s more likely a sign of correcting errors in premature decision-making or undoing bad habits. As life goes on, people gain more experience, perspective, and information to make better, well-informed decisions. Change is a sign of growth so it’s best to be supportive throughout that process.
