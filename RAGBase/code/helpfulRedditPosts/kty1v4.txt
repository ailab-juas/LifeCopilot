LPT - USA - If you work an average of 30 hours a week, or 130 hours a month, you are entitled to full-time benefits. Do not let companies lie to you. You can contact your local Bureau of Labor and Industry to file a complaint and they will help you. You cannot be fired for this.

According to the [IRS Website](https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/employers/identifying-full-time-employees#:%7E:text=For%20purposes%20of%20the%20employer,The%20monthly%20measurement%20method%2C%20and). 

"For purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, a full-time employee is, for a calendar month, an employee employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week, or 130 hours of service per month."

So, if your company is scheduling you 39 hours a week and refusing to give you benefits, they have been wrong and you are entitled to all of the back benefits and pay. 

While you cannot be fired for contacting the BOLI, the company will almost certainly not be happy. And if you live in an at-will state, chances are they will find a reason to fire you later on. 

So if you do this, make sure to talk to all of the fellow employees and tell them, and tell them your wages, as that is not illegal in the US either.

As always, I am just a dude on reddit, contact a lawyer before making any moves, your mileage may vary, etc. 

This info is not complete so reach out to a lawyer or labor professional (not HR) if you think there is an issue with your hours.
