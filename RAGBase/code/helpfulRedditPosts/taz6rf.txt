LPT: If you find a pair of pants you like, buy multiple of them!

content:
4 years ago I found an amazing fitting pair of pants and I bought 6 pairs of them, 2 of each colors. And I pull a new one out each year when I think the other one is getting faded or old. So refreshing not having to worry about finding pants that fit and are the right color and feel good!!


Same goes with underwear and socks. I have stocked up and havenâ€™t had to think about these for the past 2 years.

Edit: My pants brand was Topman before they shut down their east coast presence :/ glad I stocked up! 

Edit: thank you for the award!
