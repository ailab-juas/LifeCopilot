LPT: College students: At the start of every semester, use the syllabus from each class to fill in a calendar or day planner for the entire semester.

content:
Using each syllabus, extract the date that every assignment, quiz, test, paper or project is due for each class. Fill in your calendar or day planner with this information, making sure to list everything that is due each day, for each class, for the whole semester.

By doing this, you will prevent yourself from being blindsided by deadlines. I fill out a new wall calendar with all of this information at the start of each semester and it has helped me tremendously. Wall calendars are generally inexpensive and will cost you less than $5. 

Whether they are quizzes, exams, or even which chapters need to be read before each class, having a weekly template of what you need to accomplish or prepare for will set you up for success.

I recommend using pencil, as some professors will change the dates of things due to the pace of the course or weather interruptions. This has helped me be a better student, and I hope that it may help some of you!

Edit: Thank you for the feedback about electronic scheduling. It seems like a great option as it can be taken with you wherever you go, and updated on the fly. I will likely start doing this too. The point of this post is to help students become more organized and aware of their academic responsibilities, as not everyone uses these tools. I used to fly by the seat of my pants, and noticed a big difference in my success when I began doing this.
