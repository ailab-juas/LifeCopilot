LPT: Need to know if a woman is just big or pregnant? Just ask," Do you have any kids?". This has given me the answer 95% of the time.

content:
I always tell people if they really need to know just ask," Do you have any kids?". If she's pregnant the answer will always almost be along the lines of "Oh not yet, but I'm expecting"..."I already have x kids and another one one the way." If she just answers no then don't ever bring it up.  
Honestly though, if you don't NEED to know I wouldn't ask unless you know for a fact they won't be insulted.  
Personally, I wouldn't care if someone asked me straight out.
