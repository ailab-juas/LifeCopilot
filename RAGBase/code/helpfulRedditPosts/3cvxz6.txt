title:
[LPT] Use a pizza slicer to cut up your kids pancakes for them, it saves time, makes for a smaller mess and they love watching.

content:
Edit 1: kids' (Dear God so sorry.... the shame....)


Edit 2: If you don't get this, then you either don't have kids or they have never been late getting to the table before the bus arrives

Edit 3: Use slicer before you apply syrup and cleaning the slicer is trivial

Edit 4: As for kids liking it, it is probably because kids like tools and a tool that applies to their morning is fun to watch in use. 

Edit 5: Why it makes less mess. It is far less mess than them cutting their own for sure, but also, the precision  squares fit perfectly on their forks and in their mouths, which means less syrup on the table and faster from plate to tummy. Basic manufacturing technique, reduce variation for faster assembly line and fewer mistakes during the manufacturing process. 

Edit 6: Non-stop negative private messages in my inbox are  offensive. I have given this advice to many families with lots of kids and many have appreciated it enough to thank me for it years later. It is so helpful on chaotic mornings where every second counts, and you make the dicing fun so the kids have a smile on their faces before going out for their hard day!

Final Edit: Was an honor to make at the top of LPT yesterday, thank you everyone that sent your positive feedback!! My faith in Reddit has been restored :)
