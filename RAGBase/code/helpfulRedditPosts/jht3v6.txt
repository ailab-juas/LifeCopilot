YSK: The best time to buy a fire extinguisher was yesterday

content:
Why YSK: Started a kitchen fire yesterday after our kitchen towels caught on fire and it quickly escalated into something that we were unable to deal with on our own. Had we not had a fire extinguisher, I’m pretty sure our kitchen if not our whole apartment would have burned.

Do yourself a huge favor and buy a fire extinguisher now if you don’t have one.
