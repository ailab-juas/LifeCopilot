LPT: If your SO has a Pinterest account, its like a wish list for gifts.

content:
If you've got no idea what to buy her go on her wall, and she's probably pinned shoes, jewelry, dresses, handbags and loads of stuff. Best thing is if you click on it, it'll take you straight to the website to purchase the item.If you go far back enough she may even forget she pinned it and just think you've got great taste! Even if you can't afford what she's pinned you are bound to be able to find something similar and cheaper.
