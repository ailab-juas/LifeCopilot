LPT: Looking back on my life, I've realised that almost every stressful situation I was in manifested from a lack of communication. Be brave and always say the thing you know you need to say, no matter who it's to or why.

Don't let anyone tell you that ghosting, cutting off, hinting, testing or being anything other than clear and up front is the way to go. It may be painful in the short term, but the knock on effects of avoiding communication are too long to list, and are always far worse than the initial discomfort.
