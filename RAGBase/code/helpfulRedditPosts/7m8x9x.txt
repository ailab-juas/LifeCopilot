YSK: Men, if you are ever visiting a hospital and need to poop, go to the OB/GYN offices. Their men’s rooms are rarely used and usually clean and quiet

content:
I’ve done marketing in hospitals for a long time now and I can attest that at each hospital in my area, those bathrooms at the OB/GYN offices that say men’s are the cleanest. Can’t speak for the communal bathrooms but I would steer clear of those. 

Edit: ok a few things:


A)Obviously not every hospital is going to be like this. I was referring to those hospitals that have obgyn outpatient clinics connected to them, which is pretty much every hospital in my city

B)a bunch of people must not have read where I put “men’s room”. 

C)no I don’t advocate being a pervert or even being creepy.
