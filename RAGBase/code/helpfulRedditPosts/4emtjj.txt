YSK Most states have voter information available publicly, which may make your current address available to the general public.

In Oregon, for example: all you need to find someone's current voter registration address is their first name, last name, and DOB. Name &amp; DOB are usually relatively easy to find online, even if you're careful. I'm guessing most states have the same (or similar) protocol. 

Most states will allow you to redact this from public record (in other words, only keep it in private records), but you typically need to fill out a separate form that lists why you need it to be confidential. 

*Edit: since some folks seem up in arms, this wasn't meant to be a scary OMG STALKERS STEALING YR ADDRESS!!111!!! post, I just thought people would want to know.*
