YSK how to make your own sports drink

YSalreadyK that it's much cheaper to fill up a bottle with tap water than to buy bottled water, but until I read/watched the info below, I hadn't thought of the same for sports drinks (ie. Gatorade).  Much, much cheaper and healthier, too.  It's so simple, easy and well, obvious now!

Chef John (my favorite cooking guide) wrote this post and made this video.

Blog post:  [Homemade Sports Drink â€“ Because Greaterade &gt; Gatorade](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2016/03/homemade-sports-drink-because.html)

And [here's the video where he shows you how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kehS5f3Fe5I)

but, basically, here's the recipe (I hope he doesn't mind, but check out his blog and video anyway, lots more info and options):

     Ingredients for about 9 cups of Greaterade:
     -you'll need to watch the video for the technique-
     8 cups fresh cold water
     3 tablespoons honey, or other sweetener to taste
     1/2 teaspoon fine *pink salt (mine was coarsely ground, so I used a rounded 1/2 teaspoon)
     3/4 teaspoon calcium magnesium powder 
     --(Chef John used: NOW Foods Cal-Mag Citrate)
     pinch cayenne
     3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
     2 lemons, juiced
     2 limes, juiced
