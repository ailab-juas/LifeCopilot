LPT: Donate old board games, books, puzzles, etc. to a local nursing home. There's a damn good chance that they will be well-used as well as helping someone stay a little sharper and more engaged.

Speaking as a guy who used to work in nursing homes, it was cool to see it when people donated stuff like this or the activity department provided it and residents actually used it.  Heck, even if they are an advanced dementia patient who maybe can't use it for it's intended use, yet happens to like the picture on the box and carries it around with them so they can keep looking at it, that's giving them mental/emotional stimulation and keeping them thinking.
