LPT: If you aren't able to keep a secret, chances are the person you tell it to can't either

Oh god my inbox. Help meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

EDIT: I like how \u\nonamebeats said this:

&gt;Same goes for stealing someone's girl/boyfriend. If they were willing to cheat on the last one...

This kind of thing really applies to any kind of thing like this (e.g a nice person is usually kind to most people; as such since the person was kind to that person. He will probably also be kind to the other person) basicly:

    A = 5
    A * B = 0
Therefore since A = 5 then B must equal 0
so that must mean ℝ* B = 0. (ℝ being a real number)
It's a logical assumption (I have no clue where I was going with this but I'm going to leave it here)

EDIT: A lot of people are complaining about this (oh well this is the internet what can you expect :P) so here is my reply to /u/PraetorianXVIII about it:

&gt;First off can you please calm down before answering this? It is hard to debate with someone while they are mad.

&gt;/u/GolfDaddyS asked me about evidence, so I answered it with this: 
&gt;&gt;I didn't use this to create this thread; but I suppose that it could fall under the [similarity attraction effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_attraction#Similarity_attraction_effect). Which says that similar people are attracted to one another. So this could mean that people who like to gossip, hang around people who like to gossip.  

&gt;You have a good point that it is common sense; but as my last one stated it's only common sense to the people who think before they act.

 &gt;An act before think person would talk about someone without ensuring they are there. While a think before act person would look around to make sure that person isn't there. Of course a think before act wouldn't talk about that person in the first place because this is common sense not to talk about someone. 

&gt;And please don't think that this applies to every single person. Of course some people won't tell others about their secrets. However what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't really expect them to keep the secret if your not keeping it (just a matter of wording; which I could of done better). 

&gt;Also is it not tiresome to supply data like this? I didn't really expect it to blow up I thought maybe 30 at max. You don't really expect the posts with no votes to have this kind of data. As such you shouldn't expect the posts with a lot of votes to have a lot of data (of course it would probably be added later (I should probably do that... lol)). 

&gt;Anyways; this is Reddit ;P if you don't really like a post please just downvote, negativity is never a good thing (unless your first goal in mind is to be humorous). 

&gt;signed OP


don't tell anyone but I suck at writing.
