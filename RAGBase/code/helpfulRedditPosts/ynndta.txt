LPT: Things that fire together, wire together.

content:
"Things that fire together, wire together" is perhaps the most famous saying about how our brains work, and rightfully so! 

**What it means:**

1. We excel at creating associations and patterns based on previous thoughts and experiences 

2. The more we repeat or revisit these connections, the more strongly wired (connected) they become. (Neural wiring is sometimes compared to a bridge that becomes bigger the more we walk on it.) 

3. This is true of all neural patterns, whether it's a physical habit or a mental one (belief patterns, negative thoughts, etc). 

**What *else* this means: If you have a dominant pattern or association that's no longer healthy / beneficial for you,**

1. You can build a new one 

2. When you start, the new association won't yet be as strongly "wired" as the older, better-established one, and thus it will be more difficult for it to "fire" - for that behavior to activate and feel natural. 

3. *This is true whether it's learning a new sport, brushing your teeth with your nondominant hand, or changing your beliefs.* 

4. If you put time and energy into building that new, more beneficial pattern, it will gradually become stronger as the older becomes weaker. *You have the ability to change your brain.* 

This is one of the healthiest things you can do for yourself, not only to get out of negative habits of life and thinking, but to remind yourself that you're not at the mercy of those patterns. 

Neuroplasticity is amazing. Brains are amazing. Go make some new connections!
