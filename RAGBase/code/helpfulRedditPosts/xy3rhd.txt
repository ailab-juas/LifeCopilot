LPT: Anytime you’re doing a home repair or project, have your kids help you out. That way they learn about home systems, doing things on their own and saving money in the process.

It’s also a great way to bond with your kids. We inevitably joke about the repair that we are doing, like “what a stupid design“, or “There are 1001 other things I’d rather be doing”. You just have to find a way of making it fun or interesting.
