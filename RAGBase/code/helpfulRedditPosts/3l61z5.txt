LPT: When accepting to give help to friends/family, be specific about time frames.

content:
People have different conceptions of what's acceptable to ask from others, especially concerning time.

Notable examples are:

- Can I stay at your home for x reason? 
- Can you help me doing x? 
- Can I borrow X? 

It's good idea to reply "Sure, for how long" to all of the above if you're willing to help.

My sister just moved out my house after a year of living for free with me. There was no previous negotiation about time frame. The whole family hates me now because my sister felt I was kicking her out when I asked "are you planning to move to your own place at some point?"

EDIT: thanks for the replies guys, I loved the stories! I'm glad to know that the world is full of abusers like my sister and I'm not alone! To those of you that said we got into these situations for not having people skills, I'll just say... 

... Oh, my sweet, sweet summer children.
