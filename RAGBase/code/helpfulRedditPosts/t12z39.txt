title:
YSK that there is an updated pain scale for when you’re needing medical attention

content:
Why YSK: because this is a more accurate way to relate pain, and it allows the person suffering to give a fairly objective estimate vs a number that is fairly subjective as everyone perceives pain differently.

Edit: I have chronic pancreatitis and it’s been helpful to have this pain scale to explain to medical staff how I feel. It’s absolutely maddening seeing people in the ER claim they have 10/10 pain while smiling and talking.
