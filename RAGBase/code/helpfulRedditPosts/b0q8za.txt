LPT: When buying a car at a dealership and they leave you alone to talk about it, check their desk phone speaker light. If it is on, they are most definitely listening to your conversation from the back office.

It happened to us when I bought my first used car at a VW dealership. We were discussing the sale price and he left us to "talk about it" while he went to "run some numbers" by the finance manager. I had given an offer of $1000 below their asking price as that is what I could afford. My mother said she could chip in $500 more if that would help me out. 

He came back and said his "boss" could meet in the middle, $500 off sale price.  We were quite happy about it all and it was done.

Later on I got an office job with the exact same phones the dealership had. Found out the green light button was lit when the phone was active, and the microphone on.
