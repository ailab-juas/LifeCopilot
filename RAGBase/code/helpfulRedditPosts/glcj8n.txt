YSK: Time invested in a relationship isn't a good reason to NOT leave

content:
Just because you have been with someone for what may be a considerable length of time doesn't mean you shouldn't leave. If a person is being abusive, the relationship has changed, or if you're simply not happy, just leave. If you've worked to remedy the problem and it isn't working, it's okay to leave. And it's okay to feel like you're starting over and it's going to hurt. It's going to feel like a complete waste of time. Thats fine. Use it as a learning experience for self growth. 

Source: Left a relationship of 8 years and didn't want to be in it for at least 2 years. Best decision of my life was to leave.
