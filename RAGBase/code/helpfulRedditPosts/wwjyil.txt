title:
YSK that you’re most likely using your microwave wrong

content:
Almost everyone I know uses their microwave improperly. Most people put the food in, set a time, and let it heat up. They then proceed to complain about the edges being too hot and the middle too cold or some other variation of their food not being heated right. That is because a microwave is actually a microwave OVEN, and similar to your regular oven, you can’t just put it on full blast. If you wanted to bake cookies you don’t set your oven to 600 degrees and hope for the best, right? No! You set it to a specific temperature and time. Use your microwave the same way. Adjust the power level and up the time you leave your food in there. I adjust the power level for any and every thing I would normally put in the microwave for more than a minute. This will help your food heat up more evenly and leave you more satisfied with your microwave! 

Why YSK? This is a super easy setting adjustment that will leave you feeling more satisfied and without scars on your fingers from a hot bowl but cold soup.
