LPT: Never give donations through corporations like Walmart, donate directly to places after research.

content:
You're at the self checkout lane, and a pop up shows on your screen to round up to a dollar to help this or that. Do not donate this way, this is a manipulation tactic to make you feel bad and make a quick, seamlessly harmless decision to donate through a corporation. (EDIT)T̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶m̶o̶n̶e̶y̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶a̶t̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶r̶e̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶a̶x̶ ̶b̶r̶e̶a̶k̶s̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶g̶i̶v̶e̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶r̶p̶o̶r̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶.̶  This is a PR tactic to show an interest in philanthropy, getting customers to feel involved in something, while looking good for the corporation. This corporation is wanting to look like it cares for sick children, while lobbying against better healthcare, and not giving the low wage employees reasonable plans. This corporation has plenty of its own money already, while paying minimum wage, or slightly more, still poor wages, you do not need to give the corporation any more money. With this information in hand, you do not have to feel bad saying or clicking no. Consider making donations to charities directly after research. Make sure you are making informed decisions, and look out for devious manipulation tactics.
