LPT: When handing someone both cash and coin, hand them the coins first and then the bills.

content:
This allows for the best grip on the loose change and prevents the coin sliding off of the bills.

Edit: I work as a cashier at a landfill. All my customers pay from their cars, its easier to hand them their coins since they're reaching out at awkward angles.Some of you guys are wayyyyy too passionate about this.
