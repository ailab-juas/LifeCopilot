YSK: Be interested, not interesting

Why YSK:

I was working at an event for a major hotel chain and it was a training class for people moving up the career tract for the chain. They kept drilling this idea “Be interested, no interesting,” when engaging patrons in conversation in their business. 

It seems obvious but I believe it’s a really good idea we should all use when engaging people on conversation, especially new people we meet. I feel as though, to an extent, the “art” of having a conversation is being lost. A lot of the times we are good at talking about ourselves but seldom ask questions of the other person and engage that person. 

I know when I’ve had this done to me, I feel more heard and valued. I think it’s a good take away for all of us.
