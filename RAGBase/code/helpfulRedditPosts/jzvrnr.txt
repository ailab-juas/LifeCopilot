title:
YSK that it's best not to give food to the food bank this Holiday Season (or ever)

content:
Why YSK: Food banks have various partnerships that allow them to get *way* more food per dollar than you can. The two food banks I checked in my area both say they can get $5 worth of food for every $1 donated.

This means that $20 turns into an even $100 worth of food. (I chose $100 since that's generally a good benchmark for the bare minimum to feed an adult reasonably nutritious food for a month... Or so I've heard.)

YS also K that monthly donations are much better than lump-sum donations. Food banks go through feast and famine phases every year. 'Tis the Season for Giving right now, with lots of big corporate and private donation drives. But, by the fall, food banks are often rather bare. By signing up for a regular monthly donation, even if it's the same total $ amount, food banks can more steadily meet the demands for their services.

With American Thanksgiving kicking off annual food drives around the Western world right now.... Please consider setting up an automatic monetary contribution this year instead of bringing in a bag of cans!

Edit: and I forgot to add that the food bank knows best what they currently need, too, so you can be 100% confident they will spend the money on what's most needed.

Edit 2: Of course, the title shouldn't be taken literally. Every donation helps, and kids specifically learn best by giving physical goods.
