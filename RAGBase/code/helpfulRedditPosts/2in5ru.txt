LPT: During winter, keep a spare pair of socks in your car's glove-box...but not for the reason you think

content:
I posted in another thread about 'poor kid' experiences, and this one came back to me. 

We had a sucky car when I was younger, and it needed to be push-started quite a lot. When it snowed, there was no traction and this was a nightmare! 

Over the years, the best impromptu traction-improving method I found, was to put a pair of socks *over* your shoes. 

Not wanting to go sock-less and cold for the rest of the day/journey, I took to keeping a spare pair of socks in the glove-box for just this reason. 

I don't know the science behind it, but it makes it *much* easier to get a push on, on a car in snow. 

It's a fairly downside-less tip. Socks are cheap, and compact, cars are heavy, and spare socks are always useful. Plus they're convenient as a makeshift screen/mirror cloth in a pinch. All round a pretty painless measure to take.
