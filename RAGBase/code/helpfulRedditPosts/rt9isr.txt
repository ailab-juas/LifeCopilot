LPT Ubers are cheaper than DUIs, and funerals. Stay safe out there, happy New Year's.

If you plan to party, have a planned out ride or safe way to sleep it off.

I'm no saint, I've spent more than a few evenings sleeping in my car to sober up.

If you plan to ever sleep in your car, have a blanket and a few insulating jackets handy. Also, a beanie is great to block out the light and some noise.

When you wake up, drink water and get out of your car to walk around for a second to make sure your equilibrium has entirely returned. If it has, you can safely drive home.

**Edit: I don't support Uber or Lyft explicitly, i just want a safer New Years.**

Many are saying cabs can be cheaper on holidays, and considering these price surges from the ride sharing apps.. Uber and Lyft should instead be offering discounts, if anything, on nights like this.

That being said, please still tip well, it's your driver's holiday too.

It's also really endearing to hear about Coors' and AAA Insurance's free ride services for tonight. All these programs I'd be oblivious to without your comments. Thank you all, please take care.

**Edit 2:** For all those saying this post is common sense, yes, "don't drink and drive" is common sense. Although not common enough imo.

However, perciving the perspective that an even an $800 Lyft could cost less than a DUI, (I'm hoping) could possibly make at least one person think twice before deciding to write off the safer options of getting home tonight.
