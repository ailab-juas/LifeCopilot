LPT: If you have thicker facial hair, let your shaving cream sit on your face for 1-2 minutes before shaving.  The cream will soften the hair and make it much easier to get off cleanly.

I usually just lather my shaving cream on and go at it, but if I've been lazy for a few days and have a lot of stubble I'll wet my face, apply the shaving cream and let it sit for a couple minutes before shaving.  It softens your hair and make the hair come off much easier as well as saving your skin from irritation.  A couple minutes of set time makes a HUGE difference.  Try it if you don't already!
