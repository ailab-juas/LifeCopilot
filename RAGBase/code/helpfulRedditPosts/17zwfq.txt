LPT: When filming a video with your phone at a concert, put a finger over where the sound is picked up.

For instance, on an iPhone, cover the bottom of your phone with your finger/hand. This keeps the sound muffled, but it sounds a lot clearer when you play it back later. This works great for loud concerts.
