LPT: If you are dropping somebody off at their home, make sure that they are able to get in before you drive away.

It is common sense but most people don't have the patience to wait to make sure who they are dropping off are safely inside. It only struck me today when I was dropped off and the friend drove off and I didn't have the key to get inside. Just had to sit on my porch for two hours waiting for my parents to come home from their shopping trip.
