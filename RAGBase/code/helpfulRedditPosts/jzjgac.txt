YSK vegan leather is just another way to say pleather, and it's NOT environmentally friendly at all.

Buying vegan leather is not an environmentally friendly option, even compared to real leather... which is an uncomfortable reality. It's just crappy plastic at a premium. Producers used the word "vegan" to their advantage to guilt people into thinking that purchasing their product is an "ethically minded" and "environmentally conscious" decision. But they aren't making the environment better at all.

Faux leathers consist of a knitted polyester base with a PVC or polyurethane coating and are also usually manufactured from fossil fuels and take a *long time* to break down once they reach the end of their useful life (which is a lot shorter than leather products, since leather looks better with age). Additionally, leather products are biodegradable wheras PVC takes significantly longer to break down in the landfill.

You go from one industry which is traditionally based on skins that come from the meat industry to another industry that's heavily dependent on petrochemicals. Both are arguably damaging to animal habitats, animal life and the future of this planet.

Why YSK: This doesn't mean eating green is useless, on the contrary, its a great idea both for environment, animals and the well being of humans.... but buying vegan leather certainly is an ineffective way to apply vegan ethics to your life.
