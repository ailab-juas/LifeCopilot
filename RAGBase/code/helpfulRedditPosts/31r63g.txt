[LPT] Quickly Estimate A Yearly Salary From Hourly Pay!

content:
  
Step 1.) Take hourly pay (i.e., $Y/hr)  
Step 2.) Double hourly pay (i.e., $Y/hr x 2 = $Z)  
Step 3.) Add three zeros to the result of "Step 2.)" (i.e.,  $Z x 1000 = Estimated Yearly Salary).    

In short, this is the "hourly pay" multiplied by 2000. But, by following the above-mentioned steps one can **mentally** arrive to an **estimated salary** from the "hourly pay" with little effort or additional resources.

**ASSUMPTIONS FOR THIS ESTIMATION:**  
* You work 40 hours per week   
* You only get paid for 50 weeks out of a calendar year.  
*It should be understood that, basic arithmetic can be performed to obtain a more accurate figure for a yearly salary.  This post's focus is implementing a generalized, easily calculable, estimation method to obtain a ballpark figure for a yearly salary.*

For example: $14/hr (hourly pay) --&gt; $28 (doubling hourly pay) --&gt; $28,000 (adding three zeros).  This means someone who makes $14/hr before tax will earn *roughly* $28,000 over the course of the year, before tax.  
  
  
  
Tl;dr (courtesy of /u/geohump):   
Double the hourly rate: $14/hr -&gt; $28/hr  
Add a "K/year": $28K/year
