LPT: If your work's Paid Time Off arrangement allows it, and especially if your company offers unlimited PTO, take some random middle-of-the-week days off every once in a while. Go on a day trip, run some errands, or just sit at home and be unproductive for a day or two. Makes a world of difference.
