LPT: When travelling in poor countries bring a Polaroid Camera to take a picture to leave with the people there.

content:
The idea is to offer to leave a picture from the Polaroid camera if you can take your own pictures with your digital.

I find that people are much happier about getting their picture taken if you are able to leave them with something unique.  Often times it is the only picture they have of themselves!

[Here are some examples](http://imgur.com/a/HWvYM) of pictures that I have been able to take because I offered a copy to them.

EDIT: These are from Senegal and Gambia in 2004.  I have also done this in Morocco and Peru.  It has been pointed out that Polaroid film is expensive now, I would add that the cameras are also very bulky.  There are some great modern alternatives in the comments!
