LPT: Don't tell people you're "thinking of doing something." Only tell them after you've done it.

content:
I realized that I have lots of ideas for things I should do, and I have a tendency to mention these to friends and family.

Someone recently commented that I never finish anything, and while I do have a procrastination problem with some things (like decorating my home), I realized that a lot of this perception is from me saying a lot of things that I may not have been serious about, but mentioned.  So when they see me *not* doing it, it makes it seem like I never finish anything when in reality I probably didn't even start.

By telling people when you've done something, it gives the appearance that you get stuff done and make progress.

It can be a hard habit to break if you love sharing your "what if" ideas, but by not doing it, you'll craft a better image for yourself.
