LPT: How to destroy memories, like getting that annoying song out of your head

Abstract: An unwanted mind pattern can be removed using a simple method: Corrupt the pattern. 

Background: 

The human mind is good at learning patterns and lessons. This has helped ensure survival. This mechanism causes problems when the distinct pattern of a catchy song or the memory of a painful or embarrassing experience gets stuck in your brain like a leech in a place you can't reach. 

A memory is not like a digital video that remains the same no matter how many times you play it. Rather, a memory WRITES OVER ITSELF each time you re-experience it in your mind. Memories are UNSTABLE, and there have been studies in which false memories containing events that never happened into subjects' minds. You can exploit the instability of memories by repeatedly rewriting over the unwanted memory, until the original loses all meaning, context, and structure, rendering it inert if not deleted.

Process for deleting an unwanted brain/earworm:

* Replay the memory, pattern, song progressively mess it up by adding, changing details, pace, exaggerations, distortions. Make it funny, strange, surreal. 
* It is important to STRONGLY experience the distortions in your mind and and associate them directly with the memory.
* Do this repeatedly, CHANGING the pattern each time. Increase the intensity of the distortions with each subsequent repetition, until the original pattern becomes scrambled. 
* The beginning of the pattern is hardest to scramble. It is like the start of the path to the memory. When the original pattern is scrambled, you can set the path from the beginning of the pattern to lead it to a more desired outcome.
* Avoid reminders or things that will re-establish original unwanted memory.


Example: You want to forget "Call Me Maybe"

* Replay and change lyrics, tempo, key, context: "Hey, I just m... ight eat a potato, or maybe a banana...", "Hey, I just aaaaaaaate a pooootaaato...", ... "Hey, I like chicken, I like liver, Meomix...", ... "Hay, the horse likes hay..."
* Strongly experience means you have to sing or mouth the new songs. Sing as differently from the original pattern as possible.
* Enough repetitions will unhook that earworm.
* Now you might still have "Hey", the beginning of the path. Now you can think about another song that begins with "Hey"
* Avoid listening to the original song.

**EDIT:** 

How easy this is will vary based on the memory you choose to corrupt. A fresh memory of some faux pas or some recently-heard commercial jingle would be relatively easy to get rid of. Others are mental scars set deep in your long term memories that are near-impossible to wipe, due to your mind anchoring them to different contexts, emotions, and other memories. While it is hard to destroy something so deep, this technique WILL at least soften the impact and blur the harshness of the memory, with enough persistent repetition across long periods of time and upon each willing or spontaneous recall. Over time you can expect the memory to be more and more muddled.

* REPETITION is key. It's unreasonable to expect to erase a persistent brain pattern in under 4 reps. 10 reps recommended, but you should know when it's working.
* FOCUS is key. You must focus on EXPERIENCING EACH NEW DISTORTION so that your mind writes over the old pattern.
* DISTORTION is key. You must make each and every subsequent distortion weirder, stronger, and more ridiculous. If you recall any part of the original pattern in your later repetition, you need to distort harder.
* This is a mind exercise. You only get stronger and more successful if you keep doing it. If you try once or not at all and then give up, you know it's your own fault when you get that worm stuck in your head.
