YSK - Most credit cards have a number of benefits that very few people take advantage of including extended manufacturer warranties, free insurance on rental cars, theft reimbursement, roadside assistance, and much more.

content:
EDIT: Obviously all these benefits vary depending on card and issuer... your card may not have all these benefits so be sure to google what your card offers. 

Common benefits: 

* Your phone broke just outside of warranty? Get it repaired and submit the proper paperwork and your credit card company will cut you a check. 

* Renting a car? Decline the optional insurance, you are covered through your credit card.

* Car broke down but don't have AAA? They have you covered (for a small fee).

* Your luggage lost or damaged by an airline? Get a check.

* Bought something and then found it later online for less? Get refunded the difference.
