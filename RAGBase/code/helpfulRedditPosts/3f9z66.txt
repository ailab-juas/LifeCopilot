title:
LPT: Going to a party? Carry a lighter and a keychain bottle opener

content:
A light addition to your pocket that's a great way to start conversations with (and seem cool and capable to) the people who will invariably need them, even if you aren't smoking or drinking. Good advice for pubs, too, or really anywhere.

Anything else you've found to be a useful "loaner" accessory? A Swiss army knife might also be good...

EDIT: Okay, you can open a bottle with a lighter, TIL. @(u_u) "LifeProTips, where OP goes to get corrected." Thanks!
