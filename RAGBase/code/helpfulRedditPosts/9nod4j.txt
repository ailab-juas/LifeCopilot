With cold and flu season coming up it is important to know how to properly cover your cough or sneeze (it may not be as common knowledge as you think!)   All too often people cough directly into their hands and inadvertently spread germs when they touch things.  I see it on a regular basis and was even hollered at by a gentleman to "cover your cough!" when I coughed into my arm instead of my hand.  Even if you already know this you can help prevent the spread of germs by politely informing someone the proper way to cover a cough if you are around a person who coughs into his or her hand.
