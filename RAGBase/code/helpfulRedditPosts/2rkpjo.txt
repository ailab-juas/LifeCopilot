title:
YSK that deodorants are apparently more effective when you apply them at night

content:
The other day a pharmacist told me that deodorants are actually only really effective if you apply them at night because at that time the pores aren't as active as during the day and therefore more receptive fore the deodorant. 

Also it doesn't matter if you shower the morning after since by that time the pores are already plugged, which should hold up to at least 24 h. 

Here are some articles I could find about that topic in the internet:
