YSK that spending lots of time on the toilet (eg. redditing) can lead to hemorrhoids

content:
Hemorrhoids are enlarged blood vessels in your rectum. They can be itchy, sore, difficult to clean, and an all around pain in the ass. Getting them could also result in a doctor shoving various things up your ass which I rate 0/10 would not recommend.

Constipation and excessive pushing during poops also contributes to their formation.
