LPT: If you tell someone you need to talk to them, for the love of God give some indication of what you need to talk about, or at least that it's not bad news

Does this really need an explanation? Is this really a pro tip? This seems like basic fucking decency. I guarantee you that nobody has ever heard the sentence "we need to talk" and immediately assumed that there was a change in the household's popsicle policies. Just say, fuckin', "We need to talk about our popsicle policies later," not "I have something I need to discuss with you." How goddamn important is each and every second of your life that you can't spare a couple extra words to make sure your conversation partner doesn't spend the next few hours freaking out that you're divorcing them or have to put the dog down or whatever.
