LPT: Always get a receipt from getting gas. That way if something goes wrong, you have timestamped proof you were there to make things easier

content:
Just saw an article in my area that a gas station ended up giving people gas with water in it and it messed up all their tanks and they had to make insurance claims for repair and get reimbursed by the gas station eventually.

In the article, a representative of some authority suggested this LPT in case something like this happens to you, so I wanted to spread it a bit wider than just my state.

Edit: does my credit card log the transaction for me so I don’t have to save the receipt? I couldn’t tell from the 300+ comments saying this was a stupid LPT. Please feel free to send me another notification about how terrible this was. You’re very original
