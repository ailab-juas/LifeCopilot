YSK about scholarpedia, a peer-reviewed version of wikipedia. Every article is "curated" by an expert in the field AND it's legitimate to cite in an essay!

www.scholarpedia.com

EDIT: some of you are claiming that scholarpedia is not a legitimate source to cite. I'm going to address some of the concerns raised.

* *Scholarpedia is not an academic journal*

Scholarpedia publishes a journal. Articles are cited in the same format as any other scientific journal. That being said, it is not as large or reputable as other journals, which may be a problem for some people.

* *Scholarpedia is still an encyclopedia, so it's a tertiary source and not acceptable to cite in most papers*

Scholarpedia is a scientific encyclopedia, and in scientific disciplines, the distinction between secondary and tertiary is relative. "Depending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a bibliography, dictionary, or encyclopedia as either a tertiary or a secondary source."
