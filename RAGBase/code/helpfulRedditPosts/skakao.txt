LPT: Find some really comfortable socks, and buy a lot of them.

content:
 

Go to the store and buy 4 or 5 packs of promising looking socks... within a month or two, it will be obvious which socks you want to wear... you'll be disappointed when you open your sock drawer and you're out of them.

Now go back to the store and buy a bunch of those socks (I just bought 36 pairs). Since they're all identical, any sock will match with any other sock, so making pairs while you're putting away laundry is easier. Lost socks are not an issue any more. And, wearing really great socks every day will make your feet more comfortable and your days more enjoyable. The difference is significant.
