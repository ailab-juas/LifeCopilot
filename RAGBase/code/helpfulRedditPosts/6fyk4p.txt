title:
LPT: Always make your dog sit before feeding or giving them a treat. I mean every time. Every. Single. Time.

content:
After a while, the dog will just sit any time you bring out food. It will be automatic. You will never have that "trouble dog" that is always jumping on people and trying to steal their food.

Every time you bring food out, your dog will be sitting there like the beautiful little angel you always thought they could be. So simple yet so effective.
