LPT: Avoid pets and children from opening off-limit doors by turning the handle upside down, resulting in a pull up instead of push down.

content:
Lots of people seem to think this is impossible, it isn't and has worked for lots of people. The idea is to not have to install a lock as it is only generally a tempory measure, for example while the kids are too young to be taught to leave their room at night. 
Oh and here in the UK/Europe we primarily use handles not knobs, and in my experience ones that only open when pushed down - this may have changed in recent years but not to my knowledge. 
When it is done the handle does not stick out irregularly towards the door frame, it lies it the same direction, simply upside down.
