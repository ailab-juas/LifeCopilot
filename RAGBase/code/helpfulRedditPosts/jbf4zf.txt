title:
YSK cotton gloves and hand lotion are great to help restore dry or cracked skin on your hands

content:
Why YSK: If you apply some hand lotion or aquaphor to your hands and wear cotton gloves overnight or while you sleep it does wonders for your skin. This is good to do as winter approaches and dries out your skin and we are already washing our hands a lot more which is another factor. I have brought back cracking/bleeding skin to normal within 2 days using this treatment.
