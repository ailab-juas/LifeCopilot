title:
LPT: If you have small children who are starting to walk, decide NOW what items are precious to you and you absolutely cannot lose/replace and do not ever let them get near them, no matter how much they beg. Kids up to at least teenage years will VERY likely destroy anything they get their hands on.

content:
This is not about not trusting your kids or whatever, it's about setting boundaries and protecting things you value, which may be irreplaceable. The plain fact is most young kids are not built to appreciate the value of things, and you may be feeling kind-hearted and let them play with your old record-player and vinyl collection, or whatever, but until you are able to teach them to do so, they will not look after stuff, they WILL damage, neglect or destroy it, it's just the way it is. You have to decide now what items you draw the line at, because afterwards it will be too late and you will regret it. Source: have been a kid, and also have kids now.
