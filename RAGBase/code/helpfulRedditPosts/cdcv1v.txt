title:
YSK the difference between the word "disinterested" and "uninterested"

content:
I've been seeing a bunch of people on reddit using the word "disinterested/disinteresting" when they really mean "uninterested/uninteresting". While "uninterested" means exactly what it sounds like, that you are just not interested in something, "disinterested" means that you are impartial and non-biased. An umpire should be disinterested in the outcome of a baseball game, while you may be uninterested about the outcome of the game if you just find it to be kind of boring.
