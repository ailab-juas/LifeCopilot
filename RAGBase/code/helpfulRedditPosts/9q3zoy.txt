LPT: If you are on a calorically restricted diet make sure to eat before going to supermarket to buy food.

content:
While on a diet, our hunger goes through the roof so to avoid binge buying donuts, ice cream, bacon, etc. Make yourself a favor and eat before going to the supermarket.

Example: Be me, 4 weeks into my cut, didn't eat breakfast to save time and went to the supermarket, picked up the veggies I need, glanced at the donuts and various snacks, 404 error: will power not found, bought the donuts.
