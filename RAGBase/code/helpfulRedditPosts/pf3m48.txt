YSK Your early attachment style can significantly affect how you cope with stress and regulate your emotions as an adult

content:
**Why YSK:** Because it can help shed light on some possible reasons why you feel, think or behave in a particular way. An explanation like this can be quite powerful in that it can make you aware of the circumstances that shape who you become, especially if you’re the kind of person who thinks their character is all their fault. It’s also valuable for parents to know how their interactions with their kids can become neurally embedded and affect the children’s later life.

None of this is about assigning blame to parents or rejecting personal responsibility. It’s also not something I read in a self-help book or some such. Attachment theory has been backed by a lot of research in psychology and has inspired some of the most forward-thinking studies in neuroscience, too. Below I’ll sum up some findings from two decades of research by psychologist Mario Miculincer - and [here’s a link](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario-Mikulincer/publication/285623488_The_Attachment_Behavioral_System_In_Adulthood_Activation_Psychodynamics_And_Interpersonal_Processes/links/573d709808ae298602e5a533/The-Attachment-Behavioral-System-In-Adulthood-Activation-Psychodynamics-And-Interpersonal-Processes.pdf) with an in-depth (100 pages) report on his research.

OK, here we go:

Firstly, according to attachment theory, children of sensitive parents develop secure attachment. They learn to be okay with negative feelings, ask others for help, and trust their own ability to deal with stress.

By contrast, children of unresponsive caregivers can become insecurely attached. They get **anxious** and upset by the smallest sign of separation from their attachment figure. Harsh or dismissive parenting can lead to **avoidant** infants who suppress their emotions and deal with stress alone.  


Finally, children with abusive caregivers become **disorganized**: they switch between avoidant and anxious coping, engage in odd behaviours and often self-harm. 

Interactions with early attachment figures become neurally encoded and can be subconsciously activated later in life, especially in stressful and intimate situations.  For example, as adults, anxious people often develop low self-esteem and are easily overwhelmed by negative emotions. They also tend to exaggerate threats and doubt their ability to deal with them. Such people often exhibit a desperate need for safety and seek to “merge” with their partners. They can also become suspicious, jealous or angry without objective cause.

Avoidant people want distance and control. They detach from strong emotions (both positive and negative), and avoid conflicts and intimacy. Their self-reliance means that they see themselves as strong and independent, but this can mean that their close relationships remain superficial, distant and unsatisfying. And while being emotionally numb can help avoidant people during ordinary challenges, in the midst of a crisis, their defences can crumble and leave them extremely vulnerable.
