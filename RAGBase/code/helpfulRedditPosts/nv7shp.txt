LPT: If your dog gets out, or you see a dog who is running from its owner, instead of chasing it, crouch down with open arms and call to the dog. If you are chasing it, the dog will think you are playing a game.

I’ve used this on my own dogs, and helped strangers who have been chasing their own dog. Use this tip and you’ll (hopefully) never have to deal with the agony of running after your dog in panic. If you’re chasing a dog, it definitely thinks you are playing a game. Honestly I don’t know the psychology of it but crouching down like you want to greet them will make them come to you!

Edit: lots of great advice in the comments. Alternatives to crouching down: opening car door, laying/falling down, and running the other way so they chase you. And sure this might not work for every single dog, but I think it definitely works for the majority! Might as well try it before commencing the panic chase.
