title:
YSK if your dog plays "catch me if you can" games, you should run the opposite way rather than chasing them

content:
This is totally a game to them. You can win by just playing along. It helps if you act excited and into the experience. Chase them a little bit and let them have the delight of getting away a little bit, then eagerly dash off in the other direction. The dog will think you're taking turns and it's their turn to chase you and will run right up to you.

It doesn't always work, some dogs behave like this because they just don't want someone else to be the boss of them. If they get leery of being caught in general this probably won't fix that problem. But especially if it feels like they're laughing at you, try running the other way.
