LPT: If someone advises you to lie, especially in a non-critical situation, think about it before doing so. It's hard to buy credibility back if you're caught.

This is in response to a pattern of recent posts to this sub that suggest it's a decent tip to basically be dishonest to manipulate a situation, when there are better ways to deal with stuff.

Being a habitual liar is bad. If you get caught enough times unnecessarily lying when the truth would have been the better thing to say, you'll lose the confidence of your friends and family.

Don't start down the path. Unless you're okay with being, well, evil... develop integrity and don't lie for convenient and selfish reasons.
