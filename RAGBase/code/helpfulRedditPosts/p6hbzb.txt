LPT: While it is definitely good advice to not talk to the cops without a lawyer, just remember that respect and tact still go a long way. If you “flex your rights” to a cop in a rude and condescending manner, they can still do a lot to ruin your day.

A lot of videos are circulating social media these days that instruct people to “shut the f*ck up,” “never talk to the police,” etc. if they get detained or arrested. That’s very very good advice. You should definitely have an attorney present before answering questions. But I never see the lawyers in these videos emphasize how important respect and good manners still are when dealing with cops. Yes, you can be snarky and rude when you ask them “Am I detained, or free to go?” But if you piss them off, you’re likely to either be written up on minor infractions (just to cost you money/make you take off work for court), have a drug dog brought to tear up your car for fun, or even have your name out onto a blacklist. Believe me, there are departments out there that have long memories, and if it gets around that you were a dick to them and made them look stupid, your name will get talked about. It just always pays to be respectful to everyone, including the cops. Save the wise cracks for casual conversation. This isn’t “boot licking” or anything. It’s just another step in protecting your own ass.

Edit* Didn’t think I’d need to clarify this; but yes, I realize not all cops are good and some groups of people get treated worse than others. There’s still a difference between being assertive of your rights and being an ass. Chill out people. Damn.
