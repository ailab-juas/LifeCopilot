LPT: If someone can't understand a word you are saying (esp if they have hearing problems), using another word for it would help them understand faster than repeating the same word over and over again.

Plus the repeating one word over and over again is annoying. To both of you.

Edit.  
Other helpful tips from the comments:.  
* Keep line of sight to your face/lips clear.  
* Spell the word.  
* Write the word down.  
* Please try not to be condescending or irritated.  
* Few people have mentioned that they would prefer it if the person repeats the exact same word, so take my LPT  with a grain of salt.
