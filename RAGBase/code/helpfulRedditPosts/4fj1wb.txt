title:
LPT: Always say goodnight to your SO, even if you're upset with them.

content:
Taught to me by my parents, I do this in my relationship. Telling your SO goodnight especially after a fight tells them that you value your relationship more than you are upset about whatever thing is making you upset.

Edit: Holy moly, guacamole. I did not expect this LPT to take off so much. I got a bunch of great responses, both positive and critical, and I like both because it means that this LPT made people really buckle down and think about their relationships and how they handle them. 

This LPT made it to the front page of Reddit, which is hella exciting! Anyway, thank you to all who took part in the discussion!
