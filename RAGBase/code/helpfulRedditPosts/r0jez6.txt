YSK as a Pediatrician, passing out antibiotics is easy.

content:
As a Pediatrician, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to give your child antibiotics (ABX) for what is likely a viral illness. I have dozens of patients each week who come in with symptoms and complaints that are likely a viral illness. I explain in detail viral illnesses to family but in the end, it seems most want antibiotics. I even have patients who will then go to urgent care the next day, usually not seeing a Pediatrician, and will then get ABX or steroids as those places pass it out like candy.

I can easily give antibiotics. In fact, if I give ABX, I can justify billing at a higher level to insurance (99214 vs a 99213). I not only make more money, but parents leave happier. Is it the right thing to do? Not at all. When I don't give ABX to a family, not only do I risk parents not being happy and leaving me a poor review, but I then likely will have to dedicate time for phone call follow ups as these families tend to call for ongoing symptoms (need to let the viral illness run its course). I understand it's tough to take a day off from work and take your kid to the doctor just to be told to continue supportive care, but its the right thing to do.

So please parents, when I don't prescribe ABX, I do it truly because I care about your child. I have seen children have horrible Clostridium Difficile infections from ABX. I have seen a young girl with UTIs that are now resistant to almost every oral ABX, and she now requires to be routinely admitted for IV ABX.

**Why YSK:** Passing out ABX like candy is the easy way out. I don't do it cause I truly care about the wellbeing of your child.  Ongoing ABX use can potentially have devasting side effects.
