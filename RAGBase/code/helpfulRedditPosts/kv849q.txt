YSK how to use the Ivy Lee Method to increase your productivity

content:
Why YSK: The Ivy Lee Method is one of the oldest, simplest, and most effective productivity hacks that you can apply in your life.

Here is the way it works: each night before your day of work, write down your six most important tasks to do the next day in order of importance. The next day, you simply begin doing the tasks you wrote down one at a time.

This method is highly effective because you reduce decision fatigue and reserve your energy for your most prioritized tasks. If you donâ€™t complete all of your tasks, simply add those unfinished ones to your list for the next day.

Edit: Your list should never have more than 6 tasks. Anything more will most likely be counter-productive
