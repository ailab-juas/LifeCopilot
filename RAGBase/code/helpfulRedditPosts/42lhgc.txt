LPT: Use "I can't afford that" as a non-awkward way to dismiss pushy retail workers

content:
It sounds kind of dumb, but I have difficulty in places like Vitamin Cottage where the salesmen/women are very nice and professional but very pushy. I found that by just saying "I can't afford that right now" with a little laugh at the end, they tend to stop trying to get you to buy it. 

**Edit:** A lot of you brought up how retail workers often then introduce financing options and offer credit cards, which definitely makes sense. This probably wouldn't work in those situations, but for a tub of protein or some jeans or something - it usually works.
