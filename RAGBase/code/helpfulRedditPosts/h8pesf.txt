LPT: If you’re making a joke with a child and the child becomes visibly upset, immediately stop.

content:
From years of experience of being with family members who thought that making a child cry was “cute,” if you’re playing a prank, making a joke, or having fun with a child, or literally anyone regardless of the age, and they begin to cry or become upset, stop what you’re doing and address it. Continuing to laugh and make fun of a child while they are crying is confusing for them and they will feel completely vulnerable and torn down, and they will remember that you were being unsupportive of their pain.
