LPT: When staying an extended time at someone’s house (3+ days) voluntarily go do something by yourself. Lay in bed, go to the store, anything. Even if you’re best friends or family with your hosts, you’re disrupting their lives. Give them a break!

Edit: thanks for the gold and the great responses. I did notice a trend in some of that responses that I should have thought of before hand. If you have social anxiety or are nervous about staying some where, dont be! Just be respectful of their space, clean up after yourself and always leave early rather then late.
