LPT: How to stop wondering if you locked the door.

content:
This also works for other small, habitual actions, like turning off the tap or closing the garage door. Basically anything that nags you because you can't remember if you've done it or not.

Simply, narrate your action. After locking the door, tell yourself, **ALOUD**, "I just locked the door." Even after forgetting the action you will still remember saying the phrase.
