LPT: Bring trick candles with you camping

content:
Have you ever had trouble lighting a fire (or bbq, or anything) because the wind keeps blowing out your match or lighter? Just bring a couple trick candles with you (the ones that relight themselves after you blow them out). They only take a second to light, and will burn long enough to light your fire. Just pinch it to extinguish.




Edit: Thanks for all the replies! I've noticed from the comments that a lot of people are saying "if you can light the candle, you can light the fire", which is a good point.

 However, an advantage to this is that you could hold the candle close to your body, with your back to the wind, and light it easily with your whole body as a wind breaker. Then you can bring it down to your tinder easily, after waiting however long it takes for the trick candle to start working. 

If you try to light the fire right at your tinder, it's often awkward to get your hand in there and you usually just have your other hand to block the wind, or your body from an arms length away.
