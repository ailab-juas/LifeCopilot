LPT:  When assembling a piece of furniture, tape the wrench key to the bottom or back.

Title pretty much sums it up.  Kinda obvious one, but a lot of people don't think about it in the moment.  Really helps for when you have to disassemble it or tighten a few loose bolts.

EDIT:  As so many commenters have pointed out, yes, it's a good idea to own a set of tools.  Still though, what if you're assembling some little table or stool that's going to a weird place like a college dorm or your workplace?  It's the handiness of having the key there, not the notion that it covers all your bases.
