title:
YSK federal law requires employers to allow mothers who are nursing as many breaks as needed to express breast milk.

content:
Why YSK: many moms returning to work rely on other means to feed their babies, whether they go into daycare or are left in the care of a relative, friend, or babysitter. While I also have formula as a back-up when needed, breast milk is free and of course there's nothing like it. 

However, this law apparently only applies to employees who are eligible for overtime pay.
