YSK: That teaching your dog, "tricks" is more beneficial to your pet and you than you think.

content:
Why YSK: Trick training is likely to result in better health (as many tricks help build muscle tone and stamina), increased flexibility, balance and concentration, as well as a boost in your dog's confidence in him or herself and you.

Aside from improved health, it improves the owner socialisation of your pet and it helps you connect with others, socialise and often provides a friendship outlet or avenue to be involved in activities and events.

Statistics show that people who have dogs are at a lower risk of physical and psychological health problems including lowered risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, loneliness and anxiety.

So, you should teach your pets as much as their brains can learn!
