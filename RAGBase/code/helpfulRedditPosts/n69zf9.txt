LPT: To have longer conversations, say "Tell me about your day" instead of asking "How was your day?"

content:
It helps to have a longer conversation instead of getting a simple "It's been fine" response resulting (almost always) in awkward silences.

Another tip that can help you have longer conversations is to be interested in the other person's answers, and keep asking questions about them. 

Example of a short conversation:

"What is your job?"  
"I'm a student"  
"Nice, I am a builder"  
"Great."

(Awkward silence)

  
Example of long conversation:  
"What do you do for a living?"  
"I'm a student."  
"Oh, what are you studying?"  
"Psychology."  
"And how is it? Difficult?"  
"No, maybe a little stressful because of the exams, but I like it."  
"That's good. When do you graduate?"  
"This year."  
"Great, you're going to make it."  
"Thanks!"  
"So, will you open your own practice or will you work for someone?"
