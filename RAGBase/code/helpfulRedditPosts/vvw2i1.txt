LPT If you ever need a set amount of time to complete a task, ask for 10-25% more time.

Asking for more time than you initially thought you needed sets the expectation for all parties involved. In my experience, everytime I follow this method, I've finished with 1-2 minutes to spare.

The time you'll need varies, so use your best judgement but this applies to so many things in life:

1) Running late and the GPS says you'll be there by 12:17 - call/text ahead and say you'll be there for 12:30. You can never fully anticipate construction delays or collisions. 

2) Spouse/SO and you don't want to share your one washroom in the morning and they ask how long you need to shave/style your hair - say you need 15 if you need 10. Those last minute beard/moustache trims can get precise.

3) Met with a client on Monday and they expect a proposal - say you'll get back with a tailored document for a review together on Friday at (the time that works best for you).

The benefit: You'll always win since you're done within the requested time. You also don't frustrate the other people since you're not going back to them to ask for more time.
