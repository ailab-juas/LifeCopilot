LPT: To avoid an argument, when you can feel your heart beginning to race in the middle of a conversation, stop talking.

content:
This is your body telling you that all hell is going to break loose if you don't exit the conversation right now. Listen to it, even if every other fibre of your being is telling you not to.

EDIT: This doesn't apply to all conversations, just a conversation that's beginning to anger you. Forcing yourself to talk when nervous, panicked and/or sad can be incredibly beneficial in forming trust in others and giving yourself some emotional relief.
