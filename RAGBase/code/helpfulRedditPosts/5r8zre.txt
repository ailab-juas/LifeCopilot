YSK how to properly perform CPR and the Heimlich Maneuver, and how to work an AED

content:
Reading over a reddit thread earlier today it became clear that the majority of redditors have no idea how to perform CPR or the Heimlich Maneuver if a situation should arise. 

Fast response CPR can significantly increase the chance that someone will survive a cardiac episode with most or all of their mental faculties in check. Similarly, every minute without an AED during a cardiac episode increases the likelihood of significant brain injury by 7-10%, so fast retrieval and use of an AED can have life-changing effects on the patient. 

Worse come to worse, a person needing CPR and an AED is already dead, so there is no harm in attempting CPR. An AED will also not shock the heart unless it detects a proper malfunctioning hearth rhythm, so there is no way to harm a victim of a cardiac episode by using the AED if it isn't necessary.
