title:
LPT Apply Tea Tree Oil to Mosquito bites to instantly get rid of the itch

content:
Can also be used for other insect bites/stings, but I personally use it every time I get bitten by a mosquito, itch is instantly gone

Edit: Make sure the Tea Tree Oil you use is diluted with an alcohol or similar (100% burns the skin) mine is a 20% solution
