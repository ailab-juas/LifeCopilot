LPT: What you should actually do if you find a lost dog.

content:
You find a lost dog. You're a good person, so you want to get the little guy/gal back to their rightful owner. Do NOT post a picture of the dog when advertising that you have found a lost dog. Simply post (via facebook, craigslist, fliers) that you have found a lost dog and to call/email you with your information. When someone calls you about the dog, have THEM describe the dog to you. Why? Because not everyone is as honest as you are, and certain breeds are desirable for various reasons (greyhounds, pitbulls...). Plus, if someone is looking for their lost dog, they wouldn't need a picture of their dog, they'd be checking every found-dog ad within a 5 mile radius. Let's do right by our dogs, thanks for reading.
