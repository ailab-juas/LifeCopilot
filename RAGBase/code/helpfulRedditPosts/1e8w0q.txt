title:
Always take pictures of your apartment the day you move in and the day you move out.

content:
This would have saved me a security deposit fight or two.  Take the pictures with the apartment completely clean and free of furniture or clutter.

Bonus: I've heard rumors (though I'm not a lawyer) that if you print the pictures,  mail them to yourself, and keep them sealed, they are admissible as evidence in court.  Better safe than sorry when dealing with scumbag landlords.
