LPT: when you order buttered popcorn at the movies, say you want it "layered." 

content:
I didn't know about this until I worked at a movie theater concession stand in high school. It's not that out of the way for the employee to partially fill the container, butter it, and repeat. This way the best part of the popcorn isn't concentrated on top (i.e., what gets eaten in the first five minutes). From my experience the concession stands assume people don't know this is an option, and don't mind only buttering the top unless specifically asked not to. 


Obviously this excludes places with self-serve butter stations, BUT you can still request a half-filled tub or bag, butter that, and then have them top it off.
