LPT: Never underestimate manners and a good attitude, they can sometimes be more important than how good your grades or skills are.

content:
This may be common sense, but I got my first big job with a nice pay very recently, and today, i was discussing my luck over coffee with a colleague. I felt lucky, because the firm had essentially stated that they weren't accepting employees at that time, and I thought that I obviously stood no chance, having spoken to the manager a few times. To my surprise, the colleague told me that he "only" considered me because of my manners when we spoke, and went on to accept my CV and stuff for acceptance at a later date, rather than outright refusing. I feel great, but people need to remember their people skills, some professionals have the worst attitude.
