LPT: When offering a favor to someone affected by a illness, tragedy, etc. offer specific things rather than just "anything I can do."

content:
Few people are really going to respond to you asking "Is there anything I can do" or "If you need anything just let me know" by actually asking for something.

Say something like: "Can I make dinner for your family next Tuesday?"

"Can I give your kids a ride to school/soccer/wherever tomorrow?"
