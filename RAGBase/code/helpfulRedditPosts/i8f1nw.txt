YSK that hassling someone for not having kids, even if you’re just making conversation, can be extremely triggering for some.

content:
Yesterday we had a plumber come out for a quick fix and we were past the small talk part, but he wanted to keep the convo going.

“No kids here?” - him

“Nope, just us!” - me

“No kids at all?!” - him

“No, we-“ - me

“Wow! How old are you?” - him

“31. We’ve actua-” - me

“Wow, by your age I had 3 kids! I have 5 now.” - him

“Wow, congratulations.” - me



My husband and I have been struggling with infertility for 4, almost 5 years. Our specific infertility is the worst kind you can be diagnosed with and our chance at having children are impossible without expensive medical treatments. This convo seems harmless. But I was extremely triggered by this small interaction and was rendered useless for the remaining day, so I could cry about my lack of children. 

TLDR: Infertility is an extremely grueling diagnosis and YSK that asking people you aren’t personally connected with about children can be triggering.


Edited to add: Wow! My faith in humanity is restored, thank you all for the love and support, fellow humans!!! For those asking why I didn’t try shutting him up, trust me I did, lol. It was hard to get a word in, this guy wanted to chat my ear off - not listen. I did shutdown completely when he mentioned 5 kids and just wanted him out of the house ASAP at that point.

For those who also have similar stories to mine, I see you and sending you all the hugs from afar.
