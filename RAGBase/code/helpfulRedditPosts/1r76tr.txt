LPT: Splurge on higher quality spices, you'll notice a huge difference in your cooking and the added expense per-meal is very little.

content:
Cheap spices are cheap for a reason. Pureness regulations are very loose when it comes to spices, and there is a long list of acceptable "foreign matter" that can constitute up to %20 of the volume of the product. What this means for you in the end is that your spice will be less flavorful and will introduce other unwanted flavors. Of course the ideal would be to buy whole spices and grind them yourself, but many of us are too busy browsing Reddit to deal with all that.


TLDNR: Step up your spice game, son.
