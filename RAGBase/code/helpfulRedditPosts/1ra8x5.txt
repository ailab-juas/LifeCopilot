title:
LPT: to get rid of spilled or dried wax from any surface, use a piece of brown paper bag and a steam iron.

content:
My wife and I got drunk and she waxed my shoulders. Got wax all over the room. I remembered this wax removal trick from my grandmother. Totally worked.
Just make sure iron is on and set iron over piece of paper bag.

EDIT: NON-SKIN surfaces.  Taxidermy?  Not skin.  However, never attempted wax removal from taxidermy work.

EDIT: set for hot. No steam.

EDIT: heat melts plastic.  I didn't think that point was necessary to make.  As with anything in life, please use common sense.  I just supplied some simple tools.... I cannot supply you common sense.  However, yes, I will note in this text that heat does indeed melt plastic and plastic items like nylon.

EDIT: /u/ramacher brought up a secondary LPT to this thread: Be sure to clean the iron afterward. 

EDIT 5: I have really had a great deal of fun with this thread! It's been really great answering your questions and comments.
I feel I've done a "I soaked up wax with an iron and paper bag - AMA!"
Seriously, thanks for entertaining me and if this helped anyone: thank my Grandma! She was an awesome lady!

Ok, edit 6. I've been drinking for a few hours. Watching a band with my wife. 1) thank you again. And 2) didn't realize I made the front page. I am truly humbled by almost 1,200 up votes. Amazing. All this did was help me remember how great my grandmother was. She had 1/3 of her brain removed for a tumor in 1985. She died in 1997.
Tough lady.
