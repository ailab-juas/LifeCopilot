YSK That when you are young alcohol affects the pancreas more than your liver

content:
While long term alcoholism does affect the liver more, when you are young it attacks the pancreas, which can be fatal. At the age of 25, I was hospitalized 3 times within a year and half, the first time I was not expected to make it through the night

Acute pancreatitis is most commonly caused by gallstones or heavy alcohol consumption. Other causes may include use of certain medications (such as immunosuppressants, estrogens, thiazide diuretics, and azathioprine), lipid (triglyceride) disorders, infections, surgery, or trauma to the abdomen from an accident or injury. Acute pancreatitis is considered idiopathic (cause is unknown) in 10 to 15% of patients.

I wanted to share this to spare anyone the severe and horrible pain that comes with it. NEVER drink on an empty stomach, and do NOT mix vodka and red bull.

**edit**

I didn't want this to be a heated debate, just wish I had known about it.  I had no idea what pancreatitis was or why I was simultaneously throwing up and shitting my guts out before being rushed to the hospital. I was begging to be killed. Just be careful with drinking. I had only started drinking that year. I mention red bull and vodka because I got it two more times oddly right when I drank  them again[]( http://www.fromquarkstoquasars.com/mixing-caffeine-alcohol-good-times-terrible-life-choice/
