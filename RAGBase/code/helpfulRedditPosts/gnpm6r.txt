[Does asking about suicide induce suicidal thoughts?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998511/)


As someone in the mental health field, I think it’s important to share the many myths about suicide. 


1) **Asking someone if they are thinking about suicide plants the idea in their head.** False [see: Dazzi, T., Grobble, R., Wessely, S., &amp;amp; Fear, N. (2014). Does asking about suicide and related behaviors induce suicidal ideation? What is the evidence? *psychological medicine*] Instead it might help save their lives by reducing the stigma and allowing them to open up a conversation about their thoughts (also, don’t be afraid to use the word “suicide” or “killing yourself”) 


2) **People who are suicidal *want to die*.** In most cases, suicidal people don’t *want* to die, they want the PAIN to stop. There is a difference. They don’t see any way to make it stop unless they are dead. Depression is treatable and there are ways to help reduce the pain and find reasons for living. 


3) **People who are suicidal are weak.** False. Depression is a serious, but treatable illness that has nothing to do with moral strength or weakness. 


4) **People who commit suicide are selfish.** False. Most people who suicide truly believe that their loved ones would be better off without them. Many believe that they put a burden on family and friends and that they would be much happier without them. I’ve had patients share these thoughts with their loved ones and they were utterly surprised to see their loved ones vehemently disagree with their thoughts. 


5) **People who are suicidal are just trying to get attention.** I’ll end on this one, because I really want you to remember this. OF COURSE THEY WANT ATTENTION. And?? They *are* crying for help, they *do* want attention because they are screaming for help. If someone’s house is on fire, don’t they cry for help and try to get someone’s attention? Why do we shame people for suicidal behaviors or sharing their thoughts? There are so many more I’d love to share, but I’ll just start here for now. Check on your loved ones.
