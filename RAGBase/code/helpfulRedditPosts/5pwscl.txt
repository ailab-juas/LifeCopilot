LPT: Make it a rule to not make excuses when you are late or cancel plans.

content:
People who are habitually late or cancel plans always have excuses that are usually dishonest, and the recipient knows it. Having these excuses makes the late person feel better about themselves. 

If you forbid yourself from making excuses, you will make an extra effort to show up or be on time because it is really awkward to just take the blame when you disrespect someone else's time.

Obviously, major events don't count. But if you really just felt like watching the rest of a show and that's why you are late, don't blame traffic. Just apologize. It will increase the value in your mind of being on time.
