LPT: If you have a large amount of work to do in a small amount of time, break it down into groups of 20-40 minutes so you don't get overwhelmed.

content:
Instead of focusing on everything you need to get done at once, take it one step at a time. When you're done with that task, take a couple minute breather and go on to the next one. This has helped me so much at work.

Edit: If blowing straight through all your work non-stop works for you, then by all means go for it. However, I have seen people crack under that kind of environment and it was not pretty...and by short amount of time, I'm talking a day or two. Not a fact, just a tip.

Edit 2: I thought it would have gone without saying that this is a very situational LPT, not for day-to-day work.
