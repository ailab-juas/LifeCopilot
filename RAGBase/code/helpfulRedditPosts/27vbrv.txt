LPT: Go to your state's treasury website and search for unclaimed property, your state could owe you money!

I good friend of mine just checked and the state of Massachusetts owed her 6,000. 

Could be something, could be nothing. It's free to check.


Edit: Really happy to see some of you getting what's owed to you!

Thank you for your kind words.

Big thank you for gold!

Final edit: Much thanks to those who gave me some of their hard earned mula.
