LPT: Car stuck in the snow? Throw a floor mat upside down under your tire to give it traction

content:
Edit: A note of clarification - Rubber floor mats and going lightly on the gas are key. Also, as others have pointed out, this is more if you don't have kitty litter, salt, or chains to get out.

Edit 2: Used kitty litter is most effective as per u/fee1sg00dman
