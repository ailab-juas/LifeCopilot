LPT - When sharing your opinion on subjective topics, music, movies, food, etc. There is no need to be hostile. The music doesn't suck, you just don't like it. The pizza topping isn't horrible, you just don't like it. People's opinions of you won't decline if you're just sharing your likes/dislikes
