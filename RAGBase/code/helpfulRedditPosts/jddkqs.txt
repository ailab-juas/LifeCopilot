LPT: Under EU law, if you purchase something that fails within 6 months, the seller has 1 chance to repair/replace. If the repair or replacement doesn't fix it, you can return the item regardless of any return policy.

After 6 months, the onus shifts to the customer to prove the item was faulty when bought, but the same process applies.
