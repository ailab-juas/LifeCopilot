LPT I grew up in a deaf household as a hearing kid, here is something I learned. If you don't like being in a packed theater, buy a ticket to a closed caption version. Most hearing people don't go into captioned movies.

Just editing this in later

I went to watch endgame and there was like 10 people in the room on release day, all because it was a captioned version.

And if you're wondering, the movie still has sound.

Also I worded it a bit wrong and I meant that a movie theater could have a CC option, they're not completely separate.


I just woke up and holy shit my phone exploded. Most awards I've ever had, I can be one of the cool kids now.
