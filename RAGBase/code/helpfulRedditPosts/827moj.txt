YSK:Dollar tree pregnancy tests (VeriQuick) are just as effective as the more expense brands.

There is no reason to pay for a more expensive product if it has been proven the cheaper generic version of the product is just as effective.

Upon checking out at the Dollar Store, next to the cashier, I saw $1 pregnancy tests. 

Dollar Stores offer a variety of cheap generic brand products but seeing the pregnancy tests was the most valuable one I saw.
