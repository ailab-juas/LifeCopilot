Next time I'm returning it at the slightest problem... In warranty.

**Edit:** Thanks for the input everyone. After reading all the comments I think a better phrasing would be:

*LPT: When you make a major purchase, set a reminder on a cloud-based app for two weeks before the warranty expiration. Examine your purchase for flaws and don't get screwed by premature failure.*
