Sugar alcohols are commonly used as sweeteners in sugar free candies and gum.
Most of these have highly pronounced laxative properties in moderate amounts.
Erythritol is the only sugar alcohol that does not have these affects on people however. 

EDIT: They're also extremely deadly for dogs. (Thanks shmegeggie for the info!)
