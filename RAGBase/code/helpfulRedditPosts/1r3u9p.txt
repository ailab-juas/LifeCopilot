LPT: If you are alone for Thanksgiving or another Holiday, consider volunteering somewhere that day.

content:
You might meet people in a similar situation as you and can have the satisfaction of doing something good.  

Edit:  Replace alone with alone and want to be with other people. There is nothing wrong with being alone by choice.  

Edit2: Volunteering is not limited to soup kitchens and other similar places. There are many other opportunities.
