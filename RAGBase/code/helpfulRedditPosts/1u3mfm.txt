LPT: If a bee or wasp lands on you, blow on them to get them off instead of slapping and they won't retaliate.

content:
Fact: If you swat a bee, they're honor-bound to try and kill you. If you blow on them really hard so they fall off of you, they just think you're a particularly windy person and will go perch somewhere else, no hard feelings.  
  
Bonus ProTip: Also works with wasps and probably whatever other flighty bugs you might have crawling all over you.  
  
Edit: People are citing that CO2 bothers some insects. You can blow a pretty strong blast from your cheeks without actually inhaling, if that's a concern. No inhalation, no gas exchange (But, between us, I say you just blow that bumblebee like a champ and walk on).
