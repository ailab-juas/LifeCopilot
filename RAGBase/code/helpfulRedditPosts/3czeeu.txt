YSK: If you see someone you think is committing a crime, look at their shoes. It's a clothing item they can't easily change or take off.

Earlier today I saw two kids who had just broken into someone's car near my house. On my bike I accidentally followed them for a block and realized what was going on and circled back to find them. By then they had ditched the bags in an alley. I waited for the cops since there was some woman's stuff strewn all over in an alley, including her work ID.  

When the officer showed up they asked about a description. The kids had taken off their shirts so as to make it harder to find them if they put them on later. She said, "this is the thing that always gets them, did you see their shoes?" I totally missed them, but two kids in dark jeans holding white shirts in their hands isn't too much to go on - but it's not like they were going to bring an extra pair of shoes.

Anyway, it's a TIL, but YSK to keep an eye out for shoes as well. 

Edit: Yes, look out for their shoes *in addition to* the rest of their clothes, not *just* shoes. Thanks to u/ilikemazdas for clarifying.
