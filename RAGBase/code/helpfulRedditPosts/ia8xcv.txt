YSK: If you're working at a restaurant and someone dine and dashes on you then legally a manager or superior can NOT make you pay for what was consumed by the customer.

I worked at a restaurant for years while growing up. Let me tell you it was awesome and amazing money for a young fellow like myself at the time.

There were few times when someone got up and left without paying for their meal or drinks whether it was an accident or just on purpose. Few managers always made me pay for that loss which ranged from $20-60 sometimes. This is aimed at teens and maybe college students who don't know better. This is ILLEGAL a manager can not force you to pay something that a customer consumed without paying.

So if it happens to you just inform them you aren't required to do that.. Most servers in the industry make $2.13 an hour and rely on tips to make a living. It's fucked up to expect someone to pay something that they had no control over. Job description is to serve the customer not supervise them and chase them demanding a payment.

Thanks guys!
