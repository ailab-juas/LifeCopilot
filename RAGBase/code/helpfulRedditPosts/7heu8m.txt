LPT: Start each year off with an empty jar, and fill it with notes of good things that happen. On new year's eve, empty it and see what awesome stuff happened that year.

This year has been full of ups and downs.  Recently I had a really big down (I lost my job) but this year was a great up (I got married this year).  It was easy for me to become depressed and forget about all the good things, but thanks to my spouse and memories of us getting married I should feel blessed and excited about 2018!
