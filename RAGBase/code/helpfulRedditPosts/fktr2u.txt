YSK truck drivers are struggling to eat during restaurant shut downs.

content:
YSK if you see a truck driver walk to the door of a restaurant and walk away, they have no way to eat. Since walk up at drive thru isn’t allowed and most trucks don’t fit, they have no way to order or receive their food. You should ask them if you could go through the drive thru for them and pick up their meal. We owe them that much.

Edit: Thank you for the awards and comments. I think it’s important to clarify that I am not a truck driver. I just spoke to one at the gas station this morning because he couldn’t find anywhere else to eat and I thought I’d share.
