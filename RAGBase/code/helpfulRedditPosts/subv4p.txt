LPT: In the age of hustle culture, constant progression, success porn, and "let's do more"...it's important to remember that it's okay to be content.

This is a life or death kind of tip. People quite literally often run themselves into an early grave, or eventual mental dispair in the pursuit of "more". 

This applies to your job, career growth, home, social life, you name it. 

Don't let anyone trick you into uprooting your comfort and enjoyment of life solely for the pursuit of the "more". It's okay to be like "Nah I'm good, I like it here." It doesn't make you lazy, it makes you smart. 

Life is a long game my friend. Get to a place in life where you enjoy what you enjoy, and do not be in a rush to change it just because it's constantly pumped in our culture.
