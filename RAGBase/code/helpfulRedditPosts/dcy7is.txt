LPT : Use a seam ripper to easily clean out hair tangled in a vacuum brush

content:
You can use a seam ripper, common in sewing for breaking thread and removing stitches, to cut through hair, fur, string, or other thin items that are tangled on the brush bristles of a vacuum.  I always found scissors were difficult to get under the tangled bundle but a seam ripper has a sharp thin point perfect to get underneath it then you can just pull up to cut through the hair easily and remove from the brush.
