LPT: Only consume caffeine occasionally to avoid the building of tolerance and utilize its full effect when you need it.

content:
Many people consume caffeine on a daily basis in various forms be it energy drinks, pills, black tea or coffee to help them get through the day. What they don't know is that the brain can develop an actual dependency on caffeine within one or two weeks. It is very mild compared to alcohol or opioid dependency and it has no serious long term consequences but nonetheless it has an effect on how caffeine works for them.

Instead of actually boosting your awakeness and focus above normal levels you need caffeine just to get to the same level of someone who doesn't consume caffeine at all and sleeps well. People feel like its hard to function without it. But fear not because you can lower your tolerances as fast as you build them. Just don't consume any caffeine for a week and you should be fine allowing you to get the full effect when you need it. It is also important to note that you should drink enough water when you try to change your habits. Caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches but so can dehydration. Also I am not telling you what to do with your life, just merely stating facts.
