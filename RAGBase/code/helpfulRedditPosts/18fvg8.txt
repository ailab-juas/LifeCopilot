LPT: Trouble getting small screws started into small holes? use a small paperclip to hold the screw (see images)

content:
place the screw in the paperclip like this: http://i.imgur.com/nd8Rmvw.jpg

Then you can either hold the paperclip to place the screw over the threaded hole, or lay it flat like this: http://i.imgur.com/yQPyAy1.jpg (sorry holding camera with one hand and screw driver with the other)

EDIT: Forgot to mention that once the screw is started you can just pull the paperclip out.
