title:
YSK that you should use Google Scholar rather than Google when searching for scientific or medical studies and articles

content:
Google Scholar will search the actual studies and articles from journals in the field.

Normal Google searches will bring up blogs, articles from TMZ, etc. that might vaguely refer to a study, and its ostensible conclusions, which they typically misreport.

Even articles from places you might normally consider substantial, like the NY Times, are largely written by lay journalist with no background in science, statistics or biostatistics--or at best a very minimal one. They merely rehash and reinterpret what the conclusion in the abstract of the study says.

Just reading the abstract alone is never enough.

It's always best to read the original study. Sadly, most journalists (even at places like the NYT, WSJ, and Wash Post never include links to the original studies for people who might not otherwise know how to find them).

On another note, for those who want to delve into the actual studies--everyone should learn basic study design and statistics/biostatistics.  Just because a study is published doesn't mean it's a good one; many, if not most have flaws. It's often a matter of degree.

At least that's for medicine/med device/biotech/pharma. I can't comment on the articles that are in *Nature* or *Science* outside of my scope of knowledge (and their respective journals).

TL;DR: **Use Google Scholar for any searches regarding medical or scientific studies, not regular Google search**
