When you get a pay rise or new, higher paying job - do not increase your standard of living inline.

I started out on a very low basic salary and studied alongside working to get promoted several times and earn more money. With the increased mortgage and paying off several finance payments for items I don’t actually need in a bizzare way I’ve got less money than I had when I was in the middle of my pay range.

My LPT is to resist the urge to spend that additional money and instead maintain your current standard and save the excess money. This way you could save up for a house deposit / pay off current mortgage sooner / retire younger.
