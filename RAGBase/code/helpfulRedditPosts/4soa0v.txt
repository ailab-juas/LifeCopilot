LPT: Trying to catch your dog that got out/off its leash? Try laying down.

content:
I've never known a dog to shy away from licking someone's face.

After watching someone chase their dog around for 20 minutes(the dog thinking it was a game) I walked over and layed down. The dog immediately came over to lick my face and I grabbed its collar.
