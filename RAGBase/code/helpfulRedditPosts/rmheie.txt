YSK that if you interact with a nice worker in the service industry, calling the company they work for to praise the worker will usually provide a tangible benefit to that person's life. Just don't mention discounts or cut corners.

Why YSK:


 1. it makes your life better to have them put in the extra effort to be nice to you, so it's nice to make their life better. Usually they don't see a ton of reward.


 2. it costs you nothing to call, and only 5 minutes of time usually. 


 3. It's a powerful statement, because people usually just call to complain. A compliment speaks loudly. 


 4. It's good for the businesses too, to have workers that are pleasant. Everyone benefits from them rewarding solid and friendly employees. 


Tip: don't mention them giving you discounts etc. Do mention the solid experience they provided you as a customer, and how friendly they were.
