YSK that you don't have to squirt eye drops into an open eye. You can drop them into your tear duct, tilt your head and blink rapidly instead.

I haven't found anyone who is comfortable using eye drops. You can tilt your head back so you face the ceiling, drop a drop onto your tear duct with your eye closed, then tilt your head sideways (so your tear duct is above your eye) and blink rapidly. No pain, no irritation and it has the same benefits.

Edit: Drop them from a centimetre or two above your tear duct. Do not touch your eye when you do it.
