YSK that keeping a balance on your credit card to "build credit" is a fallacy.

content:
Why YSK: Many people think that by paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month and keeping additional money owed helps to build credit. This is not true. All you are doing is paying unnecessary interest. Pay your credit card in full each month. 

I understand that this is not possible for all people due to many different factors. For the people that can do this, should.

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all of the people that gave awards to show that this helped them. That is all I was trying to do. For those that are spamming me with hate speech, know that it does not bother me.
