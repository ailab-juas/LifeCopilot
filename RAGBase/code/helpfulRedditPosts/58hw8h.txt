LPT: A real, effective apology has three parts: (1) Acknowledge how your action affected the person; (2) say you're sorry; (3) describe what you're going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn't happen again. Don't excuse or explain.

content:
Most people treat an apology as a way to explain their point of view. But that feels to the listener like making excuses or minimizing their experience. 

Say your roommate accidentally ruins your  couch by spilling a big cup of coffee on it. Think about which you'd rather hear. 

Mediocre apology: 
"I'm so sorry! I just got startled when my phone buzzed and I accidentally knocked it over. It was totally an accident. I feel terrible."

Good apology:
"I know you really like the look of that couch, and now it's got a stain on it - you must be really bummed about that. I'm so sorry. I'd be happy to pay for a cleaning, and in the future, I'll keep my drinks in the kitchen. 

Edit: Reading through the comments, I think I should clarify. I'm talking about situations where you feel bad about something you did or said, and want to clear the air with an apology. This is not applicable to situations where you feel you did nothing wrong, or don't want to apologize. 

Edit 2.  Well. Had I known anyone would actually read this, I probably would have put some time into thinking of some better examples! I'm super new to reddit, so this has been interesting. 

I went though the first couple hundred responses and got some rough numbers, as follows:

1. This is a pretty good idea, I will contribute some further thoughts or information: 12%

2. I like this. Nothing further. 11%

3. This is the right idea, but Jesus H. Christ, your examples are terrible. 8%

4. I will tell a joke. 7%

5. You gotta have some explanation, or else how are they supposed to know what you're apologizing for? 7%

6. I wish [person in my life] did this. 7%

7. You plagiarized this from Jimmy John's/Dr. Laura/Daniel Tiger/other. 7%

8. You gotta also do something else (ask forgiveness, actually do something to make amends, etc.). 7%

9. And for the love of FSM, never say "I'm sorry you feel that way" or "I'm sorry, but..." because that's awful. 6%

10.Apologizing sucks. 6%

11. This would not be appropriate for every situation. 5%

12. This is a terrible idea. 4% 

13. Something about Trump. 3%

14. I have my Google JD and/or my cousin's wife's stepmom is a lawyer, and therefore I have determined that you'll be legally liable. 3%

15. Here's a link you won't click. 3% 

16. This is just as stupid and repetitive as the rest of the thoughtless dreck on this wasteland of a sub. I'M LEAVING. 3%

17. You are a robot/HR person/narcissist/ neckbeard fuckboy/passive-aggressive jerk. 2%

Percentages rounded.
