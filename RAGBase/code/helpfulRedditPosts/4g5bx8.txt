LPT: Hot weather is coming for part of the world, put your left shoe in the back with your baby or toddler to help prevent hot car deaths.

content:
On average 38 kids die per year in the US due to hot car deaths.  It can happen to anyone - it even happened to  a NASA scientist.  As soon as you step out of the car, you'll immediately recognize that your shoe is missing.  Don't let over-confidence kill another child (e.g. "I'm a great parent and I'd never forget my child").  With rear-facing carseats and a sleeping or quiet child.. it can happen.

EDIT: glad I found the world's largest crowd of perfect parents who make no mistakes.  It's just a tip, ignore and move on if you don't need it.
