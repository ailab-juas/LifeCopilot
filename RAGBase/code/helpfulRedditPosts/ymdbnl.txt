YSK that if you are hearing a buzzing, hissing, or whistling sound (something similar) out of nowhere, it might be Tinnitus.

content:
Why YSK: This might be a chronic condition that can last for years, which can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It is best to learn about what you can and should do to manage it.

It can cause sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and depression. It can make it difficult to hear. In severe cases, tinnitus can be disabling. There is no cure for chronic tinnitus, but there are management strategies that can help lessen the symptoms and make it more manageable.

Of course the best option still [to have peace of mind] is to see an audiologist to have your ears checked.
