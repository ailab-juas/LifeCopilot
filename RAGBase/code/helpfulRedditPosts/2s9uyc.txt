LPT: When creating a temporary file, name it or prefix it "ToDelete"

content:
So when you browse your files, you'll remember to remove the useless stuff. Also, when you want to clean your desktop, it gets easier, you don't have to think *what was that again?*

I use this for : 

- test projects
- drafts
- drawings you want to share on social media

**Edit** 

Wow I didn't expect this post to get that much attention!

For those who suggested to put the files in a specific folder, there's something to consider:

When you save a file, the program you're using remembers the folder, and will suggest this folder for the next time you want to save a file (on Mac OS)

As I often save the same kind of files in the same place, this works well for me. And if I start to save files in different folders, it means I have to change the folder all the time. So the file naming system saves me time.

However the folder system as other mentioned is good, especially if you have a folder that empties itself when you reboot your computer.
