&gt;Yes, but its a little bit trickier. Launch Netflix and then wait a second or so. Then using the left stick on your Xbox controller click up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, up, up, up, up. This may take a few tries to get it right. If you mess up just wait a second then try again. If performed correctly, it should open a menu showing some of the things mentioned above as well as a "Log out" option. 
 /u/familydoubledare pointed out that you can use the D-pad for making this procedure easier.

&gt;The Netflix movie player (Silverlight desktop version) has the following keyboard shortcuts:

&gt;Space – Toggle Play/Pause

&gt;Enter – Toggle Play/Pause

&gt;PgUp – Play

&gt;PgDn – Pause

&gt;F – Full-screen

&gt;Esc – Exit full-screen

&gt;Shift+Left arrow – Rewind

&gt;Shift+Right arrow – Fast Forward

&gt;Up arrow - Volume Up

&gt;Down arrow - Volume Down

&gt;M – Mute toggle

&gt;**In full-screen mode:**

&gt;Ctrl+space – Frame forward/backward mode. 

&gt;Ctrl+space pauses the movie and enters key frame mode (aka intra-frame or i-frame mode). The right and left arrow keys then move between key frames.

&gt;The following 

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+* shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Option+* in Mac OS X)  toggle information displays on/off when the player is NOT in full-screen mode. The displays will remain on, however, if full-screen mode is activated.

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+M – Menu;  includes loading custom .dfxp sub-title files.

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C – Codes; frame rate plus other (unknown to me) info. 
Also makes the other overlays green.

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D – Display A/V Stats on-screen

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L – Logging window

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+P – Player info

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R – toggle color Rotation for overlays in Chrome; 
probably a debugging feature.

&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S – current Streaming bit-rate and manual bit-rate selection
