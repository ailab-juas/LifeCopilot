LPT: If an individual or couple says they don't want children don't tell them how great kids are, that they will probably change their mind, etc. While it's very possible their being completely transparent, many people with fertility issues also say this because it's a much easier response.

Edit: *they're not their in the title (can't figure out how to edit that)

If someone isn't able to have children and doesn't want to discuss it, there really aren't many socially acceptable answers when you're asked by co-workers, casual acquaintances, or even family. If you say you would love to have children but can't then you've shared very personal information and likely made the other person very uncomfortable. 

Bottom line: Just accept it if people say they don't plan on having kids unless they ask for your input. Otherwise you're risking potentially rubbing salt in a very open wound without even knowing it.
