LPT: For my money, getting up earlier than usual and going outside for a decent lengthened walk for 10 to 20 minutes, while it's still chilly and dark and it's just you and nature, is the best form of caffeine there is.

I've been doing this for a few weeks now and man the difference is insane.

My body feels nice and lose and limber at work. I have a ton of energy, no drowsiness. I feel an immediate sense of accomplishment at the very beginning of the day which motivates to care of my body throughout the day.

I just absolutely couldn't recommend an early morning walk more.

And hell I'm not picky. Make your coffee first and take it with you.

This isn't an anti coffee post, I still drink it and am drinking one right now lol
