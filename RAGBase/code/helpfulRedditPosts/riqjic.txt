YSK: If you have a cat, and keep on waking up in the middle of the night, it might not be insomnia.

   Why YSK: it might just be your cat being a loveable jerk.

For the past year and a half, I kept waking up in the middle of the night, wide awake startled. I thought my insomnia had flipped- nope. (I usually have the hard to fall asleep type) Turns out my cat just smacks my face in the middle of the night or bites my nose or toes when he is lonely or cold to wake me up. Caught him a couple of times, and now that I have gotten a bigger blanket that covers my head and feet, it doesn't happen anymore.
