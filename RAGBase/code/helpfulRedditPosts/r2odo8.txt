title:
LPT: Before you put up your Christmas tree, fill your tree stand with 2‚Äù of ice.

content:
Trees need to be slightly elevated in the tree stand so they can absorb the water. Holding a tree up in the air while someone else tightens the screws is really hard. If you put a few inches of ice cubes down, that will hold the weight of the tree while you fine-tune the angles and clamp it in place. Ice cubes melt and tree stays held up perfectly.
