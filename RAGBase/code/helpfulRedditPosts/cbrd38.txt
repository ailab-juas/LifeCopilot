LPT-- NEVER Send a Message When Angry. Wait 24 hrs or Have Someone Edit it For You before you hit Send!

content:
A coworker is getting fired all because he got angry at the boss and sent an angry email.  This coworker is in a rough spot in life financially and his getting fired now couldn't have happened at a worse time.  However, this is 100% his fault, the email was one of those What-the-fuck-were-you-thinking emails that you instantly regret sending.  He flamed the boss and trashed the entire organization all over a nothingburger and a miscommunication.

The problem is, unlike spoken word, written word is forever.  You can't unring that bell when you say certain things and this goes triply so for when you WRITE certain things.   "Sorry" doesn't fix everything.  

So, he is getting fired.  No reprieve, no 2nd chance.  

Sometimes life isn't fair, sometimes being right doesn't matter.  In fact, being "right" is overrated and learning understanding when to be right is a life skill.  Before you start a Conflict over being right, ask yourself, "Is this the hill you want to die on"...  (I started a LPT on this a week ago but it was taken down...  Well, wish my friend had read that reddit posting)
