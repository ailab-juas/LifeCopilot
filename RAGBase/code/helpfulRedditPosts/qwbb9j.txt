LPT : avoiding paywalls / subscriptions when trying to read articles on a computer

content:
Iâ€™ve never seen this one on here, so here goes:

If you are trying to access an article via computer that has a pay wall, just hit refresh, and while the page is loading, hit the print button before the subscription notice pops up. 

This works sooooo often for me. And you can even drop down the destination and select save to PDF if you want to view it easier. 

Happy reading
