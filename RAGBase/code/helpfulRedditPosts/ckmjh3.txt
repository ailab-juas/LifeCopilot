title:
YSK that you can schedule text message to send later so you don't interrupt people's sleep or meeting.

content:
Create your message. 
On Android, click on the 3 dots at top right
"Schedule"
Set time.
"Set"

Now and then, I still forget to schedule and wake people up at 5 a.m. because they're in 2 time zone over.  Sorry, sibling!!!

EDIT: Sorry, I thought it's an Android feature. It seems that it's not.  Been using LG for many years now.   I found this feature a while back.  Maybe on the LG Stylo which ran about $200-$250 from Metro PCS.

Sorry, Apple folk.  I didn't know it's available on Apple.  Someone commented that there's an app for it.
