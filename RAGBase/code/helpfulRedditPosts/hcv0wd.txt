title:
LPT: If you are filming someone leaving a crime in a vehicle, verbally say the license plate number.

content:
I just saw a video just posted of a hit and run, and by all reports no arrests have been made. If you are filming someone leaving a crime because you are trying to help, say the license plate of the vehicle you are following out loud (and multiple times) so it can be heard on playback.
