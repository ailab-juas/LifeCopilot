LPT: Teach you're children gun safety, regardless of whether you own firearms

content:
**EDIT Child gun safety is typically a video and a pamphlet, it is not gun handling, ie these rules:**

**DON'T TOUCH**

**LEAVE THE AREA**

**TELL AN ADULT**


If you don't own a firearm and your child encounters one, it may very well be under uncontrolled circumstances.

I had a friend who drilled gun safety into their kids, though they hated guns.

One day their kids were playing at a neighbor's house, 6 or so kids, no adult present (sleeping in another room), and one of the neighbor kids brought out the father's gun to "play with."

My friend's kids did the right thing and left, notifying an adult. They said later they felt physically uncomfortable being in the room with the children handling the gun due to their conditioning.

Right as my friend arrived at the neighbor's house there was a shot. The gun had been unintentionally discharged while they played with it. None of the 3 kid's who had stayed was injured, but with 3 more crowding around the odds wouldn't have been better. As it was the only casualty was a refrigerator.

You can only control your environment, so teach your kids to do the safe thing.

**EDIT: Totally aware of the grammar errors, new voice-to-text program was acting up.**

**EDIT 2: Not terribly disabled, profound vision problems, but I was trying to cook apple crisp and post simultaneously, and I am missing a large area of my vision, plus an apple corer/peeler/slicer is a great tool, but these were very juicy fujis, and I didn't want a sticky keyboard**

**EDIT 3  WOOHOO GOLD, thank you!**

**EDIT 4 front page? for a misspelled post?**
