YSK - Your keyboard should be inclined the OPPOSITE direction or not at all ‚å®

content:
**Why YSK:**

**Most keyboards are angled or come with kickstands that angle the keyboard** ***downwards towards you.***

[This is terrible for your wrists, ergonomically speaking.](https://ergonomictrends.com/proper-ergonomic-typing-posture-at-computer/)

You want the opposite, a keyboard that angles away from you to keep your wrists in a neutral/negative position. Prop your current keyboard up to fix this.
