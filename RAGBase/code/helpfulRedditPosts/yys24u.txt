title:
LPT: wash your backpack if you’re noticing more body funk than usual.

content:
I just laundered my backpack that I’ve worn for years and realised the straps trapped all my sweat and BO. 

Sometimes I’d wear clothes once, even with deodorant and antiperspirant, and they’d stink at the end of the day. 

After washing the straps, I’ve noticed I’m smelling way fresher than usual.
