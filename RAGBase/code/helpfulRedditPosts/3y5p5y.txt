YSK how to easily remove cable/zip ties from your pranked Christmas presents... don't use scissors use wire cutters instead! (For safety's sake, do not use a knife you could severely injure yourself! )

content:
To easily remove cable ties from any item, including that present from your brother use wire cutters, dykes or linesman pliers.  They will cut through the plastic like butter! 

Cutting packages with tools that aren't intended for that purpose is time consuming and will likely damage your scissors or knife and more importantly is the cause of most cuts to yourself... avoid the ER.this Christmas!
