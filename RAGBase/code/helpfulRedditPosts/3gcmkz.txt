LPT: Make your house smell better with vanilla

content:
Put some artificial vanilla extract in an oven-safe dish and turn the oven on low heat. Your house will smell like fresh baking, and it covers up smells - including those caused by, ahem, "baking", better than any commercial air fresheners I have tried.

Keep the dish in the oven until it evaporates. The vanilla can be cleaned out of the dish easily by letting it soak.

EDIT: One, Wow. Two, it works better than popcorn. *Trust me.*
