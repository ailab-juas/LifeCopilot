LPT: Wash your pets' food dishes and food containers often

content:
This may seem be common sense, but it's easy enough to forget. And after visiting separate family with pets over the past year...

You wouldn't eat off the same plate for a month using the same fork, knife, chopsticks, etc. after they've been sitting out at room temperature 24/7. Especially if you didn't rinse it off.

You wouldn't use the same food container for months constantly cycling new food in without washing it in between fill-ups

Your pets are not impervious to bacteria, viruses, parasites, etc. Pet food is also not impervious.

Edit: In regards to all the "yea, well, my dog eats poop..." comments: Nobody is advocating for animals to eat feces (their own or otherwise)! An animal can occasionally do something and not get sick, yes. But that does not mean that they are incapable of getting sick in other ways. Occasionally cleaning food dishes and containers is a simple step to help prevent sickness. Preventing your animals from literally eating poop is another simple step.

Also, thank you for the awards!
