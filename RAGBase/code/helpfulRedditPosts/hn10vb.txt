YSK Librarians don't care how much money you owe

content:
Yes, we would want you to return your items in a timely manner in good conditions, but it does not matter to us if you have fines.  A lot of people come in to the library thinking they will be judged for their fines, but they won't. The library isn't here to make money, we just want you to have all of the books to read and be happy to come see us!
