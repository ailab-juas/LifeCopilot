LPT: If travelling internationally, always make sure you know how to contact your countries embassy in the destination country.

content:
You never know why, how or when you will need to make contact with your countries embassy. Natural disaster, lost passport, sickness or other. They are there to help you in an emergency.  

It’s best to know how to contact them, where they are located and hours of operation BEFORE you arrive.  

If you lose absolutely everything you have, the embassy can and will help you.  

Always also make sure you have access to be able to get a hold of your personal details, passport, certificates etc while travelling overseas. To issue an emergency passport, special details are required.  

Have a secure email that you can access while overseas, with scans of important papers. Birth certificate, passport scan, emergency contacts. Once your international travel has finalised, delete the email address.  

Being stranded in a foreign country, with no phone, money, passport or spare clothes will make you so stressed. Being able to help your embassy help you will alleviate a lot of this.  

Please...not every country you visit is the same as the one you have come from!   

As noted by /u/swild89, always register your international travel with the government. (There are websites for this). If there are emergencies, they will know how to find you, or you them!  

Also, check you passport expiry dates please. A lot of countries require you to have a minimum of 6 months of validity remaining on your passport AFTER your departure date from that country.  

Don’t get stuck at the departure gate to go on your dream trip or work travel only to be turned around because your passport isn’t valid enough.  

Please...it doesn’t take long to check!
