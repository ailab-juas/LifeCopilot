LPT: Record yourself telling those closest to you that you love them

Record yourself telling each of your loved ones "I love you [name]"

My forever 18 year Old daughter was murdered in 2018. I have a lot of videos of her but none of them were of her saying "I love you mom" there was one of her telling her dog and others family she loved them. I was so sad thinking I'd never hear her say I love you ever again to me. Today I was searching in an old email account and found a video my husband had recorded of each of my kids telling me they love me, he did it while I was at work as a surprise for me. They were little kids and sounded soooo cute!

Now I have a video of my deceased daughter telling me she loves me and an added bonus of my living two telling me as well.
