LPT: To split rents equally with a friend. If one of the rooms is better than the other first divide the rent by 50/50 then auction how much more you/ your friend are willing to pay

content:
For example, the combined rent is 200, first split into 100 and 100. You bid 5 more USD (105 - 95) he bid 20 USD (80 - 120) until the other guy won't bid more.
