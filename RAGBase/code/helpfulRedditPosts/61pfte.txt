LPT: If you're ever called by your bank's fraud department hang up and call them back.

content:
I got a call from someone claiming to be from fraud department of my bank over the weekend. The call showed up on my caller ID as US Bank which is how I have it saved in my contacts. He said there was a fraudulent charge from American Airlines and I was on that their website booking a flight about an hour prior to the call. 
For a moment I thought it was legit but then he asked for a pin #. 
Just be careful because the caller ID makes it seem real. The actual fraud department said they have seen this multiple times with the caller ID showing as the bank. :/ 
edit... Hey thanks to everyone that shared a story or gave advice! I appreciate everyone's input :)
