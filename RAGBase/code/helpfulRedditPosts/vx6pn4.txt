LPT: When visiting foreign lands: make a card listing your allergies in the local language

content:
My girl and I went on a holiday recently. My girlfriend has a life-threatening allergy and an inconvenient one. We had a friend write a short warning about both, including the possible consequences, in the local language of our holiday destination.

I made two cards, one credit card sized, one postcard sized and laminated them. The credit card sized one as backup, but we never used it in the end.

This made a huge difference when ordering food. Just show the card to the serving staff. Usually they will take it to the kitchen. After a while they return with a list of safe options for you to order, or the cook will come and discuss how to adapt food for your allergy.

We had a 10 day foreign holiday without a single food allergy related incident. Not a life-changing thing to do, but just one less thing to worry about: clear communications about dietary requirements.
