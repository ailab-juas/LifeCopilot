LPT: If you like the idea of a product but not the product itself, type in Google "[product] vs" and check the search suggestions for alternatives

content:
For example, as you type "Facebook vs" you'll get autocomplete suggestions like "Facebook vs Google+" or Facebook vs Twitter." This allows you to find new alternatives to try out. Some things I've found using this method: Todoist ("Wunderlist vs"), KAT ("The Pirate Bay vs"), and Reddit ("4chan vs"). It works for other things too, not just software ("Leatherman vs"), ("ballpoint vs"), etc. 

Just watch out because sometimes lawsuits will appear (i.e. if you're searching for an alternative to the color brown you're going to find that the Board of Education is not a color).

Of course there are other ways too, but this is always quick, and simple. 

Edit:I'm talking about the automatic suggestions that appear as you type, not the results themselves.
