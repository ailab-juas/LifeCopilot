LPT: Don't take chances with bed bugs! When staying in a hotel, designate sleepwear and keep them separate from your other belongings. When leaving, throw your pajamas in a plastic bag and be sure to wash and dry them on high heat.

#####**Tl;Dr:** Don't set your luggage on beds or upholstered couches. Don't use hotel dressers or shelves unless you have to, and opt for hangers if you can't live directly out of your luggage. Designate sleeping clothes and be super cautious even if you don't notice signs of infestation. Bag your sleepwear in plastic and isolate it from your other clothes when you pack. Wash everything in warm water and dry on high for at least an hour when you get home. 

Bed bugs are [making a huge comeback](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8502491/bed-bugs-kill-increase) due in part to pesticide resistance, and hotels are a prime place for transmission of these parasites. 

Your first line of defense is always to inspect the room thoroughly. Check the mattress under the sheets and mattress cover for spots or [discoloration](https://bedbuglawyer.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bed-bug-infestation-on-a-mattress-e1629294258192.jpg). Depending on their [lifecycle stage](https://cdn.domyown.com/images/content/bed_bug_life_cycle_stages.png), bed bugs and their eggs can range [from the size of a tiny speck to a sesame seed](https://bedbuglawyer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-1.32.57-PM.jpg). 

You want to check pillows, the bed frame, and any cushions or upholstery in the room as well. 

The good news is that, unlike ticks or lice, bed bugs don't like heat and don't typically live on their hosts (aka **us**). Instead, they find harborages in nearby cracks, cloth, and crevices, and wait until we're asleep to feed. They travel by hitching rides amongst your clothing and luggage. That means that if you can keep your belongings away from where they live and feed, and don't cross contaminate your bed wear with everything else, you can mitigate (not eliminate) your risk of bringing these pests home with you.

Don't take chances with these things, a bed bug infestation is notoriously hard to eliminate. These simple precautions might save you thousands in exterminator fees and possibly a case of PTSD.
