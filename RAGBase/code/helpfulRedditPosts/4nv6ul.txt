They require waiting a year after a sexual partner before donation. And local blood banks in my area are working on changing their questions to no longer exclude these completely viable donors. American red cross already has changed this.

Donate as often as you can, not just in the wake of disasters. Disasters are always happening, you may not hear about them and something that takes 5 minutes to do could potentially give someone another 10 years of life.

*Edit for clarity.

E2- some resources to educate some on the blood donation and screening process.
