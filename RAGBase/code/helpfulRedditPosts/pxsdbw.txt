LPT: If given the opportunity, you should take a typing class in high school or college! Your future self will thank you!

content:
One of my most useful classes that I took in high school as an elective was a typing class which well teaches you how to touch type, allowing you to look at the computer screen or look at someone speaking or whatever and continue to type with little to no mistakes! 

People get so tripped out when Iâ€™m typing and then I look at them and they are like Woah! How can you do that ðŸ˜‚ 

Iâ€™m just saying your future self will thank you if you learn it when you were young like I did!

Edit: itâ€™s 6am and I canâ€™t spell on my phone
