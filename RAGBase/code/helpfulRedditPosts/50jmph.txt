LPT: If you're new to working out, the type of exercises you do matters less than being persistent and consistent with them. Don't try to optimize your routine prematurely and give up because you can't find the best one.

This is sort of in reply to a comment I read recently that irked me the wrong way.

I feel like some people will always try to point out things like "these exercises won't get you ripped" - as a reason NOT to do them, and I think this also demotivates others, completely unecessarily.

But if you've never done consistent working out before (or your record is spotty) - almost any reputable exercise is worth doing, and sticking to, and being persistent. 

In fact, there is no magical exercise that can get you ripped in a short period. Consistency, persistence and pushing to advance exercise difficulty when you can are the keys.
