LPT: Use LaTeX math formatting in Word, even outside Equation Editor!

content:
In Word's *Equation Editor* you can use LaTeX formatting to make things quite a bit easier. So type out your equations as:
&gt;A_circle = \pi r^2
Much better than clicking through ribbons and icons!

Another useful tip, is that you can use some LaTeX formatting outside of *Equation Editor* as well. This is particularly useful if you type out Greek letters (\alpha, \beta, \pi...)

To activate this functionality:

* Go to Options
* Select the Proofing tab
* Click on the 'Autocorrect Options...' icon
* Select the 'Math AutoCorrect' tab
* Check the box 'Use Math AutoCorrect rules outside of math regions'

And voila! You can now type Greek letters and other symbols (\degree, \degc, \int, etc) directly into your document.

edit: wow front page! this has blown up since I posted it this morning. Anyway, fixed formatting. And...I didn't really want this to be a Latex vs Word thing. Yeah...Latex is superior (I wrote my PhD dissertation, a book, and loads of papers with it) but it can be a pain at times (using a managed pc? collaborating with a bunch of people?). So this is really just aimed at making life a bit easier with Word.
