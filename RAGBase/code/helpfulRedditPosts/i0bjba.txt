YSK that you can change your car’s cabin filter and engine air filter by yourself, in less than 10 minutes and for less than $45

content:
Even if you don’t own a Phillips screwdriver for the engine air filter, an autozone will let you borrow one when you purchase the filters. Don’t let a dealership or oil change spot rip you off for something that can be learned and done easily.
