title:
YSK: the phrase “curiosity killed the cat” is only half the sentence, the full sentence is much more uplifting. It ends with “but the truth brought it back to life”.

Why YSK:
The term is often used to stop people from finding out something they want/need to know, or doing something they’ve always wanted to do

The full term however is uplifting and powerful.
