YSK that your health insurance company often has a free 24/7 health line to help direct you to care.

For the last 2 days, I was suffering from really severe abdominal pain. Unfortunately, it got to the point of unbearable at 4 AM, so my only options were to either tough it out with some Tylenol until urgent care opened in the morning, or go to the ER. Given how expensive the ER was, I really, really didn’t want to go if I didn’t have to. I looked up health crisis line online, and found that some insurance companies offered free ones for customers. Sure enough, mine did. I gave them a call, was transferred to an NP, and relayed my symptoms. As soon as I mentioned the constant pain was in my right lower quadrant and was really severe, she told me it was best I seek treatment within the hour, meaning the ER. Went there, had a CT done, and then had surgery to remove my appendix since it was massively inflamed.

TL:DR Check with your health line if you need a professional recommendation to seek treatment late at night.

Edit: This is for the United States specifically

Edit 2: Thanks so much to everyone for replying and generating discussion. Honestly the first recovery day has been pretty rough, and talking to strangers on reddit has somehow made the pain more bearable. I wish you all well and hope you get the healthcare you need!
