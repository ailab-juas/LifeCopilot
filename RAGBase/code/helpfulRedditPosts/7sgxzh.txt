YSK: Your Vizio smart TV is spying on you unless you manually turn it off

content:
About a year ago, [Vizio was fined $2.2 million dollar for collecting and selling customer viewing habits without their consent](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/business/vizio-television-vizio-collected-viewers-habits-consent.html). Their TVs do this by periodically capturing screenshots to figure out what viewers were watching and sold that information to third-parties, which was called "Automated Content Recognition" (ACR). 

Practically all of their newer models are shipped with this enabled by default and they even remotely turned on ACR on older models, but it can be disabled through a somewhat hidden menu setting. 

[Vizio's guide on disabling ACR] (https://support.vizio.com/s/article/Smart-Interactivity-Broadcast-Interactivity-FAQ-How-to-turn-Smart-Interactivity-Broadcast-Interactivity-on-or-off?language=en_US).

[How to disable it on Samsung, LG, Sony brand TVs](https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/how-to-turn-off-smart-tv-snooping-features/).

**Edit:** Not only that, they also collect other private info of your devices, ["Vizioâ€™s ACR software 'also periodically collects other information about the television, including IP address, wired and wireless MAC addresses, WiFi signal strength, nearby WiFi access points, and other items.'](https://consumerist.com/2017/02/06/vizio-to-pay-2-2-million-for-watching-tv-watchers-without-telling-them/) - Thanks /u/carlsan
