YSK: If you encounter an emergency situation in public where no one is taking charge, start pointing directly at individual people and stating what they should do

content:
Example: 

Point at someone - "Call an ambulance"

Point at someone else - "Find me some bandages"

Point at someone else - "Try and find a doctor close by"

Just yelling randomly for someone to call an ambulance leaves everyone thinking someone else is doing it.
The [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) takes place when there are large groups of people and everyone believes someone else is already helping. The larger the group, the more powerful the effect.
