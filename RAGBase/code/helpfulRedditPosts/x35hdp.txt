LPT: Stop being fazed by what people have to say or think about you, your life, and what you choose to do.

content:
*Nobody* on this planet has **all** the answers. To be fair, *most* people regardless of their age, have **no** answers, which explains why they live mundane lifestyles.

Every human you know to exist is learning life just the same as you are. So who are they to make a judgment of the choices you make? The things you say? Or the things you do?

You have every right to be exactly whoever you choose to be. Nobody can take that from you. You control your world. Don't be bothered by any outside comments. Because at the end of the day, that's all they are, **just comments**.

The *only* judgment you should even ***consider,*** should come from those you aspire to emulate. Other than that, tell anyone else to fuck off (not literally, be nice).

This is your life. Live it however you desire. Just be kind to others in the process.

The world is yours my friend.
