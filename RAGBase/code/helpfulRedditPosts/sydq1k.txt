YSK that in the USA, the National Labor Relations Act makes it illegal for companies to ban you from discussing pay and working conditions.

Why YSK: in my few years of working for greedy company after greedy company, some of them try backhandedly (or even obviously) to prevent employees talking amongst each other about their compensation. 

You absolutely should talk about how much you're getting paid and make sure everyone *of the same skill level* is getting paid a similar amount. 

This is the first of many steps we can take to help assure women, minorities and handicapped people, (and everyone else for that matter) are paid appropriately for their work.

Edit: Thanks to u/aburke626 I have some more clarification on the legalities regarding all this. Thank you! 

Here’s the FAQ page for the NLRB, some good stuff here in general: https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/faq/nlrb

And specifics on discussing wages: https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages

Who is covered by the NLRA: https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/jurisdictional-standards

Edit 2: So I have been made aware by many, many comments that there are many employers in many states that can just fire you for no reason. 

Take this with a grain of salt and be safe out there. Don't get fired.
