title:
YSK that online IQ tests are not the most accurate of things

content:
A while back I decided that I wanted to do an IQ test, and so I found one on the internet and did all the fun puzzle questions.

I can't exactly remember the result, but it was something in the 150 range. Now, I'm not a total idiot, but I'm also not exactly a genius, and at the time I closed the site and wrote it off as inaccurate.

Thinking back on it, I remember it telling me to pay something like Â£60 pounds for a certificate in order to 'prove' I had a 150-something IQ, and that was probably why the result was so high. No one's going to pay money to be told they have an IQ of 60. 

So in conclusion, I think the reason so many internet idiots have ridiculously high IQs is due to both their enormous egos and not being bright enough to realise they've been scammed.

TL,DR: take IQ tests on the internet with a grain of salt.
