YSK: Paper towels are not recyclable

content:
Why YSK: Though paper towels often start as wood, cardboard or paper by-products - these materials are beaten into a pulp and their natural fibers are broken down in the process. This, combined with the chemical treatments the final products go through as well as the glues, softeners, bleach and other additives in most paper towels makes even clean products unsuitable for recycling. Most paper towels encounter food waste and other heavily contaminated materials during use that make them further unsuited for recycling. 

Alternatives: If you're hoping to be more green, try looking for paper towels brands made from 100% recycled material, using washable cloth options, or even finding a brand that can be composed. 

For years I’ve been throwing my paper towels in the recycling because I assumed “paper” in the name automatically made them recyclable, so I hope this is helpful!
