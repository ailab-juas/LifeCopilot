YSK if you adopt a very young child or baby, tell them they were adopted right from the start, don't wait until they're older.

content:
"The few studies that exist indicate that the late discovery of adoption is linked to psychological distress and feelings of anger, betrayal, depression, and anxiety."

In this [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192513X19829503?journalCode=jfia) it states that "Results indicated that those who learned of their adoptions from age 3 and older reported more distress and lower life satisfaction when controlling for the amount of time adoptees have known of their adoption statuses and their use of coping strategies."


Basically, if you tell them right from the start, including, of course, that you love them, it is much better for the child's mental health.
