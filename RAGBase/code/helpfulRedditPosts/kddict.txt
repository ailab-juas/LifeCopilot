LPT: Keep your resume updated at all times and apply to a job at least once a year.

content:
You never know what you could land into and you’ll get an update on how much your experience could be worth. You don’t have to necessarily take a new job but it’s good practice to interview, check out new places and you might get some very life changing offers.

Edit: This blew up overnight lol. There’s a lot constructive comments in here. I read a good amount of the comments and just wanted to clarify that this LPT is #1 about keeping your resume up to date and cover letter as some of you mentioned. Why? Because you never know what happens in life. Fair example: COVID-19. Doesn’t hurt to be a little bit prepared. #2 Applying to other similar jobs while you’re employed. There is nothing wrong with that. Your current company doesn’t need to know what you do with your life. Companies are disposable just like employees are. The reason one might apply to another job could be anything such as higher pay, higher position and more involved etc. This LPT doesn’t suggest for you to pack up and leave the company you enjoy because of a better pay. But applying to other places will give you an idea of how much your skills are worth. #3 Applying, interviewing and accepting a higher position and salary doesn’t necessarily mean that “X” company will be heaven. That’s why there’s an interview process for them to interview you and you them. Absolutely you cannot tell how life in “X” company is from only 1-2 hrs of interview. But you can pick up on some green and red flags and will have to make a tough decision based on that and what your life goals are. Hope this helps and clarifies some confusion. Best of luck.
