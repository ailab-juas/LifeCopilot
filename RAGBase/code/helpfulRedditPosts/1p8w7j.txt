YSK: The phrase "I'm sorry" can be used to express guilt OR sympathy. It's annoying and ignorant to tell someone who's trying to communicate the latter "Don't apologize, it's not your fault!"

I see a lot of [reddit threads] (http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p705m/how_dare_a_stranger_tell_me_to_take_off_my_hijab/) where people are sympathizing with someone who's experienced something painful, and other people come along and tell them to "stop apologizing" for something they didn't do.




Even worse is how often this happens in real life. Funerals seem to be the only place people understand that "I'm sorry for your loss" doesn't mean "I'm sorry I killed your mother."




Please take the time to understand which sentiment is being conveyed when someone says "I'm sorry" and don't tell people to "stop apologizing for something you didn't do" *unless that's actually what they're doing*. It's patronizing, frustrating, and just shows your own ignorance.








**Edit**: Wow, great discussion! But to clarify, **most of the time this misunderstanding happens NOT when you're consoling someone over a death, but over one of the more mundane difficulties of life** (e.g. The other person gets laid off, or has a really bad fight with their SO, or is on the receiving end of a racist comment). 




I know the word "ignorant" can be used as a slur equivalent to "idiot," but in this case I'm using it to mean its true definition, "lacking in knowledge." And my "annoying and ignorant" comment is less directed at the individual who doesn't understand what I'm communicating than at people's tendency to do this in general. It's especially not aimed at people dealing with bereavement, as that is one of the few times the context is usually understood (and a bereaved person can pretty much say or do anything without offending me, since I've been there and know you're often barely processing what's going on around you).
