[LPT] Stuck sleeping in your car in a small, remote town? Want a nice, clean restroom? Try the local courthouse.

content:
I frequently sleep in my car when I’m road-tripping through the rural United States, and some of the gas station bathrooms are just absolutely nasty. I’ve lately taken to using local small county courthouse/administration building bathrooms. They’re usually open early, they seldom have anyone else in them, and they’re usually very clean.
