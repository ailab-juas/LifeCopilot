LPT : Learn to say no

Learn to say no and do not apologize for it. 

Many of us hesitate to say no to others. That was me ten years ago. I now say “no” all the time, and do it guilt free. 

Backstory, I am generally handy all-around. With these skills (and since I also have a truck) I am frequently a target for large favours. 

I am a busy person. I have a job that I work more than full time at. I have a young family and a wife that both deserve my attention. I exercise regularly to stay fit. I have a house to maintain. Free time is not something I have a ton of. 

When people ask me to help them on my day off, I am very selective to what I say yes to. 

More often than not I say no. 

Now here is the key part. Don’t say sorry for saying no. 

Don’t postpone things and say maybe next week or for some undetermined later date that will just linger. Don’t justify why you’re saying no, just leave it at no. 

It is empowering. When you struggle with saying no in personal or professional situations, it helps to remember the self-preservation in passing things up.

Saying no is one of the best forms of self-care we can engage in.

Edit : if someone needs help in an emergency situation or a really bad situation, be human and help. If it is just general help and they are either to cheap to pay someone or looking to save themselves some of their own time etc say no.
