YSK: Deer and rabbits "park" their babies and spend most of the day away from them. If you find a baby all alone, it is almost definitely not abandoned. DON'T bring it somewhere to 'save' it unless it's in immediate danger - you're probably just kidnapping it from its mom.

This has happened way too many times at our local wildlife rescue. People find baby deer or rabbits with no parents nearby and think they're abandoned, so they bring them in to try to "save them". In reality they're just forcibly separating the animal from its mother and greatly reducing its survival chances.

Infant rabbits without their mothers don't do well. Even in professional care settings, they have about a 90% mortality rate. Taking them away from the nest should be a last resort, only when death is guarenteed otherwise.

Edit: Also, PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO TAKE CARE OF A WILD ANIMAL BY YOURSELF! Baby wildlife relies on species-specific milk from its mom, it will usually starve if you don't know what you're doing. We have to keep 4-5 differently mixed formulas to make sure every species is getting fed what it needs. If you keep it for more than a few days, it will become accustomed to humans and that will DESTROY its survival chances. Also, with many animals, it's often illegal! Please call your local wildlife center (or any, really) if you're considering saving a baby animal and double check with them.
