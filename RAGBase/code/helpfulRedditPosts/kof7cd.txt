LPT: If your parent has a box of sentimental stuff, go through it with them ASAP and ask them lots of questions. It’s a lot less fun to sort through when they’ve passed.

My (26F) dad passed away 2 weeks ago. He had two huge trunks of memorabilia. He wasn’t one to talk about himself much and would never have volunteered to dig through it together so we never did, aside from looking through a few photo albums last summer. Now I’m sorting through this stuff and finding letters to his grandpa from Buckingham Palace, photos of him hitchhiking across Canada in the 70s with people I don’t recognize, and stacks of sketchbooks from his art college days. It’s nice to still be learning things about him, but I wish I could have him next to me so I could ask him about a thousand questions. You may think you know your parents’ stories but I guarantee there’s so much they’ve forgotten to tell you. Do it while you’ve still got em around, people. You won’t regret it.
