title:
YSK the most common reason condoms fail is because people use them wrong

content:
Lots of people use them wrong, including, but not limited to:

1) Not checking the expiration date and not using a different condom if the condom seems inferior or damaged after opening

2) Not using it the whole time of penetration

4) Keeping it in a too hot or freezing place such as a car on a freezing day

5) Keeping it on a place where there will be a lot of friction, such as a leather wallet

6) Not using the right size condom

7) Not leaving space at the end (but also make sure there is no air at end, just the extra room, unfilled).

8) Using an oil-based lubricant with a latex or rubber condom (use water or silicon-based instead)

9) Not using lubrication when necessary

Why YSK: no one wants to end up with a surprise pregnancy or STD this Valentine's Day!

Edit: Note that perfect use still has the rare accident, so have a back-up plan, whether it's being on the pill, having a plan to get the Morning After pill if the condom breaks, etc.

Edit 2: Also another good one is make sure to hold the base when you pull out

Edit 3: Also be careful about opening a package with a sharp object

Edit 4: Do not put a condom on one way and then flip it inside out

Edit 5: Yes, for you special commenters, if you are having sex for over half an hour the friction can be enough that you should change condoms

One final note: I added the NSFW to the post because I'd rather people read this than complain about it being inappropriate. I did not blur the image; that automatically was uploaded from the linked website and was automatically blurred by Reddit. Also I don't know why the  3 keeps disappearing and the numbers shifting down. Some sort of coding error I guess.
