YSK that if you own dogs and drop an Advil/Motrin/Midol, you better find it. Ibuprofen is highly toxic to dogs.

This happened to us a few years ago. Wife dropped a few Advil and thought she got them all. Later in the day I was playing Wii Tennis and the dog came up to me and pissed all over the floor. Zero bladder control. Full torrent. At my feet. 

Apparently it does something to the kidneys and your dog has no idea that it needs to pee. So it just does. 

We rushed him to the vet where we figured out what may have caused it and had to leave him overnight for monitoring. We lucked out. Eight years later he's still fine. 

Only posting this because I was telling my coworker the story and she'd never heard about ibuprofen and dogs. I figure that maybe some of you don't either and hopdfully can keep all of our pups from getting hurt or worse.
