YSK about secondary drowning

content:
Now that summer is in full swing and parents are constantly in charge of their kids, this is an important thing to keep in mind, especially when swimming with young children, who can start struggling in water super quickly. 

Secondary drowning is when water gets into the lungs, and as the bacteria or chemicals (like chlorine) in the water irritate and cause the lungs to swell, it reduces the lungs' ability to absorb oxygen.

Because this happens over a period of time, it's possible for a child to have a near drowning incident at the pool, seem fine right afterwards, and then drown in their sleep. While not very common, it's very dangerous and can be avoided by going to the hospital when you notice symptoms.

These are the symptoms to look out for:

- Reduced level of consciousness (extreme tiredness or reduction in mental function)
- Pain in chest
- Difficulty breathing
- Irritability or mood swings
- Persistent cough
- Fever

If you or someone else experiences these symptoms within 72 hours of inhaling water you should go to a hospital.
