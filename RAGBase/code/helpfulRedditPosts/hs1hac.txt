title:
YSK your cat may be sick if they are always sitting by the water bowl

content:
I had to have my cat put down yesterday. He would lay by the water bowl all day, and when we took him to the vet they found out that he had kidney failure, liver disease, and abscesses in his intestines.
Pay attention to your animalsâ€™ behaviors, because it may mean life or death.
