LPT: You can go to almost all museums in NYC for one dollar.

content:
I know a lot of people don't know much about this but you can get into almost all museums for only one dollar. The prices that are displayed in the museum and on their website are all suggestion donations in which they want you to pay but aren't required to get in. The process is just as easy as well. Simply go on the same line that everyone else goes on to get in and when they ask you for your payment, give them a whopping one dollar and bam you're in. I'm posting this because I recently heard a number of classmates that wanted to go but simply didn't have the money for the suggestion prices. Please spread this to all friends and family that might ever want to go to these museums in the future.

**Edit:** Damn did not expect this to blow up as big as it did, so thank you everyone who commented and voted on this post. First of all I want to state that I am a high school student that doesn't have a job so obviously this is something that is very convenient to many students and I. If you have the money to pay the suggested donation then I would recommend you at least pay a little more but that is totally up to you. 
Okay, clarification on everything else, firstly this only applies to public museums such as the MOMA and the American Museum of Natural History. Private museums however make you pay whatever their admission is. I see some things in the comments saying that some private museums allow free access on certain days of the week but I am not a hundred percent sure that is accurate so I would recommend doing more research on that if that is something you are interested in. Secondly, this applies to various public museums within many other states and countries and is not only a thing that occurs in NYC as many people have stated below which I found to be very convenient to people that do not often come to NYC. Thanks again everyone for all the feedback and have fun at any museum you do plan on visiting in the future.

**Edit 2:** A word and a space.
