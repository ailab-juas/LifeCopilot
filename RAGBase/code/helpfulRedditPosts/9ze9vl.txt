LPT: Take time to learn how to properly fall. It sounds ridiculous but as a snowboarder/skateboarder if you know how to fall it will save you from injury very easily. Not just in extreme sports but in every day life.

Edit: Wow I didn’t realize this had such an “impact” on so many people. (Please excuse my shit pun) 

But for those of you wondering how to learn please take the advice of other redditors and take some martial art classes,  skate/snowboarding lessons and one major way I learned was air awareness lessons on trampolines.
