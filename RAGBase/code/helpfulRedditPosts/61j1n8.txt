LPT: There are still 10,000 puppy mills in the United States. If you're buying a dog, insist on seeing the breeder's facilities.

EDIT: To sum up what I think were some great comments: 

- There are many great dogs who need homes in shelters. Go follow your local humane society on Facebook. 
- *NEVER* get a dog from a pet store. 
- Apparently this LPT applies for other animals as well (e.g. Parrots)

And just to clarify, puppy mills and responsible breeders are very, very different. See this article for a great write-up: http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-dog-factory-inside-the-sickening-world-of-puppy-mills-w457673
