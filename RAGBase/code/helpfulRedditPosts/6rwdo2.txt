Edit: Wanted to include some extra info from the comments (some of this stuff is buried):

* Insects and animals are a less risky first choice than plants (u/Omikron).
* Some people are imagining filling your belly with oak leaves. In deciding which plants to test in the first place, go with what seems tasty/filling (u/TacoinaToaster suggests root tubers). Bonus points for boiling/roasting.
* **The test doesnâ€™t apply to mushrooms** (u/salasia).
