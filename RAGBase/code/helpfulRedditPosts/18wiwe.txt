YSK how to fall asleep

content:
Someone posted a "tricks to fall asleep" thread, but then it got deleted while I was writing this masterpiece.

So, for everyone that was curious, my wisdom.

You're asking the expert here. I had trouble falling asleep for a long time, but I've accumulated a lot of advice that I personally use that almost always works unless I'm really jazzed about something.

Before bed: 

1. Get off the internet at least 20-30 minutes prior. Also, no music with a fast beat. Our heart rate will rise to mimic the bass beat of music we listen to. Relaxing music like Tangerine Dream's "Underwater Sunlight" or sound effects like Rainymood.com are better options.

2. If you can't get offline, at least turn down the screen brightness. Fl.ux gives me a headache.

3. If you're really hungry, drink a lot of water.

4. Take some melatonin if you really have a hard time. Read [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/17gffp/proper_use_of_melatonin_please_upvote/) for more information on dosage and long-term use. As always, consult a doctor before taking any drug regardless of how harmless it may seem, especially for extended periods.

5. Avoid eating a meal at least 3 hours before bed.

6. If you're super hungry, make a small sandwich with like one piece of bread or have some cheese and half a glass of milk. Nothing acidic or sugary.

7. No caffeine at least 5 hours before bed. Seriously. Also, don't drink a lot of water too close to bedtime if you have an overactive or small bladder. **Edit: Everyone metabolizes caffeine differently, and there is a genetic marker for fast or slow caffeine metabolizer. I'm a "fast." If you have trouble figuring this out, try stopping earlier and earlier until you figure out your personal timing.**

8. Brush and floss yo damn teeth.


Bedtime:

1. If you need to remember something for tomorrow, write a list or make the things impossible to avoid (put your keys in your shoes, put your phone on your wallet, put the garbage can in front of the front door, or do what I do and set up reminders in Thunderbird (or Outlook, whatever.)) If you think of something you forgot to write on the list, immediately get up and write it down on the list. It will bug you and you WILL forget.

2. Be comfortable. Experiment with different thicknesses of pillows. Have a decent mattress. Use clean sheets. Clean sheets feel awesome. Don't be too hot or too cold. I like it a little cold at night, personally. Helps me sleep better.

3. White noise. I use a white noise generator which is just a fan inside a plastic box, but some people use ocean surf, rain, etc. If you have a loud neighborhood and cars or slamming doors wake you up, work on your soundproofing or white noise. Yes, you might have to pay some money to make life comfortable. Don't be a cheapskate; some things are worth it. Getting a good night's sleep is one of the most important things you can do for quality of life.

4. Don't think about shit you need to do tomorrow. Don't worry about bad stuff that might happen. Don't dwell on past mistakes. You won't remember anything in the morning anyway, so it's not like you're gonna figure some shit out when you're exhausted and trying to sleep that you couldn't figure out when you were wide awake.

5. Relax your muscles. All of them. Your jaw, your back, your neck, your butt. Even your feet. Take a mental inventory of your whole body from your scalp to your toes and make sure they're all unclenched. A stressful life can mean you're clenching your muscles all day, and you may become used to it.

6. Breathe deeply and slowly for a few minutes. Get your heart rate down. You can't just jump into bed with your heart going 90 or 100bpm and expect to fall asleep.

7. Think about something enjoyable, but not sex, unless you plan to have a wank (which can also help, but then you can end up with a mess to clean up.) Good options are: what you would do with lottery winnings, what would your perfect house be like, how would you build a zombie-proof mansion, what beach resort would you like to visit. Think about that TV show or movie you watched most recently, or your favorite. Go through it scene by scene in your mind. 

I have this one where I try to figure out how to find people in a world where all the people have disappeared. I run through a list of all the shit I'd do, like preparing signs to post around in cities, how I'd install a loudspeaker system and lasers on a car, etc. For me, picturing a world devoid of people is pretty relaxing.

A lot of times just reviewing the day's events, as long as they were not stressful, is enough for me to fall asleep. 
BUT, it can't be TOO interesting or you get too into it and you trigger your creative problem-solving brain. So if you tend to think about puzzles or new creative projects or problems from work at night, don't. You'll want to get up and write things down every 5 minutes.

Once you find something that works, use it every night. Your mind will become used to falling asleep to that thing, and it will become a trigger.


Sleep well.

**Edit:** Updated for melatonin disclaimer.

**Edit 2:** I should add, have a consistent wake up and bedtime. Don't oversleep, don't mess up your schedule every weekend.

**Edit 3:** As pointed out, use your bed just for sleeping and sexing. Don't put a TV in your bedroom, don't read or browse or play vidyagames in bed.
