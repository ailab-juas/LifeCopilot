YSK - In the US, you can use EBT (food stamps) to buy seeds and fruit trees.

Like many in this US right now, my household currently receives food assistance through the EBT program. Today, my girlfriend was at a big box store picking up some food, some seeds and a fruit tree. When she used the EBT card, expecting it to only cover the food, the card paid for all of it.

We are currently planning a garden and orchard on our property, and this is a great way to use the EBT program to buy a sustanable food source!
