LPT: If you're prone to anxiety during turbulence on an airplane, tighten your seat belt and lift your feet off the floor. You won't feel the shaking as much and you will calm down.

I learned this one day when I thought for sure I was going to nosedive into middle America during a pocket of rough air. 

I tightened my seat belt but it wasn't enough. The floor was vibrating and something just told me to lift my feet up in case the floor ripped out. (this is how terrified I was... I actually believed the floor of the place could just drop out) 

Immediately I felt like I send of crazy bumps and jarring, all I felt was the occasional bump and it was more of a graceful sway rather than feeling like I was in a dogfight. As soon as I put my feet back down, I felt every little shake through my body again and the impending doom set in  once more. 

So there you have it.  If someone smarter than me can explain why this is, I'm all ears but here's your tldr 

TL;DR:

  If you hate turbulence, tighten your seat belt and lift your feet off the floor of the plane.
