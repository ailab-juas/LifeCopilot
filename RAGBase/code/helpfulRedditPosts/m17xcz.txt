LPT: Learn to talk about the weather. It is not about the weather as much as it is about making human connection. For older and lonely people it can be the only conversation they'll have in a long time. So don't shy away from talking about the weather, it will only bring smiles and opportunity.

We know that talking to strangers is good for us: it has been shown to improve our mood, make our commute seem shorter, et cetera. It doesn’t have to lead anywhere else. It’s enough to have a conversation about the humidity if the alternative is no conversation at all. Also, in a more professional context it is a safe and personally unobtrusive topic. It is the very thing everyone has in common, weather talk is a kind of code that we have evolved to help us overcome social inhibitions and actually talk to one another. Small talk about the weather is an entrée to our shared humanity and is therefore the most important conversational topic to master.
