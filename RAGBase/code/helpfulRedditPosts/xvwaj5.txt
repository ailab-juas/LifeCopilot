title:
YSK that when it comes to lifestyle changes, a depressed person is going to take smaller steps than a healthy person

content:
Why YSK: Because I personally have seen and heard about how some of these conversations go. Especially between a child and their parents. Whenever someone says “well that’s not too big of a change”, that really can hurt someone who already is in pain. When someone is depressed, making huge changes is going to make them fail at best, and send them into a steep downward spiral at worst. It’s OK to take large changes slowly. As long as someone is doing the best they can, they’re doing well. If someone is proud of something, you should congratulate them and tell them they’re doing a good job. Don’t compare them to other people’s achievements or your own
