LPT: If working from home, remember to make up for all the socializing that you're missing.

content:
Yeah, working from home is great. You don't have to wake up too early to get ready and commute and you are also saving money on fuel or tickets. 
However many people don't realize that It's easy (especially if you live alone) to start getting some social anxiety from the lack of other people around you. Meaning that you will eventually start feeling somewhat uncomfortable around other people when you have to go out and meet others. 
So start trying to go out for chores /  to work out or to meet some friends. It's important that you don't lose your ability to connect with others. 
Take care of your mental health people! 


EDIT: Wow. As an introvert myself, I certainly did not think this could get so polarizing for so many.. 
To the tone deaf people, please read the part about people living alone.
The only reason i suggest you try to participate in some kind of community, is because me and my partner did experience different forms of anxiety we did not have before after working from home and having to meet people. 
I only wanted to make sure that people who might get similar anxieties in the future can prepare and plan accordingly. 
By all means though, you do you.
