LPT: If you have a bee problem (a hive in your house/yard). Don’t call an exterminator, call a local beekeeper.

content:
Bees are expensive. Most beekeepers would love some free bees. And will take care of them for you. That way not only do you get rid of the bees for free. But you don’t kill them and they get a new home. Save the bees guys
Edit: thanks for all awards and upvotes.
