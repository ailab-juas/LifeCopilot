LPT: No Christmas plans this year? Ask that elderly neighbour if they'd like to join you. Many elderly people spend Christmas alone and it's a really difficult time of year

To everyone saying this is offensive and poorly timed pity, I am glad that you don't need this offer.  [In my country of 70million, 1.7 million are lonely at Christmas.  ](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-press/articles/2018/december/christmas-loneliness-statistics/)

The comments taking offense at this have blown my mind.  Compare having to decline offensive offers (with good intentions) with how it must feel to have no offers at all.  It's an easy choice.

Should the olive branch have been extended earlier in the year? Absolutely.  The best time to start was ages ago.  The second best time is now
