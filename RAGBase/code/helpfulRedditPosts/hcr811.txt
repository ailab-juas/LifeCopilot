YSK: Only expect HR to promote your interests when it comes to payroll &amp; benefits. If you’re having problems with discrimination, retaliation &amp; harassment, HR will promote your boss’ or company’s interests, not yours.

content:
In the wake of a host of stories about racial discrimination in the workplace, it’s been sad to see so many of these people expect talking to HR to help them. HR systems in companies are not designed to look out for your best interests. They are designed to protect your boss and the company from YOU. If you are having problems, document EVERYTHING for when you need to get a lawyer or government agency involved.
