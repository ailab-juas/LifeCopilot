YSK that the FREE app Libby gives you access to thousands of ebooks and audiobooks

content:
(I suppose the Technology flair would also be appropriate.) You simply use your library card to login and it gives you access to all of your library system’s digital media! Once you have borrowed the ebook or audiobook, you don’t need an internet connection to enjoy it as it is stored on your phone - actually a lifesaver for long trips. I cannot even tell you how many books I have read over the past two years thanks to Libby!

Edit to add that not all libraries use the same apps/provide the same free resources, but it is very much worth it to explore the options available to you!!

Edit #2: it was brought to my attention that I should point out that Libby works like any other library system and only has a limited number of copies of any ebook/audiobook (however many your library system has purchased). As such, you may have to place a hold and it may be a few days, weeks, or even months before you get a chance to enjoy the requested book - but if you don’t mind waiting, it’s worth it! You also have the option to sort by “available now”, which will only show titles that are able to be borrowed immediately.
