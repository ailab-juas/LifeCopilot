LPT: Cover all open cameras you have on laptops and phones, especially company property. Never assume they are off and always assume someone is watching.

content:
I work from home for a large bank and one of the higher ups just slipped up and hinted that he was watching me through my work laptop camera that was turned off. He commented on something I did when there was no way he could have known as my camera was off. His comment was too specific and perfectly timed to be coincidence. It was confirmed by the extremely awkward silence every other higher up had when he made this mistake. He tried to laugh it off as a joke, but it wasnâ€™t funny and just made it even more creepy. Assume if they have the access they are using it.
