LPT: Wear ear plugs to a concert. Not only will it save your hearing, but it makes everything sound much better.

I'm not sure if this will get downvoted because some of you may think it's common sense, but I just got back from a huge rock concert and I was the only one who seemed to be wearing ear plugs.

I'm also a musician, so I can vouch that wearing a tiny set of disposable ear plugs will make your concert experience much more enjoyable. The ear plugs block most of the highs and make the sound condensed into a much more balanced sound. Everything becomes much more clear, and you won't leave the concert with that annoying ringing.

Again, I don't know if this is common sense to most people or not, but I thought maybe some people didn't think of this. Enjoy :)
