title:
LPT: If you suffer from depression, you likely suffer from 'Anhedonia' this makes you not feel pleasure/not feel like doing anything. You have to just do your hobbies, etc. anyway even if you aren't motivated. It's the only way out of that hole, it fools your brain and eventually works.

content:
It may be boring/you may not feel any joy or enthusiasm from doing hobbies at first, but remember the alternative is just accepting that the anhedonia/depression is true but it isn't true it's lying to you. Your brain is lying to you.
