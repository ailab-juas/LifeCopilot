YSK: You can "sharpen" razor cartridges by rubbing them on a pair of jeans and get MONTHS out of one cartridge, if not more.

I tried this trick a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised at how my blade pretty much sprang back to new.  But, since I work from home, I only shave once a week and I totally forgot about it.

Then I watched this video:

**EDIT:** you only need to watch the first 5 minutes of the above video.

*The guy has been using the same blade to shave his head for 2 months now.*

*Just a general howto video*

*USB Microscope video of the blades before and after, showing you that it actually works.*

Supposedly soaking your blades in mineral oil can make them last years.  I haven't tested this theory yet.  But mineral oil is cheap, so i think it's worth a try.

**EDIT 2:**  *Thank you everyone for the comments.  I know that Harry's and Dollar Shave Club will let you shave for $1.00/week.  And I know double edge safety razors are cheap.  The point this post was two-fold:*

1. *You're changing your blade way too often.  Start some best practices to help make your blades last longer.*
2. *You don't HAVE TO buy a safety razor to get a good cheap shave.  You can continue to use the handle and blade you have in your house now.  Once you use all the blades up that you have now, you can then decide if you want to switch to a safety razor.*
