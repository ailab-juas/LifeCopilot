LPT: If you have an offer for a new job, ask your new employer to honor a vacation you have planned in 2-3 months - even if you don't have the vacation planned yet.

content:
It can be difficult to ask for a vacation when you're settling into a new role, so having one pre-approved on the calendar when you start will force you to take some much-needed time off and ensure that they will allow you to take it. Once you accept the role, you can plan yourself a nice get-away. 

And if they say "no," then that's a good red flag that can influence your decision to join the company.
