LPT : IF you find yourself in a bit of a slump, pay yourself a bit of extra attention. Get a haircut, buy some new clothes. Just that can really help give your confidence a needed boost.

Thanks for all the upvotes and comments.
There is some really positive and motivating advice to be read amongst the comments, great stuff. 
A lot of people have mentioned money as a limiting factor and that's a good point for the particular example I provided in the op, but the general gist of what I'm saying is that when you least feel like getting up, getting dressed and getting out, is when it'll probably do you the most good. 
I wish everyone all the best with their own individual struggles and please seek professional advice if things are really bad.
