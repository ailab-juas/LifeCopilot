LPT: When your dog gets loose, don't chase it; lie down and pretend you're hurt.

content:
If you chase your dog, its instinct is to run. If you lie down on the ground and act hurt (yelping, etc.), its instinct is to come check on you and make sure you're alright. Feels like a dirty trick at the time, but it's worth saving your dog from getting hit.
