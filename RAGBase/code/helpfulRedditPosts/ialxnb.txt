YSK: Some people enjoy chatting with strangers. They value the feeling of being connected to others in their community. Maybe they are lonely, maybe they just feel it is better than treating everyone else as an NPC.

Then again, some people don't like chatting with strangers, don't like sharing personal details with others and can be sensitive about common getting to know you subjects such as your family, the town or country you grew up in etc.

Neither preference is wrong,It's OK to strike up a conversation with a stranger by asking a question. But don't push if the stranger is being evasive.

It's Ok to be evasive, just remember others in our society may enjoy the chance to engage with strangers.

Basically, its all OK if we aren't too pushy or too rude.  


We should know this so we can give different kinds of personalities in our community a chance to be themselves without feeling they are wrong to be friendly or wrong to be reserved
