YSK about a website called eatbydate.com where, for many many foods, they'll tell you how long it can last past its "label date," how to best store it long-term, how to tell if it's gone bad, and what to use it for if you don't want to eat it straight. Great resource for reducing food waste!

I've used it 5-6 times for foods that were way past its "label date," and it turns out they were totally fine to eat.
