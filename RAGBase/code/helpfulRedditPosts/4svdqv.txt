YSK the 2x10 method of breaking through to people who don't like you...

content:
It's a technique used in education to reach "at risk" students with behavior issues but it works equally as well on adults like problematic coworkers or bad neighbors.

Simply spend 2 minutes a day for 10 days straight having a one on one conversation asking about them with nothing to do with the context of how you are connected. I.e ask the problem coworker anything about themselves that has nothing to do with work.

Works like a charm for building relationships with whom you've basically written off.
