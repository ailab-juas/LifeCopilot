title:
LPT- if you're in a discussion/argument with someone and they insult your appearance or character, it's time to stop investing energy in the conversation.

content:
They're not taking the discussion seriously anymore (if they ever were) and you won't get anywhere with them. It's best to just end the conversation politely and put your energy into discussions with people that are actually trying to learn something new or understand your perspective, or a fun hobby or something.
