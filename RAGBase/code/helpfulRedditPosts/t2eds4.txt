LPT: Parking on a higher floor of a garage is almost always a time win

content:
People spend time circling to find a good space on the lower floor(s) of a parking garage, and for all that, often end up away from the elevator with a long walk.  The higher floors are often almost near-empty and you can park nearer the elevator.   

Because of elevators,  the higher floors are really no further than the lower floor and the  ease of finding a good space is often rewarded.
