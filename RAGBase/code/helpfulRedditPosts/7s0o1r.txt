title:
LPT: For dual income couples. If you bought a modest house, use one persons income to go directly to the mortgage for a year or more, and live off one salary. You will dramatically reduce the life of your mortgage and will also know if you can survive on one salary if necessary.

content:
[EDIT]: One salary is for all expenses including regular mortgage payments. The other is for mortgage prepayments and other savings. 

[EDIT]: Changed flair. Probably should not have put it under money and finance as it is not advice to make as much money as possible. I don’t post a lot and didn’t think too hard about the flair. This advice helps pay the mortgage quickly, not make your rich.
