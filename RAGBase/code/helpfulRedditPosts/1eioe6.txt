LPT: Don't exercise before having blood work done.

content:
This may be common knowledge, but it was certainly news to me. I'm getting some blood work done later on today, which required fasting.  A friend of mine mentioned that some results (such as white blood cell count) can be thrown off by exercising prior to having blood drawn.  I did a little research and found some research to [back it up](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/spmj/v121n1/16127.pdf) . Food for thought! (or a glass of water... if you're fasting)
