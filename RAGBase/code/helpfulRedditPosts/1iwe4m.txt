LPT: Put Icy Hot on mosquito bites to quickly get rid of the itch.

content:
I've noticed putting icy hot on mosquito bites helps get rid of the itch pretty quickly. It will slightly sting for a few seconds but avoid touching it. Not sure if this would work for everyone but it has been working for me all summer as well as for the few people I've told it to.
