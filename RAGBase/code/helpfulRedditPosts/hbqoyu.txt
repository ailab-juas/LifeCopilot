LPT, are you stressing over something? Then use the 10-10-10 rule, will it matter in 10 days? 10 months? 10 years? After getting some perspective, you will notice how very few things end up worth stressing over.

Clarification: 

I feel like most are missing the point, this trick helps weed out the not so important issues that clogs your mind and takes up the much needed mental energy, so you can have more time and energy to deal with more pressing issues, like education, work, finances, relationships. Those are the sort of issue that should have more priority over let's say, buying the latest iPhone, or some other materialistic things. 

That is all what the trick is all about
