title:
YSK that some wheelchair users have partial use of their legs, but can't walk entirely. This is why you may see some people in wheelchairs with pedals or even get out of their wheelchair and walk.

I was walking with a friend who scoffed after seeing a people get out of their wheelchair, fold it up, carry it up a small flight of stairs, and then get back into the wheelchair.

People with injuries or diseases that impair the use of their legs often go through some forms of physical therapy or exercise. So, it can be healthy to use your legs throughout the day (such as with pedal-assisted wheelchairs or by walking for short periods).

It sucked that my friend was judging this guy, thinking he may have been brazenly pretending to need a wheelchair.
