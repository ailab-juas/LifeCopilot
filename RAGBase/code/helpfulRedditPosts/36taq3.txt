title:
LPT: a Word file, is a zip in disguise.

content:
Just rename your file from .docx to .zip and unzip. You will get a folder of all stuff inside the doc, like all the images and some crazy xml content.

As a web developer, my clients often send stuff for me to place on their website, mostly in a doc with dozens of pages with images. I got tired of saving every single image from the doc. Too many clickz. Much carpel tunnel.

This saves me a lot of time so I just had to share this awesome trick.

(Don't know what specific versions support this trick, I tested with word for mac 2011. I think it also works with Powerpoint files.)

Edit: Wow, this blew up! Let me express my feelings in a Haiku:  
I got reddit gold.  
Thank you all for the upvotes!  
I can die in peace.  

Edit2: Reformatted the haiku to support line breaks as suggested by /r/ConsummateK (mini-LPT: add 2 spaces behind your returns)
