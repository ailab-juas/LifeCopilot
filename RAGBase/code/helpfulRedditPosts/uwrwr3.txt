LPT: From time to time take random pics with your friends. Not only selfies but also genuinely random pics; moments, memories! Upload the photos to Google Drive. You'll probably forget those photos... but your future self, years from now, will look back at them one day and smile.

Sorry for suggesting Google Drive!! I forgot it makes stuff public, which is not very nice. I just wanted to put something related because I thought someone could comment "Well but I don't have storage on my cellphone for that". Google Photos is definitely better.
