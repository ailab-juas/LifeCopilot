Learn from my infuriating experience!!

Edit: holy crap this thing took off like a rocket ship. I have nothing to add here other than I genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, wish you guys the best of luck on your painting projects. I hope the awful experience I had with painters tape serves as a cautionary tale and hope you donâ€™t make the same mistake I did. :)

Edit 2: almost 42k upvotes. This. Is. Insanity. I knew my undergrad and grad degrees in English would pay off. TAKE THAT MOM AND DAD!!!!!!!!!!

Edit 3: After my rags to riches story where I became a billionaire with this post, my inbox has been dessimated. Currently looking for someone to sift thru it and to only save the nudes. You can find the job posting on LinkedIn if interested. Good luck to all the candidates.

Edit 4: \* Decimated.
