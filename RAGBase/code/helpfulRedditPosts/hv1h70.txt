YSK: eBay reads all your messages, and lower level employees can access your personal contact info.

content:
Former eBay employee here. After all the news that has come out about the execs terrorizing that poor couple, I feel like this is important to share. When I worked at eBay, I could easily read anyone’s messages and see all their personal info just by looking them up by name - and I was customer support at the lowest level. 

eBay supports a culture that could easily lead to stalking. Please consider this when you use any private website - I’m sure it’s no different. 

EDIT: fixed the amp link.
