LPT: There is nothing tacky or wrong about discussing your salary with coworkers. It is a federally protected action and the only thing that can stop discrepancies in pay. Do not let your boss convince you otherwise.

I just want to remind everyone that you should always discuss pay with coworkers. Do not let your managers or supervisors tell you it is tacky or against the rules.

Discussing pay with co-workers is a federally protected action. You cannot face consequences for discussing pay with coworkers- it can't even be threatened. Discussing pay with coworkers is the only thing that prevents discrimination in pay. Managers will often discourage it- They may even say it is against the rules but it never is.
