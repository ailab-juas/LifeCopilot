title:
LPT: In a group setting, if one person is unusually quiet, don’t say “you’re quiet” to them.

content:
You can assume if someone isn’t speaking they just don’t want to. If you’re concerned for their welfare or feel like they’re bringing the mood down, just ask them an engaging question about themselves or something you know they’re interested in. Chances are they know they’re being unusually quiet and you pointing it out to them in front of everyone just makes them more uncomfortable… they may not be able to address what’s bothering them right then and there… Sometimes people just don’t want to talk and that’s ok.
