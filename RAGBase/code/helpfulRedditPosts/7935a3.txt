LPT: Blend dog food and low-sodium chicken broth together and freeze it in a hollow dog toy. It will keep your dog busy and occupied for hours while also providing them a healthier treat.

I definitely want to address some of the most popular comments:

A lot of people have brought up the mess factor, in my experience my dog finishes this well before it melts, if your dog is picky or loses interest in challenging tasks quickly this might not be for them or might need to be an outside only treat.

Also, definitely check your chicken broth for onions, many of you have mentioned that they are bad for doggo. My vet recommended this to me and did not mention this as a concern but I will definitely be taking this into consideration. 

Kong balls/bones work best as they are very difficult for your dog to destroy. 

TL;DR: might be best to give to dogs outside; onions are bad and in broth; Kong Balls are where itâ€™s at!
