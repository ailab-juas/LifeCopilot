title:
LPT: Buy an Air Fryer.

content:
Whether you are a parent with hella kids or a single college student, an air fryer will change your food game.

You can cook sooo many meals in these bad boys about 5x quicker than any other way.

I have kids, and these damn kids LOVE frozen chicken nuggets and other frozen kid shit.

This thing has become my saving grace.

Instead of waiting 10 minutes for the oven to preheat and then spending another 15 minutes actually cooking that shit, I can just toss it all into an air fryer and its done within 8 minutes, its fuckin magic and YOU need one.
