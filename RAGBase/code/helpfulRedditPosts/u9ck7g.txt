LPT: Can't decide on dinner? Use the "veto rule"

content:
This brilliant little rule is used in my house often. I guarantee success.

Scenario (written by a user on a different thread):

**WITHOUT** the veto rule:

&gt;Me: Want to grab some Pizza?  
Her: I don't care.  
Me: What about burgers?  
Her: I don't care.  
Me: We could grab some chicken tenders...  
Her: I don't care.  
Me: OK, let's get the pizza then.  
Her: I don't want pizza.  
Me: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

Instead of this happening, you institute the veto rule, which means that **anyone who vetoes a suggestion has to pay for that veto with a suggestion of their own**. This keeps it from becoming lopsided.

**WITH** the veto rule:

&gt;Me: Want to grab some Pizza?  
Her: Veto. Mexican?  
Me: Nope, sounds awful. What about burgers?  
Her: Nah. Chicken Tenders?  
Me: Agreed.

No tables harmed.
