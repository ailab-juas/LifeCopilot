Quote from beekeeping on tumblr:
&gt; bees are one of the most important animals in the world and their job is a lot more than gathering honey but also because they are what scientists refer to as an “indicator species"

&gt; this means that when their populations start dwindling and then rapidly dropping, humans need to watch their shit because that means that environmental factors are too difficult for THEM to live in, so it might be difficult for US to live in, too. bees basically act as an indication that humans have a lot to worry about and when they start dying like this it deserves a lot more than a few headlines.

&gt; Without bees, we will die off.  Bayer and Monsanto continue to produce the chemicals that have been proven to kill them, and the government has their backs.  Bees pollinate 30% of our food in the US and we are passing legislation to PROTECT the scumbags responsible for killing them.

&gt; your future life without kiwis, cranberries, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, peaches, sunflowers, cotton, apples, plums, pears, mustard, celery, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, beans, cherries, melons, turnips, canola oil, alfalfa, soybeans, lemons, oranges... those will be gone if bees die off. 

&gt; Bees are amazing creatures who are responsible for the comfortable lives we lead in this country and we cannot sustain and feed our population without them.

&gt; Bees are literally some of the most important creatures on this planet. I am not usually one for valuing certain living things over other living things, but bees are an exception. Without bees, the human race wouldn’t even be a thing. You like living? Then you like bees. You like other people staying alive, especially in poorly developed areas, living too? Then you still like bees.

&gt; Same to that, you should love and support Bee Keepers. Seeing Bee keepers lose their hives in such masses is absolutely devastating, because in many cases, bee keepers are the only reason hive roosting social bee species are even still in an area. They don’t just harvest honey. They take care of and maintain their bees tirelessly, and are a boon to the environment as a result, because their busy little honey makers are out there pollinating the fields of nearby flowers and farmers, pollinating small gardens and fruit trees. Bee diseases are also largely unregulated by governments and completely controlled by bee keepers. Never, ever turn your back on a bee keeper. For all you know, they are the heros of the human race, maintaining food production at this very moment.

&gt; Also of concern are farmers planting massive fields of plants with beautiful, alluring flowers that attract honeybees to them, but that do not produce suitable honey for the bees to survive on through winter. Honey that crystallizes very fast, and becomes inedible to the bees as a result. Honeybees that belong to a bee keeper can be artificially fed through winter if the honey stores are bad… but wild honeybees do not have that luxury and the colony will die.

&gt; Want to help somehow? Consider keeping bees yourself, especially if you already have an interest in food production! You can do it on your acres of land, or in your backyard. It can even be done on rooftop apartment gardens. 2 hives will give you many, many lbs of honey, even with two harvests during a good summer. You can also become involved with your local bee keeping groups! However, bee keeping isn’t for everyone. There are much smaller things you can do:

* Have beekeeper and bees in mind when choosing what regulations you support. Be loud about the things you are against!
* Plant a variety of fragrant summer blooms in your garden. Attracting bees is both good for your flowers and good for the bees! The more variety they have, the better their honey will be to support them.
* Consider leaving out water for wild bees. Peat moss lightly flooded in a dish, somewhere out of direct sunlight, is a great place for bees to drink. They will appreciate it, especially in developed areas where water sources are few.
* Don’t treat your garden with pesticides!
* Support your local bee keepers! Buy your honey local from farmer’s markets.
* Can’t find local honey? Buying online from a small time beekeeper is your next best option. Actually, buying from many different regions can give you a variety of honey flavors - different ingredients make different honeys, changing color, taste, and thickness.

I mean shoot, if this isn't the proper place to post this- by all means, tell me. But this happening is REALLY BAD and I haven't seen anything on reddit that addresses this huge problem.
