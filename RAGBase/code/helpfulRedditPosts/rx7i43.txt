LPT: When travelling via plane internationally with your partner. Put a set of clothes in each others bag so on the off chance the airline loses a suitcase, you have at least one fresh set of clothes to change into.

content:
This is literally something completely free that you and your partner/friend/someone else you live with could do so neither of you would end up with no clothes or just one change of clothes you put in your hand luggage/carry on. It would save buying new clothes in a country you may not be familiar with which may also be financially inconvenient. Carry on luggage is also often made to go in the hold so that argument is not valid.

Yes I am aware that luggage going missing is rare but it happens. I have worked at an airport and know people who work at an airport. It happens enough to warrant putting a system in place so that you don't end up without clothes.

You know what, if just one person implements this and it saves them from having to wash skiddies out of their dirty underwear in the sink, I'm happy.
