LPT: Get a trade skill you like, THEN get your education.

content:
The trade skill makes you experienced, the degree bolsters your resume. The system lied to you and said education was everything. The exception is anything like engineer, medical, lawyer, or practical uses for a degree (such as illustrator, educator, accountant, etc).

As an example, if you like painting and art is your deal, get into auto-body or aircraft paint skills, and then bolster your field with a degree. 

This will give you experience, and the degree, and will help propel you to the upper levels.

Edit: my first awards, thanks guys!

Edit 2: folks, not everything is a one size fit all. As someone pointed out in chat a better LPT would be to consider trade over college. There isn’t a single path that can be taken, and there are exceptions to every rule. Learning a trade skill won’t help you in every possible area...but the trade world is hurting and you might be able to pick up a free degree if you’re smart about it and look into the right trades. 

*Do not take things on the internet as the holy grail that will take you to the promised land, but do take a pause and think if college and debt is the right move for you or if you’re better suited to something else. Consider other options*
