LPT: The cashier doesn’t care what you’re buying and has no interest in judging you

content:
Afraid to buy extra large (or extra small) condoms? The cashier doesn’t care.

Hemorrhoid cream? Suppositories? Plan B? 

They don’t care. Nobody cares. Just buy whatever you need and leave. All that anxiety and stress you have about your embarrassing purchase is wasted energy because the cashier is completely divorced from anything other than completing your transaction and getting you out of the store.
