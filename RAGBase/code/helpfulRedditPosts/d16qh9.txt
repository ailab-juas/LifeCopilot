YSK Fake Missing Persons Reports

content:
YSK about fake missing persons reports on social media. They are a tactic abusers use to find their victims. Don't share unverified missing persons reports. Don't share them unless they are or link a police or news report.
Edit: Someone finds the "missing person", calls the police, the police say they don't have a missing persons report for said person, finder messages "loved one" really the abuser and says they found them and sometimes gets an award. Thank you for the precious metals.
