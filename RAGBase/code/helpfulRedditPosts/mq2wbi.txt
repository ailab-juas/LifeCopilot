LPT- Don't skip filling in those annoying applications that ask you to copy paste your resume after you've already attached it. At least, Add keywords from the job description in there.

I used to be a recruiter. 
These applications are annoying, I know, especially when you've already ATTACHED your resume but in a lot of cases, their CRM/data management systems can only pull from these text boxes. 
If they are searching for "python" or "admin assistant", whatever, it will only show results from the "text boxes" you filled. It won't pull from your resume (unless they splurged on a fancy system, which is often not the case.)

Agencies do this, and a lot of companies use this to parse resumes, as well, if they get more than they can feasibly go through. 

If you fill it with "see resume"; "resume attached" or with nothing, you are doing yourself a huge disservice and your resume might get overlooked. 

Add in your job title/dates and then instead of a full description just add keywords (applicable to that role) that you've taken from the job description. 

Ex: 
Administrative assistant -2017-2019
Excel, management, finance, petty cash, filing, phone line, customer service

This will save you time (instead of entering your whole resume) and will give your profile the most "flags" to be reviewed :) 


Happy hunting folks.

*Note: copy pasta-ing your whole resume section by section will yield the best results but 1- ain't nobody got time for that and 2- honestly, adding the keywords that they WILL be searching for is basically the same thing.

**Edit** Thank you guys for the awards and I wish you all luck with your job search.
