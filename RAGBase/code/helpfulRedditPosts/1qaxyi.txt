LPT : The ultimate sleep guide!

content:
Exploit your five sense and your body's natural functions to fall asleep quicker, easier, and more consistently.

Plus, wake up easier, feeling more refreshed, and with less alarm clock dependence.

**Prep**

The following types are actions undertaken throughout the day to help you sleep.

**The generic:**

1) Exercise daily -  Any is better than none, Earlier in the day  is better than later, and getting outside helps

Eat healthy

Cut caffeine, no caffeine after 3/4pm

**More specific**


2) Get out of bed earlier - You haven't been sleeping, and so you are tired, the result you stay in bed later when you have the opportunity. An attempt to catch up.
This is a bad idea. Get up. Sleeping late will make it harder to fall asleep at night, and create a bad habit.


3) Get up at the same time every day, even weekends. - I know people hate this one, but seriously, you will feel more awake and refreshed every day. 
The flip side, go to bed at the same time. Be as consistent as you can.


4) As soon as you hop out of bed, open the curtains (your neighbors will love seeing your naked ass first thing!), and if possible, open a window. The light and fresh air trigger the body's natural circadian rhythm. This will help both for you to feel more awake immediately,  more alert daily, train your body to get up at this time, and help you to fall asleep easier at night. Also, turn on those overhead lights! Cry from the brightness.

Shift workers take note!!

5) Eat breakfast, and eat breakfast earlier- some people do not eat breakfast. I used to be one of them. I actually used to throw up if I attempted to eat too early in the morning.  
Try and eat earlier, preferably with 30 minutes to an hour of waking up


Make breakfast a more significant meal. The best strategy is Breakfast is big, lunch is medium, and dinner is small.  I know this does not fit into many lifestyles, but whatever you can do to shift your calories earlier in the day will help.

6) Stop eating earlier in the evenings. If possible move your dinner earlier, and drop all after dinner snacking. I find a 2 to 3 hour gap between the last food you eat and bed time is best.
This is SUPER important if you want to start eating breakfast! The earlier you stop eating, the easier it is to wake up the next morning, the more awake you feel and the hungrier you are. All of these things help you fall asleep easier the next night.

This has made a huge difference for me. If you have trouble falling asleep on an empty stomach see tip #8. Or, have a small snack, preferably protein (definitely not refined carbs and simple sugars). this will give you the feeling of satiation and not spike your blood sugars. Nuts and seeds are one of the best options!

7) Your bed should be used for two things and two things only, sleep and extracurricular activities. If you are the sort of person who likes to watch TV in bed, watch from the foot of your bed or sideways. 


**Almost Bed time**

My strategy is to exploit the five senses to create a bed time routine that will knock you out quickly and easily.

8) **Taste** : Drink a cup of hot herbal tisane/infusion or hot water. Chamomile,  Valerian, rooibos, etc. Even just hot water (it's nice with lemon). The warmth in your stomach actually helps you sleep. Some tisanes/infusions like Chamomile and Valerian have additional compounds to enhance sleep.

9) **Sight** : One of the most important senses in triggering sleep. You want to reduce light, not just at bed time but hours before. 1 or two hours before bedtime, start turning off lights. Make sure to turn off any overhead lights, and switch to task lighting for what you are doing.

I use flux for my computer. It makes a big difference by reducing the blue tones that keep you up.  [Flux](http://justgetflux.com/) I've been using it for nearly 2 years. Seriously awesome!

10) Minimize light when sleeping. I recommend a sleep mask. They may look silly, but you will fall asleep significantly faster and remain asleep more consistently. If this is not an option, get rid of all lights. Black out curtains, stickers over lights and indicators on electronics, etc.

11) Meditate -  I know most people won't take up meditation, but it does make a huge difference. It can also help with motivation and will power.  It can be done at ANY time of the day too. 10-15 minutes in recommend, but even 5 will help!

**Bedtime**

The time when you are physically ready to get into bed

12) **Sight and sound** : Right as you about to go to sleep, maybe in the 5 to ten minutes leading up, play a relaxation video. Do this ONLY if your computer is on anyway, I am constantly on mine. (really you should turn all electronics off for an hour+ before bedtime. Realistically, it's never going to happen.


The video can be passive watching. You do not have to sit there. Just let it play as background noise while you brush your teeth/put on pj's/ whatever the hell you do before you hop into bed.


Use the same type of sounds, if not the exact same video/music every evening. You will train your body to expect sleep when it hears the sounds.


13) **Touch** : A cool room and warm bed is the most conducive to sleep. 


14) **Smell** : this is an under utilized sense in sleep routines. I have a whole scent routine that can help you sleep not only at night, but in other situations where it may be advantageous (such as flying/jet lag). 

Pick a relaxing smell you enjoy. use something with that scent as you are climbing into bed/falling asleep.

There are pillow sprays for this purpose. I use a hand cream and lip balm. It's something I do every night before I go to sleep, so I take advantage by using a relaxing scent.
Only do this scent when you are about to sleep. Not at any other time during the day, and not on evenings when you know you are going to be awake and restless.

15. Masturbate -  &gt; joetromboni

truth! Orgasms actually release stress relieving chemicals. So, get busy before nodding off! (oh, but don't do this everyday, you don't want masturabtion to be the ONLY way you can get to sleep... Makes it very awkward if you have to share a room with someone!)

**tl;dr?**

1.  Exercise/eat healthy/ Cut caffeine

2. Get up earlier even when you are tired

3. Get up at the same time daily, even weekends

4. Turn on lights/get fresh air as soon as you wake up

5. Eat a big breakfast

6. Eat a small dinner/ no after dinner snacking

7. Use bed for only sleep and sex

8. Drink hot water or Herbal tea before bed

9. turn off lights for 2-3 hours before bed

10. wear a sleep mask

11. Meditate

12. Listen/watch the same relaxation video/music daily just prior to bed

13. Keep your bedroom slightly cool, and uses blankets for warmth

14. Create a scent routine
15. Masturbate

Edits:

#1 added #15

#2 adjusted herbal tea terminology to  herbal tisane/infusion. In no way do I mean to 
suggest one should drink black/green/white/oolong or other caffeinated beverages before bed. Instead, herbal drinks without any caffeine.

#3 fleshed out a few points (tee hee fleshed out)

#4 **what the hell food**
Y'all seem to think I am crazy about #5 and #6. There is some research behind it.

And I am not saying people have to change their whole life and all their eating behaviours, but if one is aware that when you eat has an impact on sleep, well it is one more factor you can adjust if need be!
