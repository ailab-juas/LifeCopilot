LPT - It's tax season, so make sure you don't waste money on Turbotax. Turbotax is wildly overpriced and you're wasting a lot of money when you could use Freetaxusa and other services that are literally over a hundred dollars cheaper. Freetaxusa is $15 to file your state return - federal is free.

Turbotax AT MINIMUM costs $89 for federal (which is free on freetaxusa), and $39 for state (which is $15 on freetaxusa), and if you have any investments or other extras to your taxes, you have to upgrade to some bullshit extra level in Turbotax so filing usually costs between $150 and $200. Don't do it. Turbotax is a trap. That's all.
