LPT: If you work at a sedentary job, drink plenty of water throughout the day and use the restroom farthest away from you or on a different floor.

content:
Also, if you get 15 min breaks throughout the day, use them to take a walk. If you get an hour lunch break, take your lunch to a park and use the second half hour to take a walk or stretch. Use the farthest away kitchen/fridge/ice machine. Steps add up.


I know some of these may not be accessible to everyone, like those that work at a very small building or somewhere where walking isn't safe or weather compatible. Try to be creative. 


If anyone notices you employing these tips and tries to give you shit, mention whatever pain you probably have and say it's necessary to maintain your health. It's very reasonable accommodation for a workplace to allow, especially if they're providing health insurance and it's in their best interest. Get a diagnosis in the lowest cost way you can if necessary.


For those of you at an overly active job, do the opposite. SIT on that dang toilet as long as you can get away with. Etc.


For anyone about to comment some bullshit about productivity, keep in mind that worker productivity has increased dramatically over the years. Wages have not kept up respectively even with inflation let alone with productivity. Time to start taking care of ourselves. Your employer doesn't give a fuck.
