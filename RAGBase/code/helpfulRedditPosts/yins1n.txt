YSK: Don't try to be nice and let others in when it is your right of way

content:
Why YSK: This causes confusion and can lead to accidents. Road rules are there because we can't talk to each other, and hand guestures aren't a great way to communicate your intent.

This has happened to me twice this month already, and both times have lead to this exact same scenario, interrupting the flow of traffic and making the situation less safe.

Extra points: 

Please do not get mad at the other person if they don't take you up on your well-intended guesture. I get it can be frustrating if the other person isn't a mind reader or they don't react in time, however, you are in the wrong. They might not feel safe proceeding or unable to do so for whatever reason. By doing this, you make the situation unpredictable, and that can cause some to freeze or question, not a good thing on the road.
