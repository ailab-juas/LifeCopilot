LPT: You don’t have to answer your front door when you’re home.

content:
If a door to door sales person or someone you don’t know is at your door, you don’t have to acknowledge their presence, even if it’s clearly apparent that you are home.  If it’s important then they will shout what they are their for, like if it’s a neighbor you haven’t met yet and your roof is on fire.  It’s your home and there is no obligation that you have to answer the door for everyone that comes knocking.
