YSK about a phone scam recently surfacing. If you get a call that only rings once or twice and hangs up, don't call back.

I recently heard about this scam where people (or a machine) will call you, and immediately hang up. When you call back, they will charge huge amounts per minute for your call. (And minutes are usually rounded up, so if you are on the line for only a few seconds, you'll get charged for a full minute each time you call) If you find weird charges on your bill, always call your phone company.
