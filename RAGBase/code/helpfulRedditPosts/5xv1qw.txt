title:
YSK that if your adjusted gross income is less than $64,000 you probably qualify for free tax filing software for both your federal AND state taxes. (US only)

content:
The IRS has a tool that will allow you to input some basic information about yourself (age, income, state, AGI) and it will provide a list of all efile software that will allow you to file your taxes for free and the requirements for free filing with that software. 

[Here's the link.](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp)

Also note that you never **have** to pay to file your taxes. Even if you make over $64,000, you can always fill out the forms yourself (either with paper, or with [free fillable forms](https://www.irs.gov/uac/before-starting-free-file-fillable-forms)).
