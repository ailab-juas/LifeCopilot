[LPT] Imagine your future self as a dear friend in every action you do

content:
Research has recently shown that [we consider our future self as an entity other than ourselves](http://nautil.us/issue/9/time/why-we-procrastinate). I figured why not use this effect and reframe it in such a was as to benefit us to prevent procrastination and continuing bad habits. Usually "the now" counts so much more in our reptile brains so every trick we can use to suppress that is likely to benefit us in our modern society.

The trick would be to imagine your future self as someone you love, a dear friend you want everything good for, which lives far away and you're going to see soon. Attempt to make a habit of considering all actions you perform and in which way they would affect this friend. Every bad habit you have, drinking soda, eating fast food, procrastinating a task, having a messy place, etc., counts as this friend doing you favor. The bigger the impact on this friend, the bigger the favor he's doing you. Try to imagine it strongly and attempt to do "the right thing" instead of leeching off your friend.

Edit: Added link to the research I mentioned. Thank you [hermioneweasley](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1vo4n0/lpt_imagine_your_future_self_as_a_dear_friend_in/ceudaq2) for finding it again and sharing. It was posted on reddit a few days ago, that's when I had the idea.
