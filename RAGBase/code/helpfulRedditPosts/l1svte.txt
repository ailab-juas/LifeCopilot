title:
YSK that opening someone else's mail is a felony.

content:
Why YSK: From abusive parents to nosy neighbors, the stuff you order is YOUR STUFF. If it has your name on it and someone else opens it without your permission, even if they don't take anything, you can report them. It sounds like a karenistic thing to do, I know, but privacy is important.

Opening someone's mail without their permission can open you up (pun intended) to five years in federal prison.

Edit: I should have clarified that if you open it by accident, it doesn’t count. You won’t get in trouble if you didn’t mean to do it.
