LPT: If you like ramen noodles, try shopping at an Asian grocery. They carry better brands than your standard American supermarket.

content:
It may cost up to 4x the cost... so, a dollar, but they usually have 2-4 different flavor packages, and are generally a superior product.

EDIT: thank you everyone for the flair and awards. And for the haters, please understand that people don’t know about things they have never experienced, and growing up black in rural Georgia,  I never went to an Asian supermarket, I didn’t even know such markets existed until I was a young man. As an adult, it never occurred to me to go to one in the first place. Maybe don’t shame people for not knowing things about cross cultural experiences. Go try something new!
