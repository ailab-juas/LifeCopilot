LPT: If you have to use a payphone, USE CASH

content:
If you don't have your cell or your phone is dead and you see "4 minutes for 1 dollar" payphones, use cash / coins.  They don't advertise it anwhere, but if you use your credit card, they will charge you ridiculous rates (literally, I was once charged $20 / min).
