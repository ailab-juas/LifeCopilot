LPT: Dial a number with an extension often? Save the number with two commas between them. Example: 555-555-5555,, 123456

content:
If you put two commas after the phone number followed by the extension, your phone will call the number, pause, then dial the extension.


Edit 1: Thanks to u/vonaudy who explained how it works.
Each comma is 2 second pause, so you can place 3 commas to have it wait 6 seconds before sending the extension.

You could also take multiple breaks like 
555-555-5555,,7,,,,,45,,7890#

And thanks to u/bizzattles for mentioning the semi colon which prompts you on screen to send the extension when you want to.

Edit 2: credit to u/provanilla. To get the comma key when on the dial pad, you need to press and hold the * key.

Edit 3: removed spaces after commas. Stupid phone...

Edit 4: Thanks for the Platinum and gold kind strangers.
