title:
YSK Very often Technical Schools that offer a welding program typically offer an accelerated program that can finish in just a few weeks. If you need a decent paying job in relatively short time frame this is a great path.

Why YSK: Welders are in demand all over the country. Starting wages can vary by quite a bit but if you find yourself in a financial and/or career pinch this path could help.

Many people are scared away from a path like this because they didnt grow up with it and they have zero experience but I want to stress that these technical programs are designed to teach someone from the ground level. You can enter completely ignorant and leave completely qualified.
