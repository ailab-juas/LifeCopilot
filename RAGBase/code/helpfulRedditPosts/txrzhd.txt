YSK: if you get out of your car to go yell at another driver, you've already lost.

Why YSK: Driving can induce road rage. If you are raging and feel justified to get out of your car at a red light to walk up to another car, stop, get back in your car, and keep going. Take the high road (lol). You never know if the idiot pissing you off has a loaded gun or is equally hyped up ready to fight. It's never worth it. 

Also, you're holding up traffic and look like the bigger asshole, always.
