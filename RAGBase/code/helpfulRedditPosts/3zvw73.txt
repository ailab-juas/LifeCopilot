LPT: Turn your headlights on in any type of inclement weather even if you can see fine

content:
Its day 3 of rain in Socal and I'm still seeing people without their headlights on. They're not for you to see, they're for others to see you better in any type of weather. I shake my head at people driving around in (dense) fog without headlights. Save yourself the incident.

Edit: So many people saying it's the law. Clearly not everybody knows this as evident from those without lights on. This is for them. Obviously the only real solution is for everybody to sell their cars and get new ones with daytime running lights and/or automatic lights.
