content:
The advantage of downloading a sample ballot ahead of time is that you can avoid a lot of confusion when confronted with ballot initiatives, judges, or whateve else you may not have been expecting to see and haven't researched how to vote. [Ballotpedia can help you out here](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup). 

Or, you can google 'sample ballot 2018 *[your location]*' if Ballotpedia is missing yours for some reason. 

To figure out where to vote, go to https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/

EDIT: Per request, I'd like to point that you can also avoid potential scheduling conflicts/ long lines by [voting early in many states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx#Early%20Voting%20Law%20Table).
