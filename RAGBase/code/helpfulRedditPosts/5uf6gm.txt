YSK if you purchased a new car with GAP insurance and sold/traded it in before your loan term was over you may be entitled to a decent refund.

I purchased a Dodge Charger in 2014 and recently traded it in. I cancelled my GAP insurance and I received a $1,000 check. I feel most people purchase GAP insurance when they purchase a new car and not everyone may know this. 

Im in CA if that makes a difference.
