HOMEMADE LAUNDRY DETERGENT
---------------------------------

We make our own. It takes 20-30 minutes of your life (tops) and costs $20 for the entire year. All ingredients can be found at Publix, on Amazon, Walmart, etc.

- 1 bar Fels Naptha

- 1 bar pink Zote

- 2 cup Borax

- 2 cup Arm &amp; Hammer Washing Soda

Grate the bar soaps with a cheese grater. Combine with powders and pulse in a food processor til a uniform powder. We bought an old food processor from Goodwill for $7 and use an old, rusted cheese grater. Store in a large tupperware with a lid.

- 2-3 Tbsp. per load is plenty.

- For cold and gentle cycles, first dissolve the powder in a cup of hot water and dilute with a cup of cold water before adding to the machine. (Sometimes the bar soap granules don't want to dissolve in cold water alone.)

It took us 10 months to go through our first batch. We just ran out on Wednesday...and I wash a LOT of laundry.

EDIT: /u/skim-milk pointed out that you might need a lot less. Start with 1 Tbsp. and adjust up or down as needed.
