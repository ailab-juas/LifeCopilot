LPT: When asking someone to take a picture of you, choose someone taller than you.

content:
By choosing someone taller it will give a better, slightly higher angle. If you choose someone shorter it will cause you to slightly look down at the camera. 

Edit: this is more so to eliminate the double chin look. By looking down at the camera some people get a double chin look even though they don't have one
