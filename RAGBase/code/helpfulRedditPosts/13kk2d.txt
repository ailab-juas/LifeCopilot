LPT: This is the video of the "golf ball in the tub drain" thing with the 'SURPRISE!' I was talking about.

content:
Hey everyone, OK, [here is the quick video I made for you guys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdmgLxqEmtk&amp;feature=plcp) (3:00m) in response to all the comments and queries from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/13gkfc/lpt_taking_a_bath_in_cold_weather_dont_drain_the/c73uqz9) about how using a golf ball in the tub will help the water drain slow enough for it to leave most of its heat in your home. 

Please note that there was only about 6cm of water in the tub in this video. It only went up to the base of my fingers when I stuck my hand in (left out of the video, oops). It's a brand new golf ball for this video, and the ball I originally used was VERY scuffed up, which I think also helps ensure the bathtub is fully drained by morning. You could also put one of those tiny rubber bands around the middle to make it drain a little faster (I'm embarrassed to admit that I experimented with that, nerd that I am), as sometimes I would come in in the morning and the tub would still have a little bit of water.

Also, there's no tricks... this isn't one of those 'trick' or 'stunt' tubs in any way. :) It really will flip around the drain for almost a minute (or even more if there's a lot of water).

Please note that I don't think this will save the planet or is otherwise significant in any way... I was just goofing around, trying to save some heat on a -30C day, and in the process noticed an unexpected physics quirk at 6am in the shower. Thanks!
