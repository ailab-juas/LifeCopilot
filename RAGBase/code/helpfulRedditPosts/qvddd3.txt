LPT: Stop thinking about "who's fault is it" start thinking about "who's responsibility is it".

Life is hard man, and its not fair at all.

that doesnt change the fact that you have to get up, and get it done.

it sucks that your car broke down, or your boss doesnt like you, or whatever.

but you are the one who has to get to work anyway, and make that money, or find a new job that makes you a happier person.

when   you stop looking for someone to blame, and start looking to solutions   to your problems you become one of those success stories where people   talk about "rising in the face of adversity".

get it done son.
