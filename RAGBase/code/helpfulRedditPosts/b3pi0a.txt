LPT:When getting engaged or married go to Pawn Shops for your Jewelry.

content:
It will save you literally hundreds if not thousands of dollars on simple wedding bands and elaborate diamond rings. Resizing a ring is also relatively cheap. Anywhere from $10-$30 from a local jewelry store or Mom and Pop store. Stores like Zales and Jared want you to think that you are buying brand new “untainted” diamonds and gold.In reality you are buying recycled gold and diamond that actually came from Pawn Shops and other used jewelry.  The jewelry that is sold in Pawn Shops has a shelf life that varies but once it has been rotating for a set time and can’t sell the Pawn Shops sell it for the gold weight. The diamonds are taken out and sold in bulk while the gold is melted down into ingots then Jewelry manufactures bid on these materials that are then used to create brand new rings and settings from these recycled materials. 

EDIT:First Gold &amp; Silver EVER!!!! THANK YOU kind strangers!!!
