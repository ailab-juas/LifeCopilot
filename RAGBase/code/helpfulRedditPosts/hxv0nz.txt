title:
YSK that the "History" channel is full of conspiracy theories and unreliable pseudo pop science

content:
I wasted a lot of my teen years watching the history channel taking everything in their programming as "facts". Only to grow up and understand that their "programming" is more often than not just a bunch of unproven conspiracies or dumbed-down pop science that is only meant to keep you glued to the TV. It's entertainment under the guise of history. And a lot of suit-and-tie men/women just spewing nonsense.

I saw a clear difference when I started picking up books and watching actual history lectures online. Those are boring, but at least won't make you look/sound dumb when you start having conversations about history with people.

If you're the type that really loves to learn, consider picking up a textbook and go from there. Trust me real history is already way more interesting than all that overacted cinematic crap that they try to sell us on these channels. 

Textbooks &gt; Books &gt; Lectures &gt; Historian/Researcher interviews

Talking(whenever possible) to witnesses/survivors of historical "events" can also teach you a lot. 

Read articles from reputable journals and websites.

Also learn to differentiate conspiracy theories from proven facts. 

Last but definitely not least, if you can travel! A lot of old practices/buildings/monuments are still immortalized(whether consciously or by chance) by a lot of modern societies around the world.
