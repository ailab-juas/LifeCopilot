LPT: If you’re ‘bad at conversation’ just ask questions. People love to talk about themselves, they think they are extremely unique and interesting, even people you might like to be friends with.

I’m pretty introverted.  But I’ve decided that people are interesting, so I just ask questions and listen and ask more questions and people generally seem to like that.  And don’t worry, people rarely ask a question about you, so you’re off the hook there.
