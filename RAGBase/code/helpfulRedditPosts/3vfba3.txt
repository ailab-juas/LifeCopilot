LPT: Gifting a new console for Xmas? Open it and download updates and patches NOW before the gift is wrapped and under the tree.

content:
Xbox Live and Playstation Network notoriously slow to a crawl and sometimes go down completely on Christmas from thousands of newly connected consoles all trying to download at once.

Not only will system updates be unavailable or painfully slow, but most pack-in games are vouchers for 30GB+ downloads that already take hours to complete, and will take all day if not longer to download on Christmas Day.

If you're giving a console to someone, open it, get it set up, and download the software and any necessary updates now so it's ready to enjoy on Christmas.  

Added bonus is you'll make sure the console is in working order ahead of time so if you're unlucky enough to get a defective console there is time to exchange it before the holiday.
