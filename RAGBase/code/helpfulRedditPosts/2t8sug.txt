title:
YSK that if you're going to school at least half time, your school will issue you a 1098-t form which would make you eligible for some pretty awesome tax credits.

content:
I know, the people that already take advantage of this are probably thinking "duh", but I was surprised to find out that almost none of my friends knew of this and have likely missed out on thousands of dollars in tax credits. If you're a full time student, every bit helps so you should take full advantage. The [American Opportunity Credit](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Tax-Deductions-and-Credits/What-are-Education-Tax-Credits-/INF14427.html) will pay up to 2500 dollars to those that qualify. 

[Here](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/AOTC) is the official information on the IRS website for those interested.

Edit: should have specified in the title that this is a US thing.
