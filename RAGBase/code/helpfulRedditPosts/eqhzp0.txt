LPT: Reustaurant owners, keep you website updated with menus and prices. Also, do the same on google maps

I basically use only google maps to choose the places i wanna go. But usually more than half of the restaurants doesnt show their menu with prices online. And therefore, i never opt for this places, because i dont know how much i should expect to pay
