LPT: Set a shutdown timer in windows with no external software

content:
Open command prompt and type:

    shutdown -s -t XXXXX

Where XXXXX is the number of seconds until shutdown (eg. 3600 for 1 hour).

Can also be used to restart or force shutdown with -r and -f

Great for downloading stuff over night or when you're leaving the house and don't want to leave the computer on all day/night.
