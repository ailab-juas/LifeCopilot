LPT: If your internet provider supplies a modem and router, they are probably "leasing" it to you for a monthly fee. Buy your own modem and/or router and save long term.

My dad had Time Warner Cable, and not only were they charging him $4 a month to lease the equipment, they were also charging $6 a month for a "wireless fee." 

Meaning since they controlled the router web interface, they could do whatever they liked.

We bought our own equipment and haven't looked back. Plus, if you're even a little tech savvy, you can really get a boost out of your new stuff.
