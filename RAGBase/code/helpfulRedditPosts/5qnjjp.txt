LPT: Add your representative's office numbers to your phone's contacts. It makes calling them all the easier whenever you read news about what they're doing.

Congressman typically, at least in the US, keep a running tab of the number of calls they get in favor or in opposition to political issues. And they really can change the way a representative was going to vote. Remember a few weeks back when Republicans were planning on gutting the Congressional Ethics Office? Phone calls from constituents is what got them to back peddle.

For example, my representative, Dennis Ross, posted to Facebook that he had reintroduced legislation for a fence at the US/Mexico border. Normally, I would have just posted a comment to the status, but since I had his phone number I called his office right away. His secretary picked up my call, asked how she could help, and I told her that "I heard on Facebook that Congressman Ross is reintroducing some legislation regarding a fence along the border." "That's correct," she responded. I asked "When did Ross get the check from Mexico? Because I don't want to pay for it." "It's actually paid for with money that was appropriated back in 2006, so you won't be paying anything for it," she explained. "That doesn't mean I won't be paying anything for it, it means that I already have. I'd rather have my money back or have it used on another project, just about anything other than this nonsense. Reagan told Gorbachev to tear down his wall and I'm supposed to be okay with one being built here?" She took my information, told me that she would pass the information along to the congressman, and said goodbye.
