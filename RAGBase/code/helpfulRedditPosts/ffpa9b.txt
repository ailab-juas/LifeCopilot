title:
YSK that you can set a timer on iPhones to stop your music after a set amount of time

content:
Go to the Clock app —&gt; Timer —&gt; When Timer Ends —&gt; scroll to the bottom —&gt; Stop Playing

Now you can shuffle your music and play music for an hour before it automatically shuts off, hopefully after you’ve fallen asleep.
