LPT - if you have young kids, make sure Santa uses a special wrapping paper.

content:
When I was about 6 I figured out that Santa used the exact same wrapping paper and ribbons as my parents.

Keep the magic alive and get a special roll just for Santa.

Edit: for those saying "just don't pretend that Santa is real" - that's a totally valid way of parenting/celebrating Christmas! I'm putting this here for those who choose to pretend while the kids are young, since it was how I grew up.
