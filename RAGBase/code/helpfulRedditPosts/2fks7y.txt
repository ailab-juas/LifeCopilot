LPT: Put your children's snacks in a small bowl instead of eating from the bag. This easily limits portions of unhealthy snacks, teaches them portion size, and prevents mindless eating.

Most children will eat because they are bored and it gives them something to do.  Never let them eat from the box or bag, this guarantees they will eat more than a serving because it is there.  Instead, at a young age, designate some small (6-8 oz) bowls as "special snack bowls". [My favorites here](http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Snack-Catchers-Colors-Vary/dp/B000GB0NZK)

Make them brightly colored with handles or with their favorite cartoon character and put them on a lower shelf to make them easily accessible to place their snacks in.  This makes portion control easy and a lifelong habit, without having to shame the child because they ate too much.  My daughter is 6 and she still does this.  It takes the guesswork out of it, and prevents overeating.
