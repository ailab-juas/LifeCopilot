title:
LPT: if you aren't already, start brushing your teeth using both hands. You'll hit different spots and different angles than just brushing your teeth with your dominant hand. You'll also get the added benefit of training your non-dominant hand.

This helped me a while back when I hurt my dominant hand and was unable to brush my teeth. Luckily, I was already comfortable brushing my teeth with my non-dominant hand. I also noticed that my teeth felt cleaner when I brushed with both hands. I realized that I was stuck in a pattern of only brushing a certain way with one hand, and switching it up made me teeth feel cleaner.

Edit: yeah, I realize now I could have worded the title better. I didn't mean to hold the toothbrush with BOTH hands at the same time.
