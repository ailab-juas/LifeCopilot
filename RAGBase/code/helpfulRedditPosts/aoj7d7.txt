LPT: You must learn to be happy alone to be able to be happy with someone else. Do not have the mindset that another person is the key to your happiness.

content:
Friend went through another breakup and is broken, having to help him get back on his feet, I said these words to him and he understood a bit better that he needs to find his own happiness first. 

Edit: Wanted to include this if you are already in a relationship. You may have found someone that makes you happy but also form your own happiness through hobbies activities and other interests.
