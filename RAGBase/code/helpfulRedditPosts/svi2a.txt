I've worked at grocery stores for my entire adult life from stocking shelves, to brokerage sales, to distribution and I learned a little trick to buying "store brand" items. [x-post from /r/frugal]

**Hey, [/r/lifeprotip](/r/lifeprotip) -ers, I was told to cross post this here, I don't read this subreddit often, so if this is not acceptable or bad material, please accept my apologies and have the mods remove it**

So, I've always worked with fresh departments (meat, deli, bakery, produce) so that is where my example is going to come from. 

Store brand items are rarely made by 'cheaper' companies in grocery chains.  Usually a large brand will repackage the store brand item so they can get more items and facings in the store and preferential treatment from corporate buyers when selling new items (or even discounted/waved slotting fees, which is huge).  The ingredients of the store brand item won't be EXACTLY the same as the name brand BUT it will still have the same level of quality, which is what a lot of people are worried about when buying store brand.

OK, on to the trick.  I'm sorry if most people already know this in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) **(now [/r/lifeprotips](/r/lifeprotips)!)** but no one I have talked to has, so I'm sharing it.

Lets say I'm having a cookout and need to buy bratwurst but the high quality Johnsonville Brats are 2 dollars more expensive per pack than the store brand and I need to keep prices low but keep the quality of my meats for the BBQ high (so my friends don't think I'm a cheap ass... but the PBR might give that away...).

[Here is a picture of a package of Johnsonville Brats](http://i.imgur.com/phH8p.jpg) Do you see the small circle above "Previously handled frozen for your protection, refreeze or refrigerate"?  That is the serial number for the factory/slaughterhouse where the meat was packaged (in this case 34225).  **edit 3** FDA regulation, all meat products are marked with serial number so you know where they came from in case of contamination.

Even the biggest names only have handful of places that will package their product and (usually) only one that will handle the grocery chains in your region.  That location will also handle/package the store brand items.  

SO, match the serial number on a name brand meat product that you know to be quality with the store brand meat product of a similar type.  If they are the same, you have found who actually makes the store brand item.  It takes a little while to find out exactly who is making what, but it will save you money if you are looking for quality along with low prices.

**edit** Someone in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) said this was like excessive coupon cutting, meaning that is wasted time for not much money saved.  I disagree, if you pick up a meat item weekly it really isn't hard to look at the store brand 5 feet away and compare serial numbers.  If the same company you are loyal to makes it!  Awesome, you can buy store brand instead and enjoy the same quality.

**edit 2** P.S. I've worked with 8 grocery chains (actually in their stores/offices) in 9 states in 3 regions, and the best?  Who has the best prices for the most quality product AND treats their employees the best?  Trader Joes, hands-fucking-down the best god damned operation I've seen in these United States of America.


**edit 4** Ok, I hate when redditors do that whole "I'm going to edit this popular post and be total douchebag" thing.  But I just created [/r/grocerystores](/r/grocerystores) and I'll be updating it regularly with grocery store reviews, hopefully more posts like this one, and other tips, also a place to bitch about working in a grocery store and making connections.  Join me or don't, I just really think it would be good for me to actually start documenting what I've found out about the grocery industry (as banal as I'm sure some of you think it is, it is my life and I'm rolling with it).  Peace.
