LPT: if you are feeling depressed or you are in a bad mood, CLEAN

content:
As a person who suffers a lot from depression, i cant explain the weight that is lifted from my shoulders whenever i go to sleep and my bed is made, whenever i wake up to see my dishes all cleaned or whenever i walk in my home and the floor is swiped. 
This advice goes especially to those young adults who just moved from your parents house and are figuring out how to live on your own. 

If you are cooking, while you wait do the dishes.
As soon as you wake up, make your bed. 
Take a piece of clothe off, put it away, don’t throw it on your bed or the floor.
This few things will change your life radically for the better if you are not doing them. 

Tidy surroundings —&gt;tidy mind

Learnt about it the hard way.
