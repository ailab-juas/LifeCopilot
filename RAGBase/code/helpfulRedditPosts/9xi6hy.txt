title:
YSK That there are 7+ albums of GOOD Christmas music that they won’t play on the radio.

content:
There are actually more Christmas music than the same 12 songs that come on the radio. It’s on Spotify, the albums are called “a very special Christmas.” There’s pop, rock, jazz, and even rap covers of classics AND brand new Christmas songs. My favorite is “Oi to the world” by no doubt and Santa Baby by Madonna. Check it out guys, happy holidays. 

Edit: There’s also twisted Christmas by twister sister, and August burns red does a cover of carol of the bells. I’ll post more if I think of more.
