LPT: Write down your favorite memories. Don't think you won't forget them. In 20 years, you'll be glad you did.

content:
My wife and I have a shared Google doc that we use to write down our favorite memories/inside jokes/cute thoughts we have about each other.   
  
For example, my favorite moment from our first year of marriage was the very first Christmas morning together. I wrote it down in great detail when I knew it all.  

When we're older, we will be very happy that we kept such a good record.
