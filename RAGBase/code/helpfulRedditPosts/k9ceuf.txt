LPT: Holding someone accountable is what ensures they won’t repeat an incorrect action. Letting people off without any consequences is what ensures they will repeat their mistakes. Hold people accountable and you will make them better.

A better phrasing of the last line of this post would be “and you can empower them to be their best”

To clarify for many who seem to be misinterpreting this —- consequence does not inherently mean punishment, it means any and all response to clarify to the person that the action was incorrect and to needs to be modified with clarity around the ideal modification. It may include punishment, but only if necessary.

Further clarification —- this assumes that you are on in the right and are doing this in an ethical and above board manner that allows the person to be both heard and respected as is suitable relevant to their specific actions taken.

Further further - good accountability helps people reach their full potential and is not a net negative but a net positive. Coaching is a form of accountability.
