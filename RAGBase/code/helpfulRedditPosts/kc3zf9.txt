YSK that when you go through a drive thru, you will usually still be close to the employee serving you. You should still wear a face covering as if you were standing next to them.

Why YSK: Just because you’re in your car, it doesn’t mean that something can’t be transmitted to the employee. If there’s no plexiglass barrier between you and the employee(s), you should wear a face covering out of respect.

For the people who don’t believe in the recent events, this post isn’t aimed towards you, you guys won’t wear one regardless where you are. This is for people who have truly cared about other people’s well-being and have been wearing a face covering in public spaces. 

I’ve mentioned this to a few of my friends who wear face coverings in public, and they haven’t realized that going through drive thrus is essentially the same thing as standing next to the person. Ever since I brought it up to them, they started wearing one when they go through drive thrus.
