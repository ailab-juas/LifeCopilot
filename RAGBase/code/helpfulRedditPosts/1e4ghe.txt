Accidental LPT by my one year old son: vacuum 2-3 tablespoons of cinammon. It will make your place smell amazing everytime you do the cleaning up.

My son was exploring the drawers in the kitchen and spilled a shitload of ground cinammon on the floor. We cleaned it up with vacuum and immediately it filled the entire kitchen with great scent of warm cinammon.

Sometimes destruction and chaos lead to great discoveries :D
