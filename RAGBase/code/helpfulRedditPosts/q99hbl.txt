LPT: "Dressing sharp" doesn't necessarily mean wearing a suit: buy clothing that fits you well, wear pieces of clothing that go well with each other and marvel at the difference it makes

content:
You can look amazing in casual clothing and even a 5000 dollar suit can look like you're wearing a costume. Buy clothing that fits you *well*. Not too tight, not too loose.

If it doesn't fit off the rack, get it adjusted or adjust it yourself (taking in a shirt a bit is very easy if you have a sewing machine). Also, pay attention how different pieces of clothing complement each other. Fit. Is. King. I can't stress this enough. In case of a plaid shirt worn over a plain T-shirt with jeans and brown leather boots, for example, the biggest difference between "*rugged outdoorsy look*" and "*college kid trying to look edgy look*" is fit.
