LPT: If you are the only one trying to maintain a friendship, they aren't your friend and your time and energy would be better spent somewhere else.

EDIT: If someone is clearly depressed, prefers alone time, or needs your help before something bad happens, this is not the tip for you to follow. Please reach out to that person and let them know you care. I've been on that end and it is so reassuring to hear from someone even if you don't feel like being around anyone.

But if you have friends who you consistently try to make plans with, they decline or take a rain check with a "oh we'll have to hang out soon" and never get back with you, yet you see them out with other friends all the time, then yes, this is very applicable. You deserve better friends.
