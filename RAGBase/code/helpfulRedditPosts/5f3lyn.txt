title:
LPT: Crumple your aluminum foil for crispier frozen fries that are easier to flip.

content:
Crumpling the foil crinkles it, so it has less surface area to make contact with the fries.  This makes them stick less, crispier and less likely to be burnt.  Also works with taquitos, fishsticks and other types of lazyman's food.

Edit: jebus this blew up. From the comments:

Alright, it's aluminium... the one time autocorrect failed me.

No, were not frying the fries, nor using cooling racks!

It's been debunked, though I still notice a difference.

None of this matters because aluminum is toxic and parchment paper is better!

Edit 2: Front page while I was asleep.  (There's a lounge!)

Edit III: aluminum is right too.  We're good again, autocorrect.
