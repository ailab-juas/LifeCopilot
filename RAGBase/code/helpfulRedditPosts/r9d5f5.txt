LPT if you don't get a raise equal to inflation you're taking a pay cut. If you get a raise equal to inflation you're being paid the same. Demand a raise above inflation.

For those of you who don't understand inflation take this simple example into account. 

If a fast food meal cost you $10 in 2021 and the inflation for 2021 is 5%, in 2022 the same meal should cost about $10.50.

Let's say you made $10/hr in 2021 and receive a .25/hr raise, or 2.5% going into 2022. That same fast food meal used to cost you an hour of work, now it cost more than an hour. 

A minimal increase in this scenario but this will apply to virtually every purchase you make in 2022. This will add up significantly over time.

You should demand a raise at MINIMUM equal to inflation, but realistically should receive one ABOVE inflation. Anything  BELOW inflation is a pay cut.

If you receive a raise below inflation start looking for a new job. I know this isn't an easy thing to do but the sooner you start the better.

A raise less than inflation is a pay cut, a raise equal to inflation is the same pay, a raise above inflation is an actual raise. 

In the US we are currently on pace for 5-6%+ inflation during 2021.

Demand raises above inflation.


Edit: Credit to u/cubixy2k who down below commented that the best way to get a raise is to switch jobs. I couldn't agree more. As I said above I know it's not an easy thing to do but could be entirely worthwhile.
