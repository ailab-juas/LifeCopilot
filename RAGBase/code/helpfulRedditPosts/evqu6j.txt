LPT:Just a reminder during tax season that making more money does not "bump you up" a tax bracket.

content:
The US income tax system is progressive; meaning that the first $X gross you make gets taxed at the first X%.  If you made more than that, it gets taxed at the next rate until the next dollar cap, and then the next and so forth. 

Don't deny yourself the opportunity to increase your income because you are afraid that ALL of it will be taxed at a higher rate - It wont. 

Do be aware that you may lose certain welfare opportunities if you make more money though. One foot out of poverty can, in some cases, end up costing you more.
