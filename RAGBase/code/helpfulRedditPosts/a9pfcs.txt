LPT: if you're a government employee impacted by the shutdown, call your financial institution to see if they can help

content:
I'm no longer affiliated with any government agency, but during previous government shutdowns that impacted me and my family, many of the banks that concentrate on serving government employees and military members were very generous when we weren't sure when our next paycheck was coming.  I know for sure that USAA just straight up continued depositing members' pay like nothing was happening and I heard of several other banks and credit unions giving 0% loans to people impacted by the shutdown.

If you're currently impacted by the shutdown, I just want to say thank you, and even if your story isn't being told, there are lots of us out here who's hearts are breaking for you.  You are appreciated.  I'm sorry you're being let down again.
