title:
LPT: don’t fuck around and play games when you’re dating. Be honest and respectful, and even if you get hurt, you keep your integrity.

content:
Mind games, white lies, not replying to messages etc. if you’re serious about someone, they deserve your honesty. 
Don’t reject someone because it makes you feel desirable, don’t expect people to keep trying when you break their hearts. Don’t be reckless with peoples feelings. 

You might get called clingy, desperate or whatnot, but in the long run, you’ll find your happiness way before any of the bullies.
