LPT: Muting annoying tabs on Google Chrome.

content:
You already know that Google Chrome browser shows that tabs are making noise (represented by the speaker on the right of the tab). But there is a hidden option in Chrome to make this speaker do more than just show the tab makes noise. This function makes the icon becomes a button, and clicking on it you can mute the tab.

To enable this feature go to *chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting* and click **Enable**. 

Have a nice day :)
