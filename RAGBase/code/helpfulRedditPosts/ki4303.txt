LPT: When buying baby clothes for a gift, don’t buy “cute” clothes.

content:
Don’t buy the cute outfits with button-down shirts and bow ties, or the frilly overalls with a million straps and buttons. Avoid the adorable little tiny jeans for babies that have actual buttons and zippers and are made of stiff denim. Chances are, they won’t wear them if they’re too complicated to put on and take off.

Instead, buy the mix-and-match onesie sets with short and long sleeved onesies and matching sweatpants, footie pajamas with zippers (bonus points if the zipper starts by the foot or is a 2-way zipper), and sweatshirts (ones without hoods are even better because they’re safer for naps). Dark/bright colors are better than white/light colors because they hide stains.

Parents want simple clothes that are easy to get on and off and they don’t have to worry about staining.
