In December 2016, a huge list of email address and password pairs appeared in a "combo list" referred to as "Anti Public". The list contained 458 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was broadly circulated and used for "credential stuffing", that is attackers employ it in an attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password. 

The information was just recently released and I was one of the victims, so I thought I would share with everyone. Stay safe online everyone. Change your passwords often!

edit: A lot of people are saying they have 2 factor authentication so they are safe. This may not be the case if you have used this specific email/password combo on other sites. Yes, you may be protected from having your gmail account accessed but if you used a breached password on reddit for example (which doesn't use 2 factor authentication for normal users) then an attacker can still access your account.
