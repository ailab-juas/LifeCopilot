LPT: Your mental health is just as, if not more than, important as your physical health. Do not be ashamed or afraid to speak to someone if you’re struggling or in need of help.

content:
We all deal with some sort of mental health issue in our lives - whether long or short term. There should be no shame in seeking help for your mental wellbeing. Please have the courage to talk to a professional if you need help.

ETA: thank you kind internet strangers for the awards, but if you’ve got a few extra bucks please donate it to mental health services in your area!
