LPT: When dropping off a friend, always stick around until they've gotten inside.

content:
Do not drive away.

Especially if you live in a cold climate, you should always make sure your friend makes it inside. Where I'm from we've had several young people freeze to death outside or suffer extensive injury, especially after drinking.

I always make sure my friends get inside before I leave, especially the women. 

Edit: I say women specifically because, unfortunately, there are a lot of creeps out there.
