[LPT] Use your wrong hand for menial tasks like brushing teeth, showering, etc.

content:
I recently separated my right shoulder (I'm right handed) and have had to do everything left handed. It's really improved my ability to use my left hand which was almost useless before. Since then I've continued to do a lot of the small things in life with my left hand to continue to strengthen it. The benefits to being capable with both hands are obvious.
