YSK that Greyhound will help runaways between 12- 21 years old, with a ticket to return home.

content:
Greyhound works with the National Runaway Safeline to make sure runaway kids have a ticket home to get back to their families or legal guardians. To be eligible for a Greyhound ticket home, the child has to call the NRS helpline, be between 12 and 21 years old, be named on a runaway report and be willing to be reunited with their family (and vice versa). We also provide a free ticket for the parent or legal guardian if the young person is under the age of 15.
