YSK: If one or both of your parents is/was addicted to drugs or alcohol, it’s very likely that you will struggle with codependent traits and it is possible to work on these “Adult Child of an Addict/ Alcoholic” or “ACA Traits” through psychotherapy and support groups.

Why YSK:
I work as a mental health professional and I don't think ACA traits are discussed
nearly enough in our society and the vast majority of people newly coming to
treatment who are in the position of an ACA have never heard the term before and
aren't aware of the literature and support groups available to help. ACA traits
generally include difficulty creating and maintaining healthy boundaries with other
people, difficulty discerning and communicating one's own emotions, and a
tendency toward focusing on and prioritizing the needs and wants of others
above one's own.

"Adult Children of Alcoholics" by Janet Geringer Woititz is probably the seminal
book on the subject and largely applicable to adult children of addicts as well.

Although I understand many people are not interested in 12 Step-based support
groups, for those that are there are many free meetings available both in-person
and virtual for ACAs

EDIT 2: Maybe I could have been clearer, but to reiterate - ACA traits refer to the tendency of children of addicts to struggle with CODEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS, NOT addiction or substance abuse themselves, although this too is a risk. This phenomenon does not refer to a genetic condition but a learned set of behaviors and beliefs that arises from being raised by one or more addicts.
