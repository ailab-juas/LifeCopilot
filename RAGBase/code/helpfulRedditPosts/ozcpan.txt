YSK: Despite popular belief, most self-defense instructors say you should NOT use your keys as a weapon.

content:
First and foremost, you risk dropping your keys or having them taken from you, which means you have now lost access to your vehicle and/or home. Worse, if your attacker gets them now THEY have access. Getting inside your home or vehicle can be imperative to escaping, and you don't want to lose your access.

Secondly, the Wolverine key-hold is ineffective and is more likely to hurt you as nothing is actually holding the keys from shifting laterally in between your fingers. If you really have no other option it is better to hold your longest key like it's a knife coming down out of the bottom of your fist for a stabbing motion.

Third, keys are not sharp and are not nearly as effective as a weapon as you think. The most common thing people say is to poke your attacker in the eye, but just how dexterous are you? Can you actually poke a 2.5 inch long key into the 2 square inch eyeball of someone who is attacking you? Probably not. **Your thumbs are infinitely more effective at gouging eyeballs.**

Fourth, holding your keys in your hand means that your hand is now dedicated to holding keys. If you keep both hands free you can use either hand at any time to gouge an eye, hammer on the nose, grab an arm, jab the throat, stop a knife, squeeze or strike the groin, grab a nearby object to use as a weapon, etc.

**WHY YSK:** There is a lot of self-defense information out there, but listening to the wrong information can give you a false confidence in a method that may fail you when you need it. Knowing what works and what doesn't in actual situations can be the difference between life and death.
