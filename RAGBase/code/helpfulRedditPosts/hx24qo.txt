YSK: When the PS5 and XBOX Series X are available, you shouldn't be so quick to buy one.

content:
When the PS4 dropped a couple years ago, it came with so many problems and many had to be returned. Same goes for the XBOX One. Also for Nintendo when they launched the Switch.

It's best to atleast wait 2-3 weeks or even a month before buying either a PS5 or XBOX just to make sure you aren't a victim of launch failure.

Edit: Since this post is blowing up I'll update with some links to show my reasoning behind this post.
