LPT If you struggle with motivation try looking into 'locus of control'.

content:
There's no guarantee that it's the key to your specific psyche, but it's made such a massive difference in my life.

Basically, the locus of control is the degree to which you believe you are able to influence any given outcome in your life.  
If you, like me, always look for excuses/reasons not to do something, you're effectively relinquishing control and responsibility to get out of what you're doing. And furthermore, if you never take time to appreciate the things you do get done, this is an external locus of control, and it isn't conducive to motivation.  
Instead try reminding yourself, however small your accomplishments might be, that they got done because you decided to do them. Alternatively, if there's something you don't want to do, instead of relying on excuses, take responsibility for your choice to, for example, stay home and take care of yourself for the day, that is an internal locus of control, and with it comes motivation pretty naturally.

For the record, this isn't a tip that'll get you to stick to something 100% of the time overnight, but a simple shift in perspective from "I can't go to the gym because my leg hurts" to "I'm choosing to stay home to take care of my leg" makes it so much easier to get going next time, because if an excuse works once, it can work a million times, but a choice is always yours to change.
