LPT: Listen to a youtube playlist with VLC

I use this feature when I'm going to take a while fix something and need music to focus, but don't want my web browser open, because it crashes sometimes when browsing youtube. I's very convenient to just have a link to the playlist right there in my win7 startbar, two clicks away.
