LPT: Preplan for your death

content:
I sell burial plots, cremation services, and more for a cemetery. Weekly I see people walk in during the hardest days of their lives and try to make decisions on how their loved ones will be celebrated and remembered. They are crying, can't make logical decisions, and struggle financially. We see multiple burials a week that were preplanned, and their families don't have to do anything but show up and grieve. 

I know planning your death seems morbid, but it is the greatest gift you can give your loved ones. Pick your location and plot, pick your vault, pick your memorial, and make arrangements with a funeral home. Prepaying can be in monthly installments rather than one lumps charge that your family has to cover before you're buried. Many locations have no interest payment plans that can be spread out over years. Inflation means that prices will double just about every ten years, so you will save your family money. Plots are an asset, so they can be sold if not used, and usually for a profit depending on how long you hold on to it.

Try and get past the thought of you dying, and preplan for your passing. It is the last, and one of the biggest, gifts you can give to your loved ones.
