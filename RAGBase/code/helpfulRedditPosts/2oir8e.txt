LPT: When you throw up plug your nose to avoid all the acid from getting in there, Makes puking a lot less miserable.

I'm amazed at how many people don't know about this. And with it being flu season most places I hope this helps some people out.

EDIT:
 
For those confused on what plugging your nose is, just pinch it. 
 
A couple more LPT'S from the comments I liked.

- Eat some tums before you hurl.

- Sitting upright with a bucket has a similar effect as pinching your nose.

- If you get drunk enough, you won't even care there is puke in your nose.
