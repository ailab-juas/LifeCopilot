title:
[LPT] When you're feeling down, talk to yourself the way you would talk to a sad friend.

content:
It is easy to hate yourself when things are going bad, and it is commonly accepted that that's the normal thing to do. It doesn't have to be. You can work with *you* to make the situation better.

EDIT: Jesus almighty! I meant that with inner speech in mind, not to talk to yourself out loud.
