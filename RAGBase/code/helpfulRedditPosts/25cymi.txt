YSK that you don't need to keep stuffing crap in those cardboard flat-rate envelopes â€” The USPS will give you nice cushy spacious bubble-padded flat-rate envelopes for free.

I'm as guilty as anyone of trying to cram a shirt or pair of shoes or whatever into a cardboard flat-rate envelope to get that dank-ass flat-rate shipping, and ending up with something that [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/5vwwY79.jpg).

Getting to that point usually involves a lot of tape and swearing.

Turns out the USPS has flat-rate bubble envelopes. I've never been able to get them at the post office itself, but I order them online for free and they usually show up in 2-ish days. Costs $5.70 to ship Priority if you print the label online, which is $.65 more than the regular cardboard flat-rate envelopes, but I think well-worth the lower stress.
