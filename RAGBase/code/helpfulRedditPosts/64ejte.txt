title:
LPT: when you adopt a puppy or kitten, get them used to being handled and touched all over without freaking out.

content:
You never know when you'll need to stick your fingers in their mouth to stop them from choking on something, or to give them medication. You may even need to give them an injection, treat an ear infection, or pull a splinter from their toe pad. All of this is easier, and you're much less likely to be bitten, if they're very accustomed to letting you handle them. We started from day one with our kitten, and now he's so chill about it, he lets me brush his teeth every night.
