YSK that in the US, if you find a lost wallet, you can drop it in any USPS mailbox and they will mail it for free to to the address on the license.

YSK also know that even though the textbox says optional, an automod will remove your post if you don't put something in the text box.

Edit: I stand corrected. Apparently you still have to pay postage if it makes it to your house.
