YSK that woollen and ‘thermal’ clothing will stay warm even when they get wet, unlike other types of cloth. Just remember to wash them on gentle, cold water settings and hang to dry, as heat shrinks wool and melts some thermal cloth.

With the extra cold weather, it’s concerning to see fluffy, ‘warm’ looking clothing sold in stores that are made of synthetic materials that aren’t ‘thermal’ material, or indeed, wool.    Synthetic sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, socks, leggings or cotton jeans aren’t going to protect you outdoors if they get wet from snow, slush or rain.   

You can get lightweight merino wool for fashion clothing or to go next to your skin.   Consider buying lightweight wool slacks or merino/cheap thermal leggings to go under your jeans to wear for winter, especially when clearing snow.   

If you’re having trouble finding real winter clothing, try a hiking, outdoors or ski wear shop.   Most stock fashion items in wool/thermal material as well as practical hiking/ski gear.   You can get leggings you can wear out as fashion items that will keep you warm in the wet.   Spring is the best time for sales.
