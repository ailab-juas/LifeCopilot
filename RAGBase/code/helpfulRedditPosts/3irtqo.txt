LPT: Let the future you, make the decisions for you

content:
Most of us are striving to be better. We want to be healthier, more in shape, better looking, smarter, etc.

One of the things I have done, and I am constantly training my brain to do this, is I let the future me make my decisions for me. That way, the decisions I make represent who I want to be, and not who I am now. It is this method of thinking that has made it possible for me to turn my life around in many ways and start becoming the person I want to be. 

When I feel like smoking a cigarette,  I think to myself, do I want to be a smoker in the future?

When I want to eat something unhealthy, I think - would the future me eat this? 

When I don't want to go to the gym after a long day of work, I think to myself - Is the future me an out of shape slob, or is the future me I envision in my head sexy and in prime shape?

Because the future me in my mind, is a better version than the present me, this way of thinking has helped me tremendously in improving myself and making huge steps to becoming the person I want to be.
