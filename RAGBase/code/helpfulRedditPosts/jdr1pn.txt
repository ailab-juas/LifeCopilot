LPT: Hobbies are the spice of life! Try as many as you can, and NEVER be ashamed to give up activities that you no longer enjoy to make room for new ones.

content:
Bonus: You will meet many different people and experience novel things you've never seen/done before, which makes your life actually feel longer.

Don't ever be too cool to say yes to an invitation tabletop war gaming, or a day out birdwatching, or a cheesemaking class. Try your partner's/sibling's/friend's hobbies with them, even if you think you won't enjoy it. And you're absolutely NOT a quitter for giving stuff up - that's some childhood bullshit because your mom wanted to get more value out of the guitar she bought you. Go forth and experience it all!

If you're interested, my hobbies include singing, piano, drawing, painting, crochet, carpentry, woodwork and woodturning, ballroom and latin dancing, calligraphy, polymer clay, resin, beachcombing, houseplants, gardening, camping, boating, fishing, cooking, surfing, wakeboarding, cleaning, furniture restoration, organising, DIY and home renos, dog training, reading, video and computer games, paddleboarding, board games, poetry, snorkelling, baking, pressing flowers, doing puzzles, quad biking and there'll be more I'm forgetting. MANY of these are free.

Open invitation to share your past/present/future hobbies in the comments! ðŸ˜Š
