LPT: When renting housing, buy yourself a new shower head.

content:
I lived in a crappy, hundred year old apartment with shitty water pressure for years before a roommate came in and bought us a new shower head. It solved the water pressure problem and made the shower feel so damn luxurious. Iâ€™ve done it all my new places now, it makes a world of difference!
