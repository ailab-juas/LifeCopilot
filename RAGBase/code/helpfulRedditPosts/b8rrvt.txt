LPT Mamma animals often leave their babies for short periods to go and find food so don't immediately bring in a lonely baby animal.

It's spring so it's baby season.  Most mamma animals find a spot they feel is safe and leave their babies while they get food, sometimes it's for hours.  Leave wild baby animals be, they are tougher than they look.

Exceptions obviously apply.  If the babies are in danger, show signs of infection or injury, do try and get them help.  If they are in danger, see if you can move them to a safer spot (take a look online to get specific tips for that animal) before getting a rehabilitation center involved.
