LPT: Even if you have no intentions of canceling a subscription, make an attempt to cancel it. You could save a lot of money in the long run.

Figured this out a while ago and I honestly haven’t paid full price for most subscriptions for a while now.

Most people subscribe and just stick to it for years. For the most part, when you attempt to cancel, they’ll ask you for a reason. Choose “too expensive “. Most companies will then give you really good deals, some even as much  as half what you should normally be paying. 

Just did one this morning with a VPN I’ve been using and got the next 6 months for free. 

P.S English isn’t my first language so apologies for any grammatical errors.
