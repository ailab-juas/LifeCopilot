LPT: If you want a cat to like you, when it makes eye contact with you, give it a slow "blink" in both your eyes, it makes them know you are not a threat and want to be friends.

Started volunteering at a cat shelter, and someone told me this, it's SHOCKING how well it works, hissing cat will be hissing at you, you do a slow blink back at them, and they just stop, and a bunch will let you pet them that have not let you do it before that were afraid of you. 

I started noticing my cats at home do it 100% of the time and now I do it back to them and they come right over for snuggles when I give them the slow blink.
