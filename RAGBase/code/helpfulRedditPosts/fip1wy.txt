YSK that store employees are going through a stressful time right now, and we should all treat them with kindness and patience.

Yesterday I was at Walmart and saw how depleted the store was. No toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, bottled water, and most canned goods and breads were gone too. The items that were left on the shelves were very disorganized, and I felt bad that for the employees because they have will have to clean up the mess that panicked shoppers left.

 After going through the self checkout line, an employee came up and wiped down the area. I asked her what was the craziest thing that she experienced at work lately. She vented for several minutes about how rude customers have been, how they demand to know when they will have more toilet paper, how big the shipment will be, and if they plan to order more. She told me that she couldn't give them an answer and said that she even saw a guy try to fight someone else for the items in their cart. I asked her if anyone has quit and she said not yet. 

Please be kind and respectful to store employees. It's not their fault that they are sold out of things.

Edit: I'm not saying that employees don't deserve to be treated with respect and kindness under normal circumstances. I thought that would be assumed without saying, but here I am editing my post.
