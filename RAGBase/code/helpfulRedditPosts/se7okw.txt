LPT: if you ever find yourself homeless and desperate for food, search the trash cans of fast food restaurants for receipts. Often times, there are surveys on them that will give you free food and people just throw it away

So for starters, it should go without saying that you want to be at least *somewhat* discreet about it and not just go rummaging through every trash can you see. The outdoor trash cans where employees can’t see you are ideal, but often times in the indoor trash cans there are crumpled up receipts you can pick up right off the top. The fast food places I’ve been to so far that participate in these surveys have been Taco Bell, Wendy’s, McDonald’s, and Chick-Fil-A. (Feel free to add any more chains you know of in the comments) 

Lots of people going to fast food restaurants just want to get their food and leave and don’t care about their receipts, so they just throw them in the garbage. At the bottom of a lot of receipts are links to surveys you can take that will reward you with a free sandwich, burrito, or something similar. A buddy of mine was on the streets for a while and rotated between restaurants in his area doing this and actually ate pretty good for a while before management caught on. 

If you can get the employees to like you and get them to sympathize with your situation, sometimes they’ll even throw in a little something extra just to help out. 

It ain’t much, but it’s better than starving!
