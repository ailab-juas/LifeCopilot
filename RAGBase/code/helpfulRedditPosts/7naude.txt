YSK: If you are looking to purchase a gym membership and have health insurance, you can often get reimbursed for your membership, get discounted rates, or sometimes even a free membership from your health insurance.

With gym membership enrollment on the rise this time, many gyms offer low rates or deals such as no enrollment fees to entice new members. Many of these low rates or deals, however, are often only temporary. If you have health insurance, chances are you can secure a better deal through your provider.  This makes sense because a healthier member is less likely to suffer from costly illnesses like heart disease or diabetes, so offering gym membership deals saves them money. These better deals can range from a reimbursement per month as long as you can prove you went to the gym X amount of times, to reduced rates at certain gyms, or just outright free memberships. The easiest way to find out is to do a quick internet search of you healthcare providers name and gym membership. I.E. "InsuranceCompanyName gym membership". With larger gym chains, you can also ask if they offer special rates for members who have your particular health insurance provider. 

Two providers that i know from personal experience that offer gym membership deals are UnitedHealthCare and Highmark.

United will reimburse members $20 a month if they visit a gym 12 times or more in a month.

Highmark offers some members (depends of which tier of insurance you have from them) enrollment into a multi-gym membership for a low rate of only $25 a month. I personally am enrolled in this program and have access to literally thousands of gyms and physical therapy centers for the cost of just $25/m. I personally have memberships to Planet fitness, La fitness, anytime fitness, snap fitness, and my local ymca, all of which is included in my cost.

TL;DR: If you are looking to get a gym membership, check to see if your health insurance provider offers you any deals for gym memberships.

Edit: If your provider offers anything similar that you are aware of, post them up to help others be aware.

Edit #2: Even if you can not find an info online from a quick internet search, call your providers Customer Service line and inquire directly about any fitness membership offers or reimbursement programs they may offer. While it may not be directly advertised out in the open, remember that healthy member saves them money, so it is still possible to receive some compensation for a gym membership.

Edit #3: Thanks to the kind stranger who gave me gold. Just want to help people who are trying to better themselves save some money!
