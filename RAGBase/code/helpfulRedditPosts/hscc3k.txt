YSK experiencing a clinical mental health problem at some point in life may actually be the norm, rather than the exception.

The problem with many studies on mental health is that they don’t follow people over time. So when they tell you something will affect 1 in 4, that statistic might seriously understate reality. In the early 70s, a research team from Duke University started following 1,037 babies, collecting a large amount of health and psychological data at multiple points between the ages 11-38.   


What they found was that 82.7% of subjects met the clinical criteria for mental disorder at least once between late childhood and midlife, and only 17.3% never actually developed clinical symptoms.I think this is important because it shows us that what looks like a rare disease may, in fact, be a social epidemic — or, rather, human experience.
