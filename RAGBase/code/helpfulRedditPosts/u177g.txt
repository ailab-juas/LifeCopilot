LPT: Never tell anyone that you have a job interview.

content:
While it's a great accomplishment that you got an interview in such a bad economy, you are in no way guaranteed a job.  Trust me...having to explain to Grandma and Grandpa why you weren't good enough for the employer is not fun.  Having to explain it to every Facebook friend is a nightmare.

Just be patient, and when you do get a job, you'll look like a genius when everyone thinks it was on your first try.
