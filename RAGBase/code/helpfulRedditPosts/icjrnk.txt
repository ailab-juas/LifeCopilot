title:
YSK that it’s okay to cut toxic parents out of your life.

content:
I won’t hit you all with a long essay. But essentially, a few weeks ago I cut my cocaine-addicted father out of my life. His addiction has caused me 15+ years of psychological and emotional trauma, and as a 26 year old adult I decided that enough was enough. I no longer wanted that in my life, my SO’s life or my future kid(s?) lives. At which point, I told my Dad to get clean or we would not have a relationship, ever. 

Since then, I have found that my overall mental health, motivation and outlook on life have changed. Of course, it’s something I still need to adjust to but it really has felt like a weight was lifted. With all that said, if your parents are a legitimately negative part of your life it’s okay to cut them out. Doing this does not mean you don’t love them, but that you love yourself as well.
