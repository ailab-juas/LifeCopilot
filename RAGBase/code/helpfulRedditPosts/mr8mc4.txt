LPT: To all dog owners: If you comb out your dog's winter coat just leave it outside, don't throw it away. Some birds that build their nests now will be super happy to use the fur to make the nest extra fluffy and cozy.

Edit: Some of you complained for good reasons:

Don't leave the fur flying around in public areas where it might disturb others. Do it in your own garden.
Genious idea I learned today: Stuff the fur into a fence or bird feeder. The hairs won't fly to your neighbour and the birds can pull them out if they want to.

Also: Thank you for all the awards! I never thought this would blow up like this...
