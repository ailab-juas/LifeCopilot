LPT: If an alkaline battery leaks and ruins the device it was in, don't contact who made the device. Contact who made the batteries.

content:
Just about every well-known battery manufacturer has a “device-damage-by-battery-leakage” policy under which you may be eligible to have your device repaired or replaced if it has been damaged by leakage of alkaline batteries which came from that manufacturer.

A kind of expensive flashlight of mine stopped working, and I couldn't get the batteries out because of the leak. I contacted the manufacturer to see if my warranty covered it. It doesn't, but they told me about this.

Long story short: I'm waiting for my repaired flashlight to arrive in the mail.
