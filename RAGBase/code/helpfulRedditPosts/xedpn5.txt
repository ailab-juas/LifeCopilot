LPT: Not feeling like doing the dishes after cooking and eating? Just rinse them for now. It will make the cleanup easier and future self will be thankful.

Pretty underwhelming maybe. But I struggled to keep my kitchen clean during a lot of my feeling-blue-phases and they piled up really quickly. Having to soak them all the day I finally wanna do them sucks and takes even more time.

I found that rinsing them under hot water after Im done eating speeds things up significantly. They're almost clean after, so you won't have to put in a lot of work the day after or whenever you feel up to the task.

Bonus points if you start doing that while cooking, everything you don't need anymore gets a quick rinse. Cutlery and similiar utensils can be left to dry right away most the time.
