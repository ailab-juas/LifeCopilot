YSK: You can get spent grains from your local craft brewery to make really amazing bread, pretezels, dog treats, etc.

content:
Some breweries use the spent grains themselves, or sell them to farmers as feed, but many just compost them or throw them out. Call ahead and ask the brewer if they have grains available. A few of my local breweries give them away for free.
