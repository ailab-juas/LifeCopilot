LPT: If someone experiences a near drowning, get them to an ER, and monitor them for 24 hours.

content:
This weekend, I was with my family at a pool, and my 7 year old Son wandered too deep.  I had established a routine with my wife to constantly check on the kids.  It worked, and I noticed within a minute or so.  He was slipping under water, and not coming all the way up.  We got him out of the pool, but by that time he had turned blue.  He coughed up some water.  I was advised to take him to the Emergency Room.  Apparently, near drowning victims can sustain lung damage that does not manifest right away.  When I got to ER, they confirmed this.  They checked him over, and kept him for several hours, and sent us home with instructions to watch him for 24 hours.  He is doing okay.

TLDR; If someone almost drowns, take them to ER, even if they seem OK, My son is OK.

Edit:  Some people are getting the impression that I left my kid unattended to "sink or swim" at a pool. I was outside with him.  There were several other adults as well, both in and out of the pool.
