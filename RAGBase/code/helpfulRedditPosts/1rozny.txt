LPT: When you are staying at a hotel in a country where you do not speak the language or not know your way around, carry with you the business card of the hotel.

content:
Most hotels will have at their front desk a card with their details on it. Leave it in your wallet and if you need to get into a taxi but cannot speak the language well or know the area, you can show them the card. This will save you time and reduce likelihood of miscommunication. 

Also, some hotels will have a notepad in the rooms with their details on it, take that instead of the hotel card if you cannot get one.
