LPT: If you live in an area prone to power cuts in bad weather, fill your freezer with soda bottles full of water.

content:
The bottles will stay cool for ages and help stop your freezer warming up while the power is out,  you can transfer a couple to the fridge too if you need to.

In summer you can use them in your cool box to keep your food cold without the issues of melty ice or paying for cool boxes.
