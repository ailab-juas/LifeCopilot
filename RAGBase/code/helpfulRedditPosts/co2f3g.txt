title:
YSK - X percent of Y is equal to Y percent of X. So, if you want to find out what 7% of 50 is, you could instead find out what 50% of 7 is, which is 3.5. This means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5.

More examples: If you want to find out what
2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll
get 0.4. So, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4.

Or, 12% of 25 can be alternatively written
out as 25% of 12 instead, which would be 3.

Explanation: Commutative Property. So,
0.07 times 50 will always equal 50 times
0.07

I hope you found this interesting and/or
