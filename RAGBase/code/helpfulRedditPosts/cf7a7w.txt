title:
YSK of "Be My Eyes", an app that allows sighted volunteers to assist visually impaired people

content:
The feeling of being able to help another person navigate their everyday life despite visual impairments is truly like no other. I installed this app after reading an article about it back in January, and so far was able to help a blind man adjust his thermostat, another to find out the expiration date of some food in his fridge, helped a woman color co-ordinate an outfit, and so on. This is an amazing initiative, and all it takes is a mobile phone with internet connection and a working microphone. The calls are few and far between, and could happen at any moment - but I don't need to worry if I can't immediately respond, as there are thousands of volunteers and someone is bound to pick the call.
