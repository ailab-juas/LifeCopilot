LPT: Free Alternatives to a Humidifier

content:
For young adults just starting out in the world who don’t want yet another appliance that demands money, electricity, cleaning/maintenance, living space in operation and storage space when not, that is another albatross when you move and will likely wind up in a landfill in a few years, I give you the following solutions:

A fine mist spray bottle: When it’s dry and you want to change that quickly spray this on plants, rugs, curtains, hanging bath towels and anywhere there’s a safe surface to dampen. Much of the spray volume will evaporate before it hits a surface.

Bowls of water: Multiple bowls of water will evaporate throughout the day. Put them in front of vents or on radiators, toaster/pizza ovens, on bookshelves, tables and near plants. Refill them every couple of days.

Before drying your laundry, pick out a few heavy items like jeans and towels and let them hang dry in your place.

Plug the drain before pouring out that boiling pasta water and let it sit and evaporate in your sink and on dirty dishes. You’ll also have the benefit of the heat disbursement.

After a bath let the water sit a hour or two before draining the tub.
