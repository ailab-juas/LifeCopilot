YSK: Always have a mechanic YOU trust inspect a used car before buying, even if buying a "fully certified" car from a dealer. A professional inspection will provide an important extra level of insurance that you're not buying a pack of trouble.

content:
Why YSK: Problems that can be spotted by a complete professional inspection, which includes putting the car up on a lift, include: frame damage, damage to wires or insulation caused by animals, poor previous repair work, flood or fire damage, hidden rust, fluid leaks, burned-out bulbs, nonfunctioning accessories, suspicious odours and overdue maintenance procedures.
