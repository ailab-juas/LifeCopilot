LPT: If you ever see someone not knowing how to do something basic, don't ask them how they didn't know that because it's something their parents should have teached them. Not all people had the luck to be born with good parents.

content:
If you ask them that it is as if you are blaming them for having incompetent parents. That applies for other things that people should normally learn during childhood. You don't know what kind of childhood they had. Some people were bullied a lot and may lack some social skills. Some people were born in a country with not a very good school system. Others had to do other work besides school, so maybe they didn't have as much time to study.

If the person is trying to improve in their adult life it is all that matters. People should not be made to fell guilty or ashamed for whatever happened in their childhood, even if they could take action to a degree. When we are so young we don't make the best decisions.
