The government has endorsed the move, and asked the UN to update its database. 

"Czechia" is to be used as "Slovakia" is to "The Slovak Republic" and "Russia" is for the "Russian Federation". 

Why should you know? Because it'll become the new common name for the nation, so expect to see it in many places and don't be confused!
