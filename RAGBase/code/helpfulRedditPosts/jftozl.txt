YSK that reaching out to a depressed friend instead of waiting for them to contact you will make their day

Why YSK: Being in a mentally dark place is awful. Sometimes it can feel like you are unwanted and people don’t want to talk to you. But when someone talks to you and wants to know how you’re feeling, it is so helpful.

Edit: Thank you all for upvoting this so that more people can see it. I hope that this will help someone out there and maybe save a life.
