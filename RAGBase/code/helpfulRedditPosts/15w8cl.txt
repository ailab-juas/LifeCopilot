LPT: When you need to ask a favor of someone, ask it upfront THEN make small talk

content:
Making small talk before you ask for the favor makes it seem like the only reason you wanted to talk was to "butter them up" so they'll grant the favor. 

Plus, if you're looking for an 'in' to ask for something you won't be able to focus as well on the conversation, and they won't be able to focus as well if they're trying to figure out what you want the whole time.
