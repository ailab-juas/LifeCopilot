I’ve been trying to run and work out more and as a avid outdoorsman. I’ve realized that if you learn to breath it makes everything easier. 

For example your muscles do not work well without oxygen so controlled breathing while working out is highly important.

As well as just general life advice it helps you calm down in stressful situations and think clearly.
