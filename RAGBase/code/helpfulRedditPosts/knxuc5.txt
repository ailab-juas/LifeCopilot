LPT: if you suspect you caught covid or your only other live-in partner gets symptoms before you, meal-prep and prepare. Get groceries (delivered if you can), make a giant pot of soup to last the week etc. don't wait until you're bed ridden because it will be hell

content:
We have a bubble with one other couple and She's had symptoms since Sunday. Her bf didn't make any preparations before he started showing symptoms last night (4 days later) and now they're both stuck in bed with no energy to prepare anything that would be good for their health.

My partner started showing symptoms late last night as well so I've made enough food and got enough groceries that we won't have to prepare too much and I feel this was the right thing to do.

Good luck out there ✌️


ETA: I'm getting a lot of responses who are misunderstanding my tip so I'm gonna try to clear this up.
I'm suggesting getting groceries delivered to your door so that you don't go out and infect anyone, if you don't have this option please opt for curbside pickup and avoid going in to stores or anywhere you could infect people. And I'm suggesting doing it before you show symptoms because there is a very real possibility that once you start to exhibit symptoms then you will be stuck in bed or too exhausted to do anything. 

My friend had ample time to make any kind of preparations like food delivery or meal prep and he chose to do nothing and now wishes he also had done something, so I'm providing you his cautionary tale so that you don't find yourselves in this position.

Edit 2: some commenters have added some great ideas for prep:
&gt;Preparing some soup and freezing it, or some spaghetti sauce or chilli, order lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that are easy to prepare and eat, get some stuff to help manage symptoms like cough drops perhaps! Frozen food you can put in the oven is quick and simple also. Thank you! U/advice-239400


&gt;The Voila pasta and veggie bags in the frozen veggie section are life savers!! Thanks! U/bleepin_bleep

&gt;For anybody who's curious Walmart has a pretty good deal with "walmart+" which is basically just delivery for food and such at like 10 bucks a month and you can start a free 30 day trial with answering 3-5 questions. Thank you! U/somewhiteguys

&gt;GrubHub and ubereats is always an option too guys if you have the means! Thanks u/supercharged0709

Thank you for everyone's input and suggestions! RIP my inbox there are way too many messages to get through so I'll save it for another day. Happy new year everyone! Happy and healthy wishes to you all, yes even the lot of you who were rude for no reason.

And thanks for the awards!
