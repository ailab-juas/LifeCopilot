LPT: Use a binder clip to help deflate pool rafts and other items that require pressure to open the valve.

content:
A few months ago, I was required to deflate and store several inflatable pool rafts for the winter.  The only way to allow for the air to escape was by "pinching" both sides of the valve and then placing pressure on the raft.

Halfway into the first raft, I decided to try and find a better way to complete the task.  I was able to find a binder clip and it sped up the processes considerably.
