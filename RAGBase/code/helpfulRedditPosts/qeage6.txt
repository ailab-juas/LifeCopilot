LPT: If you think you've seen a ghost, always open a window

content:
Not sure if this belongs in this sub, but someone gave me this tip and it blew my mind. 

Now first of all, I'm not a paranormal skeptic so don't come at me for giving this tip, just something that might safe a life.

Apparently a common side effect of carbon monoxide poisoning is hallucinations. So, it could be that, if you don't have a CO alarm, you might be experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning. That's why you should always open a window after a suspected paranormal sighting

Edit: yes, I know you should always buy a CO alarm, but most people don't think to run to the shops when they experience something paranormal and the alarm could be broken. It's just a quick tipüòÅ
