Why YSK: it's a pain having to remember to check and select the faster route.
Google maps is starting to default to displaying the route with the lightest emissions rather than the shortest travel time.
Apparently it's only when the ETA for both routes is similar, but nearly 10 minutes is significant for my morning commute.
