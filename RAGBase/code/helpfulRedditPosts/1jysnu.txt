YSK using a Q-tip to clean the inside of your ear can pack the wax in, eventually leading to the temporary deafening of that ear.

I know most of you know not to use Q-tips to clean inside your ear. I know a lot of people do it anyway. Personally, I always heard not to use them inside the ear, and never even thought about why we shouldn't do it, so I did it, and I went deaf in one ear. I assume I was simply using a Q-tip way too often, because I've used them all my life and never had this problem.

For the record, I had to use Hydrogen Peroxide to loosen the wax and removed it *carefully* using a loopy metal thing to break it up and get it out.
