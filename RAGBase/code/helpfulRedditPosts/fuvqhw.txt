LPT: The phrase is ‘I couldn’t care less’.

content:
Saying ‘I could care less’ is the exact opposite of what you’re trying to convey and is like nails on a chalkboard. See David Mitchell’s rant on the topic for proof.

Merriam Webster’s take on it is a great &amp; read thank you for the people who linked it https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/could-couldnt-care-less

And Weird Al can’t be overlooked https://youtu.be/8Gv0H-vPoDc

Any opportunity for sarcasm is always welcome and I’ll be rotating the more threatening “I could care less, do you want me to try” into my daily life. I’m sure it’ll be a hit in a lockdown household.

Thank you for the awards kind strangers.
