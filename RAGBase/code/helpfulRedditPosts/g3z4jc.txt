YSK that floor mats for your car (at least for the driver) are not something you should just buy cheap on Amazon from a random brand.

Aftermarket floor mats can and have caused deaths because they slip onto the pedals. The car manufacturer would probably be held liable if their mats caused accidents so they are very careful to have them fit and not slip around during driving. For aftermarket mats, you should not buy some no-name mats from a company you've never heard of who probably bought them for a couple of dollars on Alibaba. If you're going aftermarket, do some research on the brand to make sure they are reputable, and I don't just mean Amazon reviews I mean go look at their website, search online to see if they caused any accidents, etc...

Most authorized dealerships will refuse to put aftermarket mats back in a vehicle they work on and instead put them in the trunk so they can't be held liable if those mats cause an accident for this reason.
