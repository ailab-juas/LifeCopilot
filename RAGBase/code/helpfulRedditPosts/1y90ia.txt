LPT: Shrunk your favorite wool sweater in the wash? No worries! You can unshrink it.

content:
so I got a big stain on my favorite wool sweater. I knew it would have to be washed, but instead of googling the proper steps I thought, as long as I don't put it in the dryer it'll be fine. 

I was wrong. The spin cycle on the washing machine caused it to shrink. I was devastated. My favorite sweater was ruined. 

But, there was recourse!

Just follow these steps [borrowed from thebudgetfashionista.com]:

1. Stretch your wool sweater by soaking the garment in a tub of gentle hair conditioner and lukewarm water. 
2. Do not wring the sweater, but after draining the tub, press the sweater against the side of the basin to drain the excess water.  
3. Remove the garment and lay it flat on a very thick, very absorbent towel. 
4. Use another towel to blot away the excess water. 
5. Gently pull the sweater into the desired shape. 
6. Let the sweater air dry flat.

Voila! Good as new.
