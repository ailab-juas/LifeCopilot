title:
LPT: Do the hard part first.

content:
When you have a pile of stuff you don't wanna do, but you gotta do, just tackle the part you dread most first.

Shovel the shit, chop up the corpse, whatever it is, embrace the suck.

Get the hard part done straight away, and the rest is down hill.

If you start easy, dipping your toe in and working up to it, you'll dread the big bad part the whole way, and be more fatigued.
