LPT: Mute your phone when on hold to a call center, you are likely being recorded the entire time.

content:
Call centers often retain the entire audio log when you dial, so assume anything you say can be used against you should you get into a legal dispute. To save on headaches later, just mute your phone. Hoping this isn't a repost - if I'm regurgitating a previous LPT my bad.
