title:
LPT: In light of the recent Amazon and Mayfield Candle manslaughter, here is a very important thing to know, remember, and act on-- NO employer can hold you against your will. NO employer can force you to come into work in life-threatening circumstances.

content:
If your employer/management tells you you're "not allowed to leave" and your instinct is telling you it's not safe to stay-- LEAVE. They cannot physically hold you, that is tantamount to holding you hostage. The worst an employer can do is fire you, and almost *zero* jobs are worth your life. 

(And if they do fire you for refusing to put your life in danger then you can sue the ever-living daylights out of them-- but not if you're dead.)
