LPT: Christmas is NOT a mandatory expense. If you’re struggling financially this year your friends and family will understand if you don’t buy them anything. Just let them know well in advance.

We live in a society obsessed with consumerism and Christmas advertising is everywhere. This is just a reminder that Christmas is more than just gift giving. 

EDIT: On the flip-side, LPT: Don’t expect anything for Christmas. If everybody lowers their expectations Christmas would be a lot less stressful and more enjoyable. 

The tradition of extravagant gift-giving has gotten out of control. Focus on what’s important. Don’t let these corporations tell us what to do with money and drive us into debt. A nice photograph or personal e-card tells people you’re thinking of them and saves the planet from 25 million tons of garbage and 2.65 billion generic Christmas cards that is likely to end up in the trash in the US alone. Merry Christmas, Reddit.
