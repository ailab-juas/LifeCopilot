LPT: You can make banana ice cream with just bananas

content:
1. Slice and freeze bananas
2. Put sliced bananas in food processor or blender
3. It'll magically turn creamy like a banana ice cream
4. ~~Get naked~~ and enjoy ice cream

You can also put in flavors (like vanilla extract or coconut milk... I might try using cocoa or something).

I was craving ice cream but I've gotten pretty tubby recently. My friend told me about this and I was actually surprised at how it turned out. There are a ton of youtube videos with this.
