LPT: When sharing information from major media outlets like CNN, Huffington Post, Wallstreet Journal, check to make sure it's not one of their many "Blog" or "Opinion" editorials..

content:
I see it happen A LOT on reddit; Some anon will share something either supporting or disproving an argument. Problem is, the editorial they are using is legitimately an opinion piece or an excerpt from a blog post with a clear cut agenda. Its no problem using rhetoric similar to yours, but in many cases I see it being used as objective fact, rather than someone's interpretation who may or may not be qualified to speak on the subject.
