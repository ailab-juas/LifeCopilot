YSK: With the decrease in traffic there is much more wildlife on the edges of roadways so if you're travelling anywhere please be mindful..

I am considered an essential worker so I've seen the roads in my area(Long Island, NY) everyday for the past month. (I can only assume it's the same elsewhere) There are A LOT more animals getting closer to the road and I am asking you to please be extra cautious. I drove past a goose standing beside the body of another goose last week and it broke my heart. These wild animals are adjusting the same as we are - and they don't deserve to die due to carelessness.
