LPT: chase away wasps and bees by misting them with water

content:
Use a spray bottle filled with water and spray wasps and bees with it when they start to bug you. They will think its raining and quickly fly away. It works like a charm. Bonus: the first wasp that comes scouting for a food source has nothing interesting to report to the rest of the hive. Not only did you chase away one wasp, there won't be ten other ones following up.
