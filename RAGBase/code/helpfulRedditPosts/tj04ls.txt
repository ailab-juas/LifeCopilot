LPT: When you move to a new house with pets, always check for rat poison.

content:
This one is from experience, we just moved to a new home with our 2 cats. In the first week one of our furballs found rat poison that was placed by the previous owner. 
Luckily, our cat is fine because we saw her eat the poison  and were quick to respond. But she still needed medical treatment and we were worried sick for a few days. 
A quick scan of your house and/or garden can save your four-legged companion!
