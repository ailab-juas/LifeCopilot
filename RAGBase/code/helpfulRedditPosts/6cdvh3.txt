LPT: If you are looking for a whiteboard (for school, work, home) then buy shower boards at a home improvement store. They offer the same material for a ridiculously lower price.

If you are looking for a whiteboard of any size, then try going to Home Depot or Lowe's and ask around for shower boards. Chances are, you will find yourself a huge wooden "shower board" that looks exactly like a whiteboard. Ask them to cut it into a desirable piece (they usually do this for free). I ended up with three 2.5' by 4' sized pieces for around $12 which could have easily been $100. It works just like any other whiteboard. The link to one is [here](http://www.homedepot.com/p/EUCATILE-32-sq-ft-96-in-x-48-in-Hardboard-Thrifty-White-Tile-Board-HDDPTW48/205995949). Hope this helps for any office, home, or school that may need a whiteboard for cheap.

Edit: Dimensions of boards

Edit 2: Well, this blew up. Giving credit to my 8th grade math teacher for teaching me this tip.
