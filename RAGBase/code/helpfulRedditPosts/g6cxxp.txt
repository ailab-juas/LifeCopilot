LPT: Do not put your feet up on the dashboard when you sit in the passenger seat of a vehicle! If you are involved in a car crash the airbags can give you catastrophic injuries.

content:
Airbags deploy somewhere between 100-220 MPH. This can send your knees crashing into your face. You will not be able to get your feet down in time. A simple crash that everyone else in the car will walk away from could be devastating for you. Here is [an xray](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.autoblog.com/amp/2020/01/27/x-ray-injuries-feet-on-car-dashboard/) of a woman who was in a crash while riding like this. It ended her career. Drive safe!
