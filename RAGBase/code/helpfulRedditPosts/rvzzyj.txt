LPT: If you’re helping someone out who needs the help don’t film it or post what you did on social media.

content:
If I was someone who needed help and was already scared enough asking for help, the last thing I want is it to be posted all over social media in order for them to get validation. 

This should go without saying. Being vulnerable in a financial way is extremely shameful for lot’s of people because it’s aligned closely with people’s social standing.

Some people are going through a tough time and it’s important to know that it doesn’t happen forever and there are ways out of the hamster wheel.
