LPT: Know how to tell what your breath smells like

content:
That old blow-into-your-palm-and-smell-it trick doesn't work. Instead, make sure your hand is dry and clean. Optional to wash your hand in non-scented soap. Then proceed to simply lick the back of your hand. Wait a few seconds it to dry up and then smell it. The smell should give you an idea of what your breath smell like.
