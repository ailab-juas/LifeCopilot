title:
YSK that your attitude at work is often more important than the quality of your work

content:
Why YSK: A positive attitude at work results in you being more likely to be considered for promotion, for your faults to be overlooked and to have people defending your corner if the discussion of letting you go comes up.

Great workers with terrible attitudes are sacked all the time.

But businesses will always struggle to sack the person who always turns up with a smile, a positive can-do attitude, is open to change and is there to help people out or lift team spirits. 

These people are incredibly valuable to a business and are difficult to replace.
