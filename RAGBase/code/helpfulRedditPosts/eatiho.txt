LPT: Dont treat other people’s family dynamics like you treat your own, especially during the Christmas season

content:
If someone tells you they’re not speaking to a family member or parent, don’t shame them for it or pressure them to talk to them because they’re “family” and it’s the holidays. A lot of people have strained/terrible  relationships and  are triggered by the idea. And if they do feel the pressure and go see family, it could cause a lot of damage they may not be able to deal with.
