title:
YSK that if your pets spook you out by regularly staring/whining at some random spot on a wall, they may be hearing water move through the plumbing, and not “sensing ghosts”

content:
Why YSK: I’ve read multiple accounts of this on AskReddit threads (you know the kind), so I thought I’d mention it.

I’m not saying it’s *definitely not ghosts*, but I have been told this by at least three separate plumbers (I really don’t know why, other than the fact that I own pets and live somewhere with walls: I never bring it up). 

But I did check it out, and it is true, at least in my case.

And this info might help someone somewhere sleep easier tonight.
