LPT: Don’t apply more than a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to the brush. That’s all you need for a deep, efficient brush. The toothpaste companies are intentionally lying to you in their ads when they show enough paste to cover every bristle.

They want everyone to use more then they need per brush, so they go through the tube faster, so everyone buys more toothpaste.
