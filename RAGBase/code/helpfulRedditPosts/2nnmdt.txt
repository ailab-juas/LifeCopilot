LPT: Instead of saying 'yeah you told me' when someone repeats a story, say 'yes, I remember this.'

content:
It comes across as caring enough to remember, as opposed to being bored with the other person's story. 

Edit: This doesn't mean you should lie if you don't remember/care (which is half of the replies in my inbox). This obviously applies to people whom you actually give a shit about, not that guy at work who tells you the same thing seven times a week or whatever.
