LPT: there is no requirement you enjoy a holiday, anniversary, birthday on the actual day! Find the best day for it and celebrate under the best of conditions

Recently a buddy tested positive for Covid. As soon as he was positive, they sent their toddler to the grandparents. 

My buddy was super stressed that the kid would miss Christmas. He and his wife stuck to their guns: the kid would stay at the grandparents regardless, which meant the kid “missed” Christmas Day. Smart move, as a couple days ago his wife also tested Covid positive. 

My wife was a hospital nurse a few years. Her dad was on-call for IT his entire career. For years I was in an IT role that required off-hours work. We always had to work around holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. This is all to say we are just accustom to it, but others might stress over it.

My buddy knows his kid will be happy and he has less worry about kid getting Covid.

tl;dr - celebrate life’s events on the best possible day
