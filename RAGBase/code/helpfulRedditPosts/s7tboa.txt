LPT Before you move out of your home, take a video of yourself walking around the house.

Before we moved out of my childhood home, I took a video of my view as I walked up my driveway, opened my front door and walked around to each room of the house. 

This has been so helpful for me to not forget the little details, and is comforting when I miss it. The video captures the sounds, which are such a huge part of my memories.

The sounds of your screen door closing, the creaks in the stairs, the birds chirping in your backyard. The way light hits your living room on an afternoon, the background noise of a tv playing. 

I’d recommend you do this now, while your home is lived in and before any packing has begun. In my video there are boxes everywhere and furniture’s missing but watching it still helps me remember what it felt like and transports me back to an earlier time.

Just a suggestion, if you’re sentimental like me.

Edit: Thanks for the awards :) Glad to hear people found this before moving out. For those of you who didn’t have a good experience in your childhood home, I hope you have a happy place now that you can document for future you.
