LPT: Turn the sharpness of your TV down to 0. Anything above 0 sharpness is artificial sharpening added by your TV and ruins the image quality.

Final edit (everything else was erased): OOOOOOOOOOOkay. Many of you who are commenting feel that my post is either condescending, rude, or bossy. I'm not sure where that is coming from, because I posted this with the intention to help people improve their picture quality. Trust me, I will never post in lpt again after all of this bs.

In hindsight, I should have posted that you should *try* setting your sharpness at 0, to see if you like it, because *most* tvs default with artificial sharpening on. Forgive me for saying something absolute rather than leaving a bit of wiggle room in there.

Another thing people keep saying is that a lower than native resolution image will actually be improved with some artificial sharpening. Personally, I disagree and I will post two images below. The first is a 480p image being played on what I think is a 720p television (I'm in a hotel so forgive me for not knowing exactly what it is). The second image is that same television with the sharpness turned on.

Do you see how much smoother the lines are with the sharpness off? The sharpness setting just exaggerates the aliasing and makes the image look awful.
