LPT: Pack a go-bag. Throw a few clothes and a few basic supplies (toiletries, granola bars, money) in a duffel bag. Leave it in your trunk.

My wife mocks me (lovingly) for keeping a go-bag in my trunk. I recently had abdominal pains at work and had an emergency appendectomy. Guess who strolled into the ER (ok, hobbled in and practically crying) with a gym bag with pyjamas, tooth brush/paste, glasses, warm socks, device charger and headphones. 

Honestly, it made my life easier as I could be as comfortable as possible without making my wife run around putting stuff together and running the gauntlet of COVID screening to drop stuff off for me.

Edit: there are thousands of variants of go-bags and tutorials on what to pack. If you live in a hurricane zone, your bag may be different than my general purpose bag or my winter car kit. Pack something.
