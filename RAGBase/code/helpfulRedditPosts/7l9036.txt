LPT: When sending pictures to loved ones send it in a frame and write a small accompanying note to explain when and where the image was taken. What was going on in you life at the time? Place the note behind the picture inside the frame. You’ve just created a time capsule for your loved one.

My wife and I keep pictures around the house of those we love. Before my grandmother passed she sent a photo of her and my grandfather on their wedding day when we first got engaged as token of congratulations. My fiancé hated the frame but just found one she like. Upon opening the frame to change the picture a note fell out recanting what their day was like and how clearest she remembered every detail and her hopes for us and our future. 

Getting to see her handwriting and feel her well wishes mad me dig though every other picture in the house. Some had notes. Others didn’t.

From now on, I’ll be leaving a little surprise for those I love because this made my month. 

Happy holidays.
