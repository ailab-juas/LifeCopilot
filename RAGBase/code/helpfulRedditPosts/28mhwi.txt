LPT: Put your resume in your Dropbox or similar service so if you need it you can email it or print it right off your phone.

I cannot count how many times I've seen job vacancies at a number of different places without my resume on me. By the time I get home I've usually forgot the email address or the vacancy entirely.

By putting your resume on your Dropbox or any other cloud storage service you can send it to an email address right then and there on your phone. This can happen while you're at the place of employment or even just meeting someone in person. Even if you need to physically hand in a resume you can easily print off one at a print shop or certain big box retailers.

Edit: If you already knew about this tip good for you but you don't need to be dicks about it!
