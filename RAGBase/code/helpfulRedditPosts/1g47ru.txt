LPT: Picking up a new hobby? Immerse yourself in the community and you'll be more likely to stick with it

content:
Somewhere earlier today I saw a thread full of people who have problems sticking to a hobby.

So my tip is this: If you're starting a new hobby don't just read a couple of tutorials and start. **Immerse** yourself in the community for that hobby. Being a part of something really helps you stick with whatever you chose. It will help you stay motivated and inspired. It will open up new ways to look at the hobby, ways you probably couldn't have come up with yourself. It will also show you some "end-game" content: what it looks like when you've invested a lot of time into this hobby. It will enable you to visualize your goals better.

And finally, share whatever you can. Let others critique your work/collection/whatever. It will help you get better at the hobby and helps you feel connected.

Without this, you're very likely to give up on the hobby.
