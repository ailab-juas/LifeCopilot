YSK - Military Sexual Trauma can be claimed under US Military Disability!!!

**Why YSK:** This could greatly help a veteran struggling.


I just discovered that under VA disability MST (Military Sexual Trauma) is not only claimable on your filing, ~~but also categorized at 100% automatically if approved~~ I've learned this is not always the case. If you or someone you know was sexually assaulted in the military, please, please please share this with them.
