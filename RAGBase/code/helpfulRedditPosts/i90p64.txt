LPT: Telling someone that a movie/book has a great twist is, in itself, a major spoiler. Don’t do that.

content:
I’ve often seen people try to raise interest in movies by saying something like “oh plus there’s an AMAZING twist ending”. It might be common sense for most, but simply saying this can ruin how someone experiences that movie because now they’re guessing what the twist could be the whole time. When you know a twist is coming, it’s a lot easier to guess what it is.

Edit: apparently this was posted on r/books recently, had no idea
