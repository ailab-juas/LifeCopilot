YSK: There are free life saving drug programs from big pharmas for people who are uninsured / underinsured (ie insulin)

content:
I used to work for one of these pharmas call center.  We enrolled people into our program to get free supplies of insulin.  The program I worked for was LilyCares.

Before I worked there I did not know programs like this existed.  I think everyone should know about this, we all know someone that is in hard times that could use help.

Beware of advocacy groups.  They will charge you to enroll in these FREE programs.

Edit: As banjolier said not exclusive to life saving.  We did things like cymbalta, zyprexa, cialis  and prozac.
