LPT: Buy your phone from the manufacturer, not the service provider. Manufacturers offer the same or better pricing, and you can switch providers much easier and save money.

Service providers need to keep you to make money, so they make it really hard to leave. Often it's by locking you into a contract of some kind when you buy a phone. If you buy the phone from the manufacturer (apple, samsung, google, etc) they offer the same payment plans and prices, but you can move the phone to a different service company any time. Then, when your company inevitably increases your rates or starts with new fees, you can move to another. They also often offer new customers good deals, and you can keep getting those offers by switching.
