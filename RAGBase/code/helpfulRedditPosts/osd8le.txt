LPT: Only take from the center of the Nutella jar to empty it completely.

content:
My girlfriend taught me this. I found it hard to believe at first but it works time and time again.

If you only take from the center of the Nutella jar, the thickness of the Nutella stuck to the glass will pull it down. This will cause the sides to be perfectly clean by the next day. 

I suspect it is because of the cohesion of the Nutella pulling down the remains, and/or the thickness keeping the residue from drying out and sticking to the glass.

Either way, I was surprised to see her trick works really well. No endless scratching to get the remains out by the end, except for the very bottom.

I know, right? Mind blown.

EDIT LPT 1.5: There are palm oil free alternatives on the market that are equally tasty!
