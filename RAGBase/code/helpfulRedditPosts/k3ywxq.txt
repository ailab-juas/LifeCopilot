LPT: No matter how much your workplace pushes "team building" and "family culture" - remember, they're not your friends and it's still a workplace.

Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way. I work for a small business who put huge emphasis on everyone being friends and building a strong team, but it just means it hurts more when someone inevitably stabs you in the back. I'm not saying go around and be a dick to people for no reason, but it's better to build relationships outside of work or in places where there aren't any politics or power imbalances.

Edit: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up and there's too many comments now for me to keep up with. It's kind of vindicating but also sad that so many people feel the same or have had similar negative experiences. For the "my workplace isn't like this" and "my co-workers are my family" people - I hope it stays that way for you, I really do, but I'd maybe read some of the stories on this comment thread and be wary. It's better to be safe than sorry right?
