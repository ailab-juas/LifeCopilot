LPT: Need to kill wasps? Soap and water

content:
Over the summer some wasps found out about all the little crevices in the door jams of our car and took up residence.  We tried just about everything, power washing, “professional” exterminators, etc.  I was just about fed up but really didn’t want to turn to raid so I looked online.  Soap and water in a spray bottle.  Put a hefty amount of the most common dish soap in a good quality industrial spray bottle, mix it well, and go to town on the wasps.  If they come at you, the soap mist sticks to their wings and bodies and they fall right out of the sky, then it suffocates them by getting stuck in whatever hell holes they breathe out of.  Once they fall on the ground, keep spraying them so that they get coated in soap and it takes about 5 mins for them to perish.  I couldn’t believe it and didn’t get stung once. This was a very small nest mind you, maybe no more than 20-30 wasps and I was able to catch most of them on the nest itself just before sunset, so I wouldn’t recommend taking on a large nest, I was able to isolate them and only 1 to 2 came at me at a time.

Edit: for everyone making the Jainism arguments, I’m all about living and let live, but when you literally can’t use a vehicle you need to get to the doctor and live your life, that necessitates taking action, and not using poison to achieve that is what I did.  I didn’t take joy in it, but it needed to be done.  Would you risk personal injury or harm to you or your family to let wasps do their thing?
