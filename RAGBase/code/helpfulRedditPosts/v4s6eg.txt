YSK: if you need to speak into a microphone speak directly at the top and about 2 inches away.

Why YSK: the difference between doing it right and even slightly wrong makes a huge difference in the quality of sound that your audience hears. Rarely will someone come up and fix it for you mid speech so u will just sound badly.

Edit 1: I understand this does not apply to every microphone but it probably applies to about 95% of the situations in which you would be asked to speak to address a crowd.
