YSK THe "Face Mask Exemption Card" is fake and you are more than allowed to refuse service to someone using it.

content:
So there are people using something called a ["Face Mask Exemption Card"](https://i.imgur.com/05vz0IY.jpg) that claims they are exempt from wearing a mask under the ADA because of "mental and/or physical risk to me" and that refusal of service would be violating the ADA. These cards are completely fake, aren't enforceable, and (at the time of this post) the website on the card doesn't even exist. Take the card, inspect it carefully, and then throw it in the trash right before you throw the entitled Karen out of your establishment.
