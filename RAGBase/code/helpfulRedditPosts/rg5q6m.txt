title:
LPT: If somebody important in your life mentions something they want or need, WRITE IT DOWN.

content:
With it being the holiday season this is an especially good time to get into this habit for future gift getting, but also extends to helping develop stronger healthier relationships.

If its a specific physical item they either ask for or you see and know it would help them or make a good gift. Write It Down! Along with who it's for, where you found it, and the EXACT name to help find it later.

If it's a emotional want, need or desire from them, or an action expected of you. Write It Down! Note what it is and why it's important, then look back on it from time to time and reflect to see if your actions align.

And most importantly, DO NOT TELL ANYBODY.
If its a gift, note it and then act as if its inconceivable something like that would ever exist! The surprise on their face when they mention a certain Chaise Lounge (I don't know what you people buy as gifts) in March only to open it up on Christmas day is something special.
If it's an action, just try to do it more over time without expecting praise. Having it noted means you're more likely to actually make that improvement for the special somebody instead of forgetting and having the same conversation about it X months down the line.
