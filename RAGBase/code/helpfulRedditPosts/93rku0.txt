YSK that doing tons of sit ups won't give you a slimmer waist. Instead, improve your diet and incorporate lower body weight lifting to reduce your waist to hip ratio

I see a lot of women in the gym who do entire workouts training just abs with the hope of attaining an hourglass figure. Ladies, if your goal is to reduce you waist, spending hours doing sit ups is not the best training method.

When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. So when you do heavy strength training exercises to target your abs, you're encouraging these muscles to grow bigger. The result of all those weighted side planks and other exercises designed to "tone" your stomach aren't working way you think. They are "toning" those muscles by causing them to grow bigger, which in turn causes your waist to thicken.

If your goal is to reduce your waist to hip ratio, you would be better off dedicating more of your exercise time to building muscles in your lower body, plus improving your diet to reduce your overall body fat. Lower body lifts will give you a stronger, curvier butt (i.e. add inches to your hips), and improved diet will help to reduce your overall body fat (i.e. remove inches from your waist). The result? A more hourglass figure. The Mayo Clinic gives a good, more scientific [explanation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/belly-fat/art-20045809).

Don't get me wrong--core strength is important. Keep your core routine in your workout plan. But add additional lifts to your plan, too. [Lifting is not just for men](https://mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/top-10-workout-myths)! For people who are just getting into lifting, there are a lot of good plans out there to get started. When I started lifting, I found [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/) and [StrongLifts ](https://stronglifts.com/)to be good resources, but there are plenty of others out there. As always, consult a health professional if you have concerns.
