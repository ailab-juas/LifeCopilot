YSK an AAA membership card can be used as an arrest bond up to $1000 for minor traffic violations

content:
The $1,000 Guaranteed Arrest Bond is for use if you are arrested for a covered minor traffic violation. Itâ€™s just like having $1,000 in your wallet. For more serious covered traffic violations, you are protected with a $5,000 Bail Bond Certificate, which is secured by calling the nearest AAA office. Bail Bonds are insured by General Insurance Company of America. The AAA Bail Bond Certificate is provided on your statement. For your convenience, please detach the certificate and keep with your membership card. If lost or misplaced, you can call 1-800-222-1134 or visit your local AAA branch office.
