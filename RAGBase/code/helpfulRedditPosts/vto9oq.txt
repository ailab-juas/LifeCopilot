LPT: If the house you're considering buying has a chimney, get it inspected BEFORE you close.

content:
Hire a chimney sweep, on your own dime, who is reputable and experienced to go and inspect the chimney before you close on the home.

I'm a chimney sweep, and I've delivered horrible news to many homeowners who recently bought their homes and didn't get it inspected until afterwards. Realtors and sellers will probably just tell you that it might be dirty so get it cleaned afterwards, but there are so many other things that could be wrong with a chimney. 

Home inspectors, while we love you guys, are usually not chimney experts. Many don't go on the roof, and the ones that do usually don't remove the cap and look down the chimney, test for damper function, make sure the stove's clearances are met and was installed properly, etc. 

The bricks and mortar could be eroded, the flue lining might be damaged (fire hazard), the chimney could be so dirty that it's lined with flammable creosote (fire hazard), the stove could be installed improperly (fire hazard), among so many other things. Just the few things I've mentioned can be anywhere from $9,000 to $17,000 to have repaired.

We recently went out to a home sale where the seller had their own small town sweep out, who said "yeah it's mostly okay, just needs the flue reconnected to the crown, $500 should cut it." Buyer wasn't having it, called us out, and it was the worst chimney our company had ever seen. We estimated between $11,000 and $16,000 for a full repair, $11,000 being the minimum required to make the chimney even safely usable.

So please, spare me the worst part of my job, have me out *before* you buy your house.
