LPT: When people are grieving, do not throw your story on top of theirs.

content:
Sympathy is the ability to express ‘culturally acceptable’ condolences to another's plight.

Empathy is the ability to place yourself in someone else’s shoes and understand relate as best as you can to how that person feels in the situation.

Don’t assume that you know what others feel – listen to what they say, and remember to listen closely.
