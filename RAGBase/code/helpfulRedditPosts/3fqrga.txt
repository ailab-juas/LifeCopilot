YSK The mobile app Sync.me is turning your contact list into a giant reverse lookup (without consent of those listed). Your number may be listed!

content:
http://sync.me

Not the consent of the user uploading the contacts, I mean. It IS listed in the TOS under "Special Features", but what about those in that person's contact list that didn't consent?

First, i did a google search of my number.

It came up, I was little miffed.

I started searching for friends, and they came up too.

Then I searched for a friend who has a unique nickname, and lo and behold, their unique nickname showed up when I searched.

How can someone who has my info in their contacts give consent to release my information? How is that okay?
