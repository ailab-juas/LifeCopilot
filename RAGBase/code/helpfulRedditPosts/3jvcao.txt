LPT: Leftover pizza for breakfast? Try heating up your slices on a frying pan for a few minutes.

content:
Unless cold pizza is your thing, it's faster than heating up in the oven and a better texture than heating up in the microwave. 

Edit: Other important tips I've learned from the comments: get a toaster oven, add a fried egg, mix cut up pizza with eggs to make scrambled eggs, pizza french toast, put a cup of water in the microwave with the pizza you are heating up, use a cast iron pan and just eating the pizza cold like nature intended. Thanks folks!!
