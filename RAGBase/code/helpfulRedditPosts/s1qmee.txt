LPT: It’s better to negotiate a good starting salary rather than relying on raises to hit your target

content:
If you accepted a low-ball starting salary, it’s unlikely that you can rely on a raise to get you to where you want to be.  

It’s best to negotiate a starting salary to start off where you want to be.
Remember, once an offer has been made the ball is in your court and you have negotiating power.
