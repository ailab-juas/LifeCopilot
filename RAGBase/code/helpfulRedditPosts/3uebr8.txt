LPT: It's better to have no opinion on something than an uninformed one

content:
Too many people feel like they must have an opinion on *everything*.

You don't. Just like admitting when you don't know something, you can also admit that you're not informed enough about that topic to form a genuine opinion.

**EDIT:**

To be informed just means to know the 5 W's:

- Who did that?

- What happened?

- Where did it take place?

- When did it take place?

- Why did that happen?

Example: when an article gets linked on Reddit and the comments (uninformed opinions) are based on the title, when in fact the article means something else completely.
