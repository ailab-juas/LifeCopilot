YSK: Water intake plays a crucial role in any physical activity, including EATING. A little or a lot of water can make/break a meal just as easily as a workout. Hydration is the easiest, cheapest way to curb your appetite.

Why YSK: Hydration is a dead horse topic in almost all fitness communities, but most overlook extending this to one's eating habits. If you do, you'll find it much easier to say no to large(r) meals. This general approach has been shown to hold water (lol) in a number of published studies.^[[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893719/)[[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29678599/)[[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6209729/)[[4]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26237305/)

 &amp;nbsp;

I know, I sound like a missionary from r/hydrohomies, but hear me out. As a PharmD I field a lot of the general public's questions about nutrition, meal substitution, and the efficacy of market diet aids. In almost all circumstances it need not be so complicated. As the title states, the act of consumption is a physical process, and we can directly impact this biological imperative with an appropriate level of hydration. Far more than people realize.

 &amp;nbsp;

Having trouble controlling how much you eat? **Try controlling how much you drink instead.** Water (or your drink of choice; preferably non-carbonated/sugar) can help you on both ends of the spectrum:

 &amp;nbsp;

Want to get a second wind (plate) to finish your workout (meal) strong? Take a **small** swig of a drink. A small drink can rehydrate you as well as tamp down stomach contents to make room for more. In contrast...want to reduce portion sizes, but are still hungry? Drink **up to 2 full glasses** before your meal. This fills the stomach, and as water is incompressible, you are left with little room for anything else. It becomes much easier to say no to (more) food. We've all experienced what a hassle it can be to do any kind of activity with a stomach filled to the brim with a beverage. All that sloshing around puts a damper on any immediate plans. It also sates your body's thirst response which can often be misconstrued as hunger. 

 &amp;nbsp;

I suggest keeping this advice within an appropriate frame of reference, specifically a traditional 3-meal plan (breakfast/lunch/dinner) as you absolutely can overhydrateâ€”trust me, it's not fun. It's unwise to drink a full glass every time you wanna eat some chips lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

Necessary disclaimer that this is not the end-all-be-all of dieting advice. It is adjunct to a proper nutritionally-balanced, calorie-limited diet, and (at least some modest) weekly physical activity or exercise. **There are no corners to cut in being your best you.** Follow this advice specifically at mealtime. Stick to drinking only when thirsty at all other times of day to avoid overhydrating, and watch the pounds/kilos fall off.

Lookin' good, King/Queen!
