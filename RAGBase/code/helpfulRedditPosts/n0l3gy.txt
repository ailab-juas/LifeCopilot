LPT: Whenever you start judging someone for something they can't control, tell yourself this "your insecurities are showing" It'll stop you from being mean for no reason.

I've been doing this for a while and it significantly improved my mental health and I've become more empathetic. 
I have many insecurities, about my body, my lack of employment, material things......
But sometimes I see someone and start Thinking about how bad their outfit is, or how cheap their car us, or how a certain facial feature isn't pretty...
That's when one day it hit, this is my defense mechanism, I'm so insecure that I jump on the opportunity (although all of this happens in my own mind) to criticize what other people have, and try to feel better because I'm not *like* them.

But, I've been depressed before because I couldn't change certain things about myself, I still sometimes feel unpretty, I'm old enough to be working but I still got no job or car....

Since I started reminding myself, and telling myself that exact phrase I have been feeling better about myself and have been " feeling kinder" towards people too. I haven't chosen many problems that I currently have, and they probably haven't too. If I bring someone down because of something they may or may not chose then I should expect the same to be done to me....and i'll be going in circles....

Judging people for the sake of feeling superior will never be the answer. Remember that!
