LPT A promotion isn't always a good thing. Be sure to review all parts of the potential job before accepting.

Look at more than salary. Look at pay vs hours worked, responsibility, new perks, added stress, loss of existing perks (maybe going from remote to in person), travel % and any potential risks (for example being a sales manager and not hitting quota).

Lastly, objectively look if you are suited or even qualified for it. The Peter principle is real and can make you life suck.
