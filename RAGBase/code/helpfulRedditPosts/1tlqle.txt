LPT: If you have a goPro or similar camera you're likely to lose. Save an If_found.txt file on the SD card with an email address and an 'If lost, please contact...' message.

content:
If lost / if found, whatever you want to say. 
This is in response to the 'I've just lost my goPro on a beach in Maui' message. 

EDIT: Yes, I also write my email on the chip also. And on a post-it stuck to the back of the camera.... and on the USB key on my keyring (on an email that couldn't be traced to my address)
