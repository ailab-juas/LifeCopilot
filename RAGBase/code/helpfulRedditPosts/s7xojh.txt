LPT: Even if you don’t know CPR, try.

content:
Context- In Oct 2020, I was training at a jujitsu gym when I dropped dead on the mat. I had zero symptoms or warning signs. Had already ran and lifted weights earlier in the day. 
I have no memory of being at jujitsu but was told that I was about to start a roll with someone and just dropped to the mat. 
Luckily others realized I was in trouble (I guess turning blue and not moving was a sign) and they began chest compressions. I was told later it was only compressions and no breaths (this was at height of covid panic so no one was gonna do mouth to mouth on a stranger). They managed to get my heart restarted and the ambulance got me to the hospital in time for a cardiologist to perform his magic. 

While I did have some lingering chest pain from the compressions damaging the cartilage, that has since faded away and I feel completely normal. I run daily and lift weights. Some minor short term memory issues but nothing I’ll ever complain about. 

So please, Just try. The person is already dead. You’re not gonna make them more dead but you can give them a chance. I’m now sitting on the sofa with my 2 young children and living life as best I can thanks to someone trying.

*Update: Thanks for the awards and the attention this post received. 

I didn’t mention the fact that they only did compressions and not breaths as a complaint whatsoever. Whatever they did worked and I’m here alive and well. I’ll never second guess their decisions that day. It wasn’t their fault that I dropped on the mat and I’m extremely grateful that they chose to do something.
