YSK: There are over 200 islands to visit in Greece - Mykonos and Santorini are not the best options

content:
Why YSK: Most non Greek people (especially Americans) I have met, are aware of our beautiful islands but usually only know Mykonos and Santorini.

Both of those are obviously beautiful, but they are usually way overpriced and extremely crowded (to the point where itâ€™s going to be very difficult to admire the view etc between June and August). 

There are literally over 200 equally (if not more) magnificent islands and even more coastal places in Greece, that you can visit for less than half the money you would spend to go to Mykonos. 

Some examples:

Interesting architecture, ancient landmarks and many options for everyone: Rhodos 

Big island that has literally EVERYTHING (even a pink beach) a unique culture and incredible relics of Minoan civilisation: Crete

Similar to Santorini but with even better beaches and a panoramic view of the Aegean: Milos 

Hip island for the lovers of free camping and a chill vibe, with many local festivals: Ikaria

Rich culture with a magnificent shipwreck, rich vegetation and great nightlife: Zakinthos

Lots of green with good food and decent nightlife, but not too wild: Skiathos

ETA: according do the stats, the post has now 630k views. I am wondering if this post actually changes the islands some tourists visit!
