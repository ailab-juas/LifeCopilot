LPT: You don't need to be friends with everyone at work.

content:
I learned this the hard way. I thought I could be friends with everyone. Wrong. All you need to do is be professional. Do your work. DOCUMENT anything important. Go home. 

Some people are just dicks/assholes. Protect yourself and be objective. No one owes you anything and go in there expecting nothing. Let your work speak for itself.
