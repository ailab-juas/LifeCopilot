LPT: If you or your family will be responsible for cleaning out an elderly relative's home when they pass, consider doing some of it when they are still alive.

content:
My grandfather passed recently and we started in on cleaning his home out. I wish we would have taken the advice I'm giving now because I know that giving him the opportunity to tell all the stories attached to each picture and knick knack would light him up like a Christmas tree. He would've seen things he forgot he ever had. I know it would've been a really powerful bonding experience to have before he passed.

EDIT: To everyone saying it would be a bad idea to say something like "hey grandma you're gonna die soon, can we rifle through all your shit?" Ummm yeah. That would be a bad idea. Use some tact. Be respectful. This obviously won't work for everyone. Hence the word "consider" in the title.
