YSK: the new plastic Snapple bottles do not have tamper-resistent seals.

content:
The new plastic Snapple bottles still use the metal \*pop\* caps. This was effective for glass bottles, however plastic bottles can be squeezed as the cap is placed back on... leaving a vacuum and sealing the bottle again. 

This was well demonstrated by this youtuber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x5T_u1VTTY&amp;t=86

If you don't know why this is a *serious* risk, do a quick read about the [Chicago Tylenol murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tylenol_murders). **7 deaths** due to a lack of tamper-resistant packaging. 

Do not buy plastic Snapple bottles if they have metal caps.
