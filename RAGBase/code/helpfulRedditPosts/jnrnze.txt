LPT: Make a habit to correct you back posture. Start by doing it right now.

Edit: for a post I made while on the shitter at work this blew way more than I expected. I know I fucked up the title, but you got the point, English is not my first language so I am sorry. Thanks a lot for all the awards.

Also, I want to add a few things.

You should really take care of your posture, your back will love you in the long run. A fellow reddior commented a really good "guide" on how to take care of your back and posture, you will find it somewhere down below in the comments. 

Also, if you have back problems, please go to the doctor, don't try to fix your back yourself by various exercises you find on the internet and under no circumstances you should buy straps to keep your back straight without going to the medic first. 

A friend of mine had a bad posture problem and was considering getting one of those straps that forces you to keep your back straight. He went to the doctor and the doctor  told him he should exercise his shoulders and back, because his muscles we're weak and could not keep his back straight all the time. Because of that, the strap would've just made that worst, so consult a medic first before doing anything that could impact your health.
