title:
YSK If your kids are in need of more structure, you shouldn't give them too many warnings before doling out discipline as they'll take the initial threat of it less seriously than they would over more consistent and immediate correction

Why YSK: Kids will try to get away with as much as they can and will constantly test the limits of your authority as a parent. If you provide too many warnings it turns the situation into a game for them where they may wait until you reach a breaking point and lose your cool before listening to you.
