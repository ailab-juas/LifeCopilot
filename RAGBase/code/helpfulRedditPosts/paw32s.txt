LPT: Don't forget to reverse image search pics of people you're chatting with to avoid being catfished

content:
Edit: double check with websites like tinEye, since google sometimes doesn't have reliable results

Edit2: as others have pointed out, yandex has a superior algorythm. Flip/mirror the image to be extra safe
