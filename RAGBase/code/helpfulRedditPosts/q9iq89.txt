title:
LPT: if someone much older is interested in dating you, consider that they are immature for their age rather than assuming you are more mature.

content:
It can be flattering when an older person shows interest in you. When you’re 21 and a 30 year old wants to date you it’s easy to think that you’re mature for your age. Instead, consider that they are immature- ask yourself why a 30 year old may be interested in someone 9 years younger and take the time to think about whether you’re on the same level because you’re ahead of the curve or because they have fallen behind.
