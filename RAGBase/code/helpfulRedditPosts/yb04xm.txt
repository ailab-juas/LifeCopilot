YSK that CVS has free, well kept single use bathrooms at over 9,600 locations

content:
Why YSK: If you're like me, it can be hard to go #2 in public, especially without privacy. When on road trips, I used to go for days without shitting because I couldn't seem to go in a public restroom with people constantly going in and out, and couldn't find single use bathrooms. 

But with CVS, they're everywhere and most have free bathrooms that are often unlocked by employees, so they're typically single use. This has been a game changer, since many convenience stores have different variations of bathrooms (even Walmart). 

I'm sure there are other places, and if so please comment so us shy-shitters can have a bigger list!

Editb shitting not shutting lol
