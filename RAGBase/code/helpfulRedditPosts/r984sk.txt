title:
LPT. If you have to say no offense before you say something. It's probably best left unsaid.

content:
Saying no offense doesn't mean the person you are talking to won't be offended. Maybe take a moment, think about if what you are about to say. Some comments are best kept to yourself

Edit: I should clarify. What I mean is, saying no offense don't mean what ever your going to say next, shouldn't offend someone. If you truly don't want to offend them maybe it's best left unsaid. If it's something that needs to be said, skip the no offense and just say it, because it's probably going to offend them anyways.
