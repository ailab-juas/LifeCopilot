LPT: If a dog is asking you to follow it, you should go.

content:
A lot of dogs are instinctively trained to go seek out help when their owner is having a medical emergency or is in need of immediate assistance. So if a dog is acting like it wants you to go after it, it wouldnâ€™t hurt to go see what it wants. You may end up saving a life.
