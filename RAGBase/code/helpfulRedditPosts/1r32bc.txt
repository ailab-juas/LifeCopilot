**But PirateMunky, I ride my bike all the time/only people who are unlucky get their bike stolen!**
&gt;  Awesome! I'm glad you ride a lot and haven't had a bike stolen! Reading these tips should help keep that bike not stolen. It only takes one moment of forgetfulness or laziness (eg. *"I'll only be inside for a minute!"*) to lapse into a bad bike locking practice. And that's definitely what those bike thieves count on!

**But PirateMunky, I don't own a bike/ride a bike very often!**

&gt; It's actually MORE important that you know how to do it because when you do ride a bike, it'll be borrowed and you won't be in the practice of finding a good place to secure the bike you own. Or, maybe some time in the future, you might meet someone, fall for each other, settle down, and have a rug rat or two. Chances are, one of those young uns will grow to the age where they want their own bike. If you buy them that bike but you fail to teach them how to properly lock the bike you just spent your hard earned money on, and that bike is stolen, I'll bet you'd wish that you would have known how to teach good bike locking practices to those kids! So stop being a bad (hypothetical future) parent and bone up on your bike locking skills!

**But PirateMunky, you're obviously trying way too hard to be entertaining and a bit preachy and I downvote people like you on principle!**
&gt;Sorry. I don't get out much. Good on you for having standards though. It's important to have standards. I deserve the downvote and your judgement. Hope your day gets better!
