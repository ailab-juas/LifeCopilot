LPT: Google docs has a very accurate free OCR (image to text) function built in

content:
While looking for something to OCR documents (converting a scanned image into live text) with I came across this nifty feature of Google docs: You can OCR any image including multi-page scans if they're saved as PDF, and the accuracy is great.

To use the OCR feature you upload the scanned image / PDF to Google Drive, then right click and select "Open With &gt; Google Docs". It'll then open it with each page as both the original scanned image and editable text.

If you're doing large volumes dedicated software is probably better as you have to upload everything to Google Drive first, but for occasional OCRing it works great.
