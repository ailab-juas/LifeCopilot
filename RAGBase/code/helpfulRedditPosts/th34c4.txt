YSK about the nasal cycle - many people breathe mostly (75%) through one nostril at a time and the dominant nostril alternates throughout the day. You might have septum deviation if you feel like your nose is congested most of the time (due to this cycle).

Why YSK: It might help you discover that your nasal septum is deviated and consulting a doctor might help you finally breathe normally again.

Learned this the hard way after 10 years.
