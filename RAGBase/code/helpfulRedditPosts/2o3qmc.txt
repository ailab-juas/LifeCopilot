LPT: If you find yourself in a situation of emergency, instead of yelling "Someone call 911" point to someone and tell them to call

content:
So I just watched a video where someone was stabbed and everyone is yelling "Somebody call 911!", and of course nobody does.

But if you point to one person in a crowd and tell them to call 911, they'll feel responsible to do so because someone told them to. If he/she doesn't make the call, it's on them to be blamed for potentially losing a life.

Edit: To people saying that this is old and you've been taught in class etc. You have no idea how many people are not aware of this. 
To people saying you should call yourself. This is advice for a situation where you are unable to call, e.g. when you attend to a victim, give cpr etc.
