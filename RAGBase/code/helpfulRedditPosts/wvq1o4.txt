title:
LPT: if you are unsure whether a task is something that should be done during a work break or counted as work hours, ask yourself "would I be doing this task if I didnt have this job?"

content:
For example: one of the tasks at work is watering the plants. It may be simple enough to water the plants during a break time, especially if you enjoy taking care of plants. However, if you did not work at that office or have that job, you probably wouldn't be watering those plants. *This task should be counted towards your work hours and not your free time*.

Depending on the situation, this can be applied to checking/sorting mail, picking up supplies, refueling gas for the company vehicle, loading your truck, cleaning the equipment, or even researching options for a future task. If it's for your particular job position, don't give out free labor. Your personal time is valuable and should be treated as such.

Sheesh I didn't think so many people would find this helpful. And yes, as the office admin for my company/building, making coffee, watering plants, and purchasing supplies at the store are work tasks expected of me. I used to do this on my break etc since they are simple tasks, but after some thinking I decided to stop doing that.

Additionally, as many have pointed out, every office/job is different, some people have commented that YES you can clock work hours for your commute, and YES you can write off pants as a work expense. I wouldn't try it but hey, depending on how great your argument is, maybe it will work? Idk I'm just your friendly neighborhood redditor and this is only a tip.

AdditionallyÂ², YES you should be pooping on company time.

Take care and plant trees.
