YSK: Talking about your wages is not against the law and you should as it's more likely to result in you having a better wage/salary

content:
Why YSK: the stigma around discussing your wages/salary is unjustified and is driven by employers wanting to take advantage of paying employees different amounts for the same work. You have every right to discuss your wages and may be protected by law depending on what country/ state you are in.
