LPT: DO NOT internalize/ try to dismiss your feelings when you experience a traumatic life event.

content:
I know most people have already heard this before, but itâ€™s worth reiterating. When I was 21 y/o my mother passed away unexpectedly right before I was set to deploy with a MEU. I was on a boat surrounded by my infantry company for close to 8 months, so I put up a false front and tried to power thru. This will only compound the the emotional toll on yourself. My fairly recent marriage, my relationships with my family, and my mental health all suffered as a result.

Do not be embarrassed or afraid to seek help, you are not weak for having these emotions. 

Stay strong, things will get better.
