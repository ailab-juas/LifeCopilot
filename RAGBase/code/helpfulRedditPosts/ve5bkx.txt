YSK: If your vet is saying you should consider your pet's "quality of life" they are indirectly telling you it's time to consider putting them to sleep.

Why YSK: More often than not, your veterinarian wants to do what is best for you and your pet, but introducing the topic of euthanasia can be very touchy or even risky. It's a difficult topic and generally won't be brought up by your vet directly, (at least in my experience) but you can look for key phrases such as, "the prognosis is not good" or, "you need to think about their quality of life." These are gentle ways of suggesting that it might be time to make the call, at which point you may be well advised to look into all of the options available to help your pet through their situation, including euthanasia. 

I think this is important to call out as it can be difficult for many to identify these cues, especially in such a stressful time, and if they are missed it could lead down the road of unnecessary medical procedures and prolonging the inevitable introducing undue stress for the caretakers (emotional and financial) as well as for the pet when there is no clear expectation of recovery. It's very easy to ask "what do we do next" but if the diagnostic procedures or treatments aren't expected to lead to a sustainable recovery, saying goodbye is likely the most humane decision to make. 

If you find yourself in the very unfortunate situation where this decision must be made (and most who care for pets likely will) it's important to be able to identify these cues to help navigate the situation.

Edit: queues to cues
