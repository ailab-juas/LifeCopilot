LPT: Stop chasing after people

content:
Do you have that friend you already asked to do something together three times and got stood up every time?

Do you have that girl or boy you have a crush on, but they rejected every single one of your advances?

Stop chasing after people. These people already showed you they don't respect you. You can't make somebody respect you, you can only respect yourself. Accept the possibility that they might never return and move on with your life - if they reach out to you, great! If not, also great!

Find other friends, find another partner. Find somebody who wants to spend time with you as much as you want to spend time with them. Life is short and should not be wasted on people who don't appreciate your friendship.
