Why YSK: The use of tanning beds drastically increases your risk of skin cancer, especially when you use them at a young age

The use of tanning beds before age 35 increases the risk of melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, by 75%. In 2014, the estimated lifetime risk for Caucasians was 1 in 48 (compared to African Americans whose risk was 1 in 1000). Skin melanoma has increased alarmingly, more than doubling in incidence in the past 30 years making it the most rapidly increasing form of cancer in that time period.
