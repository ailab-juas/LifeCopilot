title:
YSK Not to hang tinsel or garland that covers your house numbers

content:
I work as a delivery driver in a residential-heavy area. As of this week, I've had a much more difficult time finding the correct houses because everyone is hanging tinsel and garlands from their porches, driveway lights, etc, that block view of their house number.

Why YSK:
This is one of the busiest times of the year, in one of the craziest years in the history of online shopping and deliveries. Please do us a favor and remove anything obstructing the view of your house numbers. Your delivery drivers will thank you!
