title:
Cleaning your microwave?

content:
The easiest way to clean your microwave is to put a cup of hot water and normal vinegar inside, turn it on for about 3-4 minutes. Once it's done, those tough stubborn bits of food should glide right off with a simple wipe if a damp cloth! Easy :-)


Edit: mix a cup of white vinegar and water
The mix I would use is about 1/3 vinegar 2/3 water but you can try it out and mix how you think works best
