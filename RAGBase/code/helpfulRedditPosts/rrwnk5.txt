LPT: Many dishes can be cooked using one method. Learn this method and you can cook for yourself and others.

content:
Finely chop an onion and begin to fry it in a pan with a little oil or butter. Finely chop some garlic and add that to the onions and fry for 1 minute before adding spices and frying for another minute or 2 (add a splash of water it too dry). Add 1 or 2 tins of tomatoes (depending how big the batch of food you want) and stir. Cook the sauce through and blend or leave chunky and add any herbs you desire. Fry any meat and add to the sauce until cooked. Vegetables can also be added.

Add the following to create different dishes. 

Garam masala and curry spices to make a simple curry. 

Chilli powder spices to make a chilli. 

Basil and oregano to make a pasta/bolgnaise sauce.

Stock water and vegetables to make a soup (cook vegetables thoroughly and blend)

You can even add other spices and flavours and meats and vegetables to invent your own creations. If you keep it simple it's hard to get it wrong.... be confident and have fun with it. Taste your food as it cooks (not raw meat) and add whatever it needs.... Too sweet, add salt. Too acidic/bitter, add sugar/sweetness and so on. These meals can be made cheaply in big batches and stored in the fridge or freezer. Cooking is fun so start simple and experiment a little more each time.
