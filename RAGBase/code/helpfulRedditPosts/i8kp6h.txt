YSK that sounding like you know everything makes you sound like an idiot

content:
One of my classmates had a habit of saying "I know" after anything that was introduced to him, even though it was clear that he didn't. It just makes you look stupid, so please, it's okay to admit when you don't know something, chances are the person will explain it to you and you'll know better.
