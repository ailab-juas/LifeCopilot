LPT: When tightening your budget, commit to simultaneously raising your quality of life by every means available to you.

content:
I'm talking about things like taking advantage of everything that's free (libraries, museums, galleries, national parks, whatever floats your boat), tidying up and shifting things around in your home so it looks better, making time to hang out with people who lift you up, preparing the food and playing the music and wearing the clothes you like best. It helps the whole experience to be positive and uplifting and empowering instead of just feeling like deprivation.
