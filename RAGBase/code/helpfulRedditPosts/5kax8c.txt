LPT: Dont know if your house is the only one without power? Check surrounding WiFi networks, if none are showing up, your house isnt the only one

content:
EDIT: Oh my goodness, front page! Thanks Reddit! I guess something good did happen this Christmas :). Also in my situation, the power went out during the day time so I couldn't tell if people's lights were on or off. I guess if it is night time then looking outside would be easier, but checking the WiFi is just another option. Merry Christmas / Happy Holidays everyone!

EDIT2: I think some people are getting the wrong message. This really only applies to suburban residents, and is only particularly useful when it is day time. Nevertheless, I understand the controversy. This LPT is only for a select few, sorry if it doesn't apply to you
