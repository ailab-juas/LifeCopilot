LPT: Buy gas while on Walt Disney World property

content:
The gas stations on Walt Disney World property, all of which are run by Hess, are price regulated to the average gas price in Florida. Thus, the fuel price at these stations are very reasonable. Walt Disney World did this mainly for the employees that work there, but anyone can buy their gas there.  If you go outside of the WDW property you may end up paying 2X as much.
