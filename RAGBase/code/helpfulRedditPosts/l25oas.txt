title:
YSK the irs website has links to 100% free filing services by popular tax services.

content:
Why YSK: these filing services will not advertise them as to make you use the pay for services instead, even though you don't need to. There was even a lawsuit filed against them for such practices.

The basic qualification is to be under a certain income range (30-75k a year in income depending on service provider.)

great if you're someone who's doing their taxes for the first time, or don't have a complex tax situation.
