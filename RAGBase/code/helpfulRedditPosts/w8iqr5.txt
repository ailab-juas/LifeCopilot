LPT: If you’re arguing with someone and they throw out “I don’t care” as a response to a a solid point. Just stop there.

content:
People who do this are basically just telling you that they don’t care if you’re making good solid points. They’re barely even listening and will likely never admit they’re wrong. Worst case scenario you get a little worked up and say or do something you’ll regret. Just walk away.
