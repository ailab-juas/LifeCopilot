LPT: an argument is NOT you vs another person. It's you and another person vs. the problem.

content:
Whether with a partner, friend, or in the workplace, this shift in perspective can massively shape both how cordial and how effective you are at tackling the issues that cause disagreement. If you are at odds with another person, it can turn conflict into resolution, and build friendship from hostility. 

Take a step back. Identify the root of the friction. Lay out your opinions on it, and come up with a solution together.

This should be common sense, but it isn't - if you ever find yourself attacking someone's character, making an argument from authority, or criticising someone behind their back, then you're doing it wrong.

It's not always easy, but it makes life so much easier.

EDIT: Blown away by the feedback and my first award! Thank you so much! From the comments, I feel one thing needs to be added: 

Lots of people are asking about what happens if you adopt this perspective and the other person does not. My advice: stick to your guns. Let them insult you and make irrelevant points; respond by brushing these attacks aside and focussing on the problem. If they don't come around, it's not worth arguing. 

One of my favourite phrases on the subject: Arguing with an idiot is like playing chess with a pigeon. No matter how carefully you play, they're just gunna knock over the pieces, poo on the board and strut around like they've won!
