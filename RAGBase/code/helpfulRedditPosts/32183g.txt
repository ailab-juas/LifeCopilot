LPT: Enjoy tastier frozen microwaved foods by using your microwave's power settings. Double the time and halve the power and you'll notice a delightful difference in taste and texture.

Frozen foods are becoming healthier and tastier so why ruin it by zapping it so much it becomes burnt and rubbery. I'm 30 years old and just recently started doing this so I figured there must be others ignoring this common sense feature. I don't always eat microwavable meals, but when I do, I use the power settings.
