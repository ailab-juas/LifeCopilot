LPT: if a loved one is taken in an ambulance, do not follow us to the hospital. Go there on your own time and own route.

content:
As a medic, whenever I was loading a patient in the ambulance, a family member would inevitably run up to me, keys in hand saying “I’ll follow you to the ER”. 

No. 

People in an emotional state following another vehicle will develop tunnel vision and forget all traffic laws. You will blow stop signs. You will follow me right through an intersection even if the light has already turned red for you. And you will slam into the back of the ambulance if we need to make a sudden stop. Remember, the patient faces backwards and can see out the back window as you blow a red light and get t-boned by an overloaded ice cream truck. 

After we leave, wait ten minutes, take a deep breath and slowly make your way to the hospital.
