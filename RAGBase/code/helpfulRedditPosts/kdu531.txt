YSK negotiations work best if you focus on interests, concerns, desires, not positions.

WHY YSK: 

Negotiation is a necessary part of life. You have to negotiate with your family, coworkers and boss, even Reddit posters and mods. But if you negotiate based on position, it is likely that you will face many difficulties, especially because people become more committed to their positions as the argument continues, and then egos really get involved. When that happens, there can only be winners and losers. And it doesn't matter if you use hard bargaining or soft bargaining.

You will have less success if you use **principled negotiation**:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**1.** Concentrate on interests, not positions: Positional bargaining is inefficient, contributes to each side becoming overly committed to their initial position, and often results in anger and resentment. The real issues are often related not to positions but to the conflicts “between each side's needs, desires, concerns, and fears” (p. 40).4 For instance, a complex conflict between you and a real estate developer next door might really be about your need for quiet and the developer’s need for money.  
&gt;  
&gt;**2.** Concentrate on the problem, not on people: When you focus on finding a solution to the problem, not defeating your opponent, egos are less likely to get in the way. But in situations where you do need to focus on people, do try to appreciate and value their input, see them as partners (not opponents), respect their autonomy and status, and be mindful of the roles they (and you) are playing in the negotiations.  
&gt;  
&gt;**3.** Explore a variety of options: Since making decisions in the presence of your opponent or searching for only one (perfect) solution hampers creativity, set aside some time to come up with a variety of mutually beneficial solutions before working on reaching an agreement.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4.** Use objective criteria: To prevent a negotiator from getting advantageous results by simply being very stubborn, make sure the final agreement reflects an objective standard that does not depend only on the will of the parties.

Of course, nothing is quite as satisfying as defeating someone in a conflict and if that's your goal, then that's fine. But if you are more concerned with getting what you want and less concerned with dominating or overpowering another person, then try this method.
