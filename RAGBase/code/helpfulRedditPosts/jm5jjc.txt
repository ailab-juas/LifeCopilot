YSK masturbation is good for your prostate health and may lower your risk of prostate cancer. [NSFW]

content:
Okay, last edit bc people don’t read to the bottom: Do as you please with your willy. I have since realized that many studies about this subject are inconclusive. Porn is bad for you (eroticfilms.com might be a healthy-ish alternative); release through sex OR self pleasure is good but dopamine can make you want to do it often. Just take care of yourself. If you want to discipline yourself using NNN go ahead.


Why YSK: no nut november is upon us. Those who partake in it may be doing more harm than good. (edit - everyone is different in this regard. NNN is an opportunity to practice self-control and rewire your brain concerning your sexuality.)

Some studies speculate that the act of ejaculation dispels harmful chemicals that build up in semen.

Not to mention, masturbation is good for you in general. It helps relieve stress and cloudy judgement and it feels good. If you’re excessively masturbating, that’s another thing, and maybe cold turkey is your plan of action to getting better. But men, don’t withhold yourself just because of something that got memed out 2 years ago.

Anyway, good luck.

Edit: I should clarify that if you struggle with addiction to porn/masturbation and NNN is something you believe will help you combat that, by all means, best of luck to you. The purpose of my post is to combat stigma around masturbation and help people recognize it is not a behavior to be ashamed of. I guess I should also add that I am a woman and I won’t tell you what to do with your body.
