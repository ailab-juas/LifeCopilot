A college degree is not the end-all-be-all it once was. Blue collar jobs are in great demand right now and for those who donâ€™t believe that college is the path they would like to take, consider a trade! 

Many have paid internships and training, and any debt is usually able to be paid within the first 2-3 years, if not completing your entire training debt free!
