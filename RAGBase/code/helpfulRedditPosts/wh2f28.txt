LPT: How to cancel gym membership over the phone with no hassle.

content:
Cancelling a gym membership is one of the hardest things to do in life. One easy hack I've found...look up a small town or city that doesn't have that particular gym, and then call and tell them you've moved and simply forgot to cancel beforehand. They'll ask where have you moved to, (so they can direct you to go to a local gym to cancel of course) at which point tell them the city/town that you already looked up. They'll have no choice but to process the cancellation right there over the phone.

Just tried it and it worked like a charm. Let me know if it works for you!
