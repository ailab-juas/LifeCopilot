title:
YSK that Collagen and Gelatin are always from animals and there is no vegetable source.

content:
Collagen is that protein that makes up most of our bodies, our connective tissues, skin, bones, arteries..

Gelatin is just processed collagen. 

In the plant kingdom, they're not made out of proteins like us, but out of cellulose fibre, a carbohydrate.

So when you have a vegetable alternative to things that are traditionally made with gelatin, you don't use a plant protein, but plant fibre. It's that structure-creating vibe of these molecules that provides structure to things we need gelatinized or glued together or thickened or whatever.

Collagen supplements are huge nowadays. These are made from animal hides and bones or maybe fish scales or chicken sternums/crops. There is no vegetable that produces collagen, but I think a company called ~~Gelita~~ Geltor has introduced bacterial gelatin, I guess from a GMO bacterium. 

Collagen supplements are extra-processed gelatin, btw. Gelatin is long tangles of protein that hold their shape and hold water. Collagen supplements break these tangles up into small pieces that dissolve into water, hold no shape, and are easier to absorb intact.

F to the y i. Thank you for your kind attention.
