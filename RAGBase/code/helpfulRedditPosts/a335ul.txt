YSK it's super easy to get a visa to live and work in Australia and New Zealand

content:
Preface: I'm American so a fair amount of the specific knowledge I have will apply to Americans. I will try to provide general information about the status of other countries, but be sure to check out the immigration web sites of both Australia and New Zealand for the most complete, up to date requirements and restrictions. If this doesn't gain much traction tonight, I will likely repost this word for word tomorrow to get the news out.

Ok, So there's a visa, called the working holiday visa that allows people from North America, South America, Europe and Asia to work and live in both New Zealand and Australia. For some countries in these continents there are limited spaces. In America there are unlimited spaces in New Zealand for this type of visa. I'm not entirely sure about Australia and to be honest I'm a bit lazy to look up the specifics, but I'll link the immigration website so you can put in your circumstances to see if you qualify for the visa.

You can work in any unskilled/minimally skilled job for up to a year and see two beautiful countries in the process. For New Zealand the cutoff age is 35, for Australia the cut off age is 30. DO NOT get both of the visas at the same time, enter both countries (therefore validating them) and spend all of your time in only one country like I did. Because you can only have these visas once. By unskilled/minimally skilled jobs I mean working in restaurants, agriculture, sales, hotels/hostels, or in the wine industry. In Australia you're only allowed to keep a job for 6 months before you're forced to find a new job. In New Zealand you can work the same job for the entire time. There's a TON of Europeans (specifically Germans and French) who are taking advantage of this visa right out of high school. They take a "gap-year" to travel and work before starting university. Clearly I've taken advantage of this visa, and upon returning to the States I espoused the opportunity in countless bars to one-off friends who generally seemed excited, yet intimidated by the opportunity. There's only one person that I've persuaded to pursue this opportunity, and I feel proud of that. But today I want to spread the news far and wide. Let me know if you have any questions that the website specifically don't address.

Here's the link for \[Australia\]([https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/work-holiday-417](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/work-holiday-417))

Anyways hit me up with questions if you have them and also check the websites for your specific circumstances.
