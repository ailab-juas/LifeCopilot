LPT : clearly state what you want in the first line of your e-mail, and only give the explaination / context afterwards

content:
It saves so much time  and cognitive load for your reader â€“ it also makes you look more  professional, in my opinion. I  also find it a lot easier to write e-mails that way ; I don't have to  think how to explain my request; I just ask, then explain why.

Just be precise and straight-to-the point for the beginning :

&gt;*Hello, I am writing to you about project XXX ; can you send me the minutes of the last meeting, of this monday ?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I was away because of COVID, and would like to catchup because blahblablablah (you can pretty much go on for as long as you want at this point)*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Thanks*
