LPT: use oil to once and for all banish acne ridden skin

content:
I've suffered with acne since my late teen years, I'm now almost 30. I've tried just about every product on the market (aside from prescription) and never had any luck with any of them. 


I started doing some research, and found the Oil Cleansing Method, or OCM. It has been 2 years now since I started, and I have not had a single pimple since. So I thought I'd share with you, reddit!




**How it works**

We all know our skin produces natural oils. These oils hydrate and protect your skin. OCM works by daily replacing dirty oil with clean oil, rather than stripping the oil from your skin completely (which is what common cleansers do). 


**How to**


To make your oil cleanser you will need 3 things: Coconut oil, Castor Oil (found in the laxatives section of your pharmacy), and a clean bottle to store it in.


Start with this ratio: 90% coconut oil, 10% castor oil mixed in your storage bottle.


Every night before bed, massage a quarter size amount into your skin. Next, take a clean wash cloth and wet it with hot water (don't scald yourself, however!), and gently wipe your face clean. Dry, and you're all done! 


*only wash your face a maximum of one time per day!* that's all your skin needs. In the morning, just splash your face with some cool water, nothing more.


After a few days, if your skin feels too dry, increase the coconut oil and decrease the amount of castor oil in your mixture. Likewise, if your skin feels too oily, increase castor oil and decrease coconut oil. Be very careful with the amount of castor oil you are using though, as it can severely dry out your skin.



**Results** 


For the first few days, washing with oil is going to feel very counterintuitive. After you wash and dry your face, your skin will still feel oily (obviously), but this is ok! The oil is acting as a moisturizer. After you wake up the next morning, your face should not feel oily any more.


I saw improvements in my skin after just the first day, and I haven't looked back since.


I hope this helps some of you out there struggling with acne!


Good luck!



**EDIT**

As has been pointed out, I forgot to mention that coconut oil is comedogenic, meaning that it may clog pores. I have had great success with coconut oil, but others may find it does not work for their skin.


There are several other base oils that you can use in place of coconut oil, however. Extra Virgin cold pressed olive oil, Jojoba oil, and Sweet Almond are among the highest recommended.


I do recommend starting with a lower castor oil ratio because too much castor oil can severely dry out your skin, whereas too much base oil can simply be wiped away. 


This is an all natural face cleansing process that has worked for me personally and countless others, but this isn't a miracle cure. If you try this process and your skin doesn't improve or gets worse, you should stop treatment and seek professional advice from a dermatologist.
