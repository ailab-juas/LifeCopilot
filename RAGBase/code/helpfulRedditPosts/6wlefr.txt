After a hurricane or flood there is a risk of several thousand flood damaged cars infiltrating the market. Get a vehicle history from a reputable source. Also, take the time to inspect the vehicle or get a car savvy friend or mechanic to look it over. 

Here is a link on flooded cars.

Finally, if you can, help out with disaster recovery via donating funds or supplies. I'm sure there can be a LPT about finding reputable charities and/or what's the best thing to donate...but I honestly don't know enough. Best of luck to those in Texas who are dealing with the hurricane.
