YSK about ghostproject.fr, which allows you to check if your password has been leaked similar to haveibeenpwned.com AND it shows you a portion of your leaked password so you can verify which password is compromised

content:
It scans nearly 1 billion credentials that were recently released in a data dump. It's not as up to date as haveibeenpwned but it's still an invaluable resource.

Moving forward, most security experts suggest using some kind of password manager like Dashlane, iCloud keychain, or LastPass so you use a variety of passwords keeping you much more secure.
