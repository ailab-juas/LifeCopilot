title:
YSK that 'follow on/stage 2+' formula milks are not at all necessary for your baby and are a marketing ploy

Why YSK: 

First stage/stage 1/newborn formula is *fine* for your baby up until 12 months and beyond, if you wish. There are little, if any, differences between them and stage 2/follow on milks... The only reason milks such as stage 2/follow on/hungry baby/growing up milks exist is to get around infant formula advertising laws. The law states that you can not advertise first stage formula because it negatively impacts breastfeeding rates, so formula companies get around this by introducing these other formulas, which are totally unnecessary. Don't stress yourself out by switching over at 6 months and beyond, keep doing what you're doing!
