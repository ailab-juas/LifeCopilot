LPT: When comforting someone, don’t jump straight to talking about your experience with something similar. It may make the other person feel worse.

Obviously there are times it’s helpful to be like “I’m sorry X happened to you. I had to deal with X before so I know it can be really hard.” 

However it’s usually better to tell them how sorry your are and that you’re available to talk if they need it. Sometimes they DON’T want to hear about somebody else’s experience because it can feel like you are comparing or invalidating what they are going through. Even worse they will feel like you’re making it about you (even if that’s not what you’re trying to do).

It doesn’t matter what your intention is. What matters is how they feel in the moment and the last thing you want to do to a loved one is make them feel worse.

So be there for them, read the room, and when/if they’re open to talking about it then you can give them a little anecdote to make them feel like they’re not alone (if applicable)
