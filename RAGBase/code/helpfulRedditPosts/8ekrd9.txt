LPT: If you suspect your cat isn't drinking enough water, try using a wider dish. Cats' whiskers are extremely sensitive and the whiskers touching the side of a narrow dish may be irritating to your cat.

Our male cat had a health scare about a year ago: urine crystals. He was having a hard time urinating and was peeing tiny puddles of urine mixed with blood. We took him to a lovely vet who put him on a wet food designed for cats with urinary issues. We were also told that he needed to drink more water, which he'd never been a fan of. 

Tried everything to increase water intake (including purchasing a silly $35 cat water fountain from Amazon) until I finally poked around the internet and saw the whisker tip. Dragged out a wide, shallow pie-dish from the kitchen cabinet that hadn't been used in ages and began using it as the cats' water dish and now I see him drinking water constantly.
