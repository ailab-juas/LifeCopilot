LPT Pay your credit cards off before paying your loans off

content:
Credit cards usually have a higher interest rate, so that's one reason. However, the main reason is because you can still use 70%+ of the money you pay to the credit card in case you're short on other bills. Once you make a payment towards a loan, that money is gone. So, if you pay more than minimum payments on a credit card, you can still use that extra money. If you pay more than minimum to a loan, that money is just gone from you. This will mainly be helpful when you're not absolutely sure you can afford to make an extra payment or if a surprise bill comes up like new tires or something. Also, making more than minimum payments can raise your credit score and the credit institution may increase your card limit, which will also increase your credit score.

Also, keep in mind that you can't pay most bills with most credit cards. So, you'll want to buy things like gas and groceries with the credit card if you won't have enough for the rest of your bills otherwise.
