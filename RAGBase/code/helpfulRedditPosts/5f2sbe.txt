YSK: If you plan on donating clothes to the homeless this winter; do not donate cotton products. Cotton is unable to keep a person warm once wet and actually removes body heat. Donate wool and hemp products instead.

content:
Also if someone is over heating you can put wet cotton on them to cool them off. 

Wool and Synthetics are the best choice for donations.  You will also want to avoid Goose Down and Fleece but those are less likely to extract heat, but still make it difficult to retain heat. 

Bonus: now you know how folks back in the day were able to sustain weather in their wool clothes better than we can today in our cotton.
