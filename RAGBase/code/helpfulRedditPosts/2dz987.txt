LPT: Always leave the address line BLANK while composing an email.

content:
I can't tell you how much grief this has saved me.  Do you ever fire off an email, perhaps to a GF/BF or even a co-worker or boss, and then just wish you hadn't said that?  But in your first rush of love with your own words of poorly-considered emotion, you just craved the satisfaction of pounding that "Send" button?  And now, moments later, you realize you messed up but it's too late?

I don't care *who* I'm planning to email.  Even if it's just routine, I put the address in *after* I'm completely through editing.  That way, when/if I really do want to go ahead and send, I'll have to do at least two steps.  Which gives me extra moments to calm down and think.
