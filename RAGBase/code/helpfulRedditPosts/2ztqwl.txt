title:
YSK that if you're experiencing lower back pain from standing up too long, you can gently squeeze the muscles in your butt to relieve the pain.

content:
By squeezing (contracting, or flexing the muscles of) your butt, you rotate your hips forward out of a position that might have too much [anterior pelvic tilt](http://imgur.com/7KkJYCG). This will flatten your back, and relieve the uneven pressure on your lumbar vertebrae that is likely causing the pain.

This can also help if your experience non-specific knee pain when sitting down, or climbing up stairs. Squeeze your butt before beginning to climb, or sit, and concentrate on maintaining the squeeze throughout.

Source: I'm a total stupid fucktard on the internet that you don't know, and have never met; but seriously try it, the worst thing that will happen is your back and knees will still hurt.

EDIT: When I was referring to pain 'when sitting down,' I meant pain that you experience when moving from a standing to sitting position; so, as you move to sit down. If your knees hurt while you are sitting in a chair, this is not likely to help.

EDIT2: Thanks a lot to all the helpful internet experts who weighed in with more technical information about dealing with lower back pain. I saw a lot of good posts trying to provide what looked like good information to me, but like I said before, I'm no expert. I'm just someone who had this problem and managed to fix it with 'this one weird trick.'

FYI: You can differentiate the people providing good advice from bad, by looking at who's laying out a path that ends with consulting a medical professional. Anyone listing one weird trick after another that doesn't end with going to get evaluated by someone with some paper behind their name, is full of shit.
