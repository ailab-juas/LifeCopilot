LPT: In a windstorm, don't fear the trees that sway, fear the one that doesn't.

I learned this first hand last night. Kept watching out for several trees that I feared were about to be brought down by the hurricane, but it was the big solid oak that failed in the end.

I've heard of this in the past, but it's so counterintuitive that you forget it at the time.
