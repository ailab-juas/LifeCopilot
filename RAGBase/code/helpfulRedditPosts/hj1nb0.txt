YSK showering during a thunderstorm can kill you

content:

Growing up in South Florida, thunderstorms are common in the afternoon, my mom would never let me shower when one was blowing up.  Anyone else mothers used to tell them to not take a shower during a lightning/thunderstorm? This is straight from the CDC

14. Is it safe to take a shower or bath during a lightning storm?
No. Lightning can travel through plumbing. It is best to avoid all water during a lightning storm. Do not shower, bathe, wash dishes, or wash your hands.

10-20 people die each year from this
