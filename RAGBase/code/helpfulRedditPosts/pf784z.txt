Edit: Wow, I didn't expect such a response but that's awesome! So many clever ideas in the comments! Obviously there's no one-size-fits-all approach, but ultimately our goal is all the same; to get kids talking, however way we can. The greatest threat to a child molester is a child who spills the beans. Thanks all!
