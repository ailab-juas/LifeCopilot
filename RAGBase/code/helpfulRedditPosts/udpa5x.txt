YSK that if you experience repetitive, unwanted and disturbing thoughts like "what if I want to hurt someone?" and "what if I'm secretly attracted to children?" it's a symptom of OCD - not of being a bad person

There are lesser-known forms of OCD (usually referred to as Pure O) which manifests itself in the form of repetitive unwanted and disturbing thoughts that goes against what you believe is morally correct. (Also known as intrusive thoughts, different from hearing voices). Many of these are unwanted sexual and violent thoughts. These are distressing and often leaves the sufferer feeling guilty, ashamed, saddened, disgusted or frightened (or a combination of those feelings).

**These are some examples of** [OCD types](https://www.madeofmillions.com/conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder)**:**

* [Harm OCD](https://www.madeofmillions.com/ocd/harm-ocd): concerns you might want to hurt someone (or yourself)
* [Pedophilia OCD](https://www.madeofmillions.com/ocd/pedophilia-ocd): fear you might be attracted to children or harm them
* [Religious OCD](https://www.madeofmillions.com/ocd/religious-ocd): concerns you might do/say something blasphemous, sin, or do something that goes against God
* [Relationship OCD](https://www.madeofmillions.com/ocd/relationship-ocd): constantly second-doubting the relationship, fearing you might cheat, fearing you don't really love your partner...etc
* [Responsibility OCD:](https://www.madeofmillions.com/ocd/responsibility-ocd) fear you might accidentally endager someone, fear that an action you take/don't take might result in harm...etc.

One might have "invisible" compulsions in form of avoidance (e.g. staying away from children, hiding knives), reaassurance seeking (e.g. taking "am I a psychopath" tests or asking people if they think you're a good person), checking (e.g. searching for "evidence" or making sure you have done/haven't done something) or rumination (though there are others, too). Some people experience false memories.

Ironically, these are among the people least likely to harm others because of all the precausions they take not to.

WHY YSK: The reason you should know this, is because there are a lot of people out there suffering from OCD without knowing it. It can be terrifying to walk around with these thoughts. Just know there's a whole community out there who are having the same thoughts and feelings, and there are ways to treat it.

**A video on it**: [What is Pure OCD?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9yKaI0vLJs)

**An excerpt from** [**this**](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/31/pure-ocd-the-naked-truth) **article on a woman's personal experience with it (which might be a bit triggering for some, as it describes thoughts in details):**

&gt;"Purely obsessional OCD is so-called because the compulsions are largely invisible, and not often acted out in the more obvious, better-known ways such as cleaning or hand washing. Pretty much everything about pure O is secretive. These are things you’re not even supposed to think about, let alone talk about. How would a teenage boy tell his parents that he thought about having sex with his sister, a thousand times a day? What if you were a mother and you kept having thoughts about drowning your baby in the bath? Or a gay man who kept having thoughts about vaginas when you made love to your husband? How would you begin to talk about it? You’d keep it secret for years; for your whole life, perhaps."

EDIT: If you feel like this fits you, I recommend looking up OCD further. This is just a quick overview.

Intrusive thoughts are also symptoms of anxiety in general, and could be related to other disorders, too. :)

If these thoughts cause you a lot of distress, I really recommend speaking to a professional.

EDIT 2: I’m happy to see this has been helpful. I’d love to respond to you all, but I am a bit of an anxious person (in part due to my over-inflated sense of responsibility), so forgive me for being a bit shy.

I made this post because I have this myself, and it took me a long time to get diagnosed with OCD because of how scared I was of my own mind. I hope this can encourage people to reach out for help and support, and that it can help you feel better. (It’s possible).

I can’t act as a diagnoser or offer any help beyond my personal experiences, so it’s wise to do your own research on this (and reach out to a professional if possible) if you suspect you’re struggling with this.
