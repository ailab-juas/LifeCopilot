LPT: Now is the best time to go to thrift stores

content:
I run a thrift store and every year the week after Christmas is the best time to shop because people donate their old whatever because they got a new one. (Game systems, Tv's, grills, etc)

They also donate great things from around the house because they want the tax deductible receipt.

They also donate new gifts because they don't want to hurt Uncle Bill or Aunt Linda's feelings about that thing they'll never use.
