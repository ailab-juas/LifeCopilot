LPT: Turning your your headlight on when it's raining is not so much so you can see better, but so other people can see you.

I drive to work on a 2 lane highway where in order to pass someone you have to go into the oncoming traffic lane.  This morning it was raining and ahead of me there was a car who appeared in a hurry and a slow moving truck in front of her.  She decided to pass the truck thinking the oncoming traffic lane was clear.  Well it wasn't.  There was a gray car with no headlights on.  The passing car was in the middle of the truck when she noticed the gray car with no where to go and ended up swerving off the road.  Luckily it appeared no one was hurt but had the gray car had it's headlights on it would have been clear passing was not an option.  

In this instance i think it probably would have been best for the car not to try and pass while it was raining, but the point still stands.  Turn on your dang headlights.  There's no reason not to.
