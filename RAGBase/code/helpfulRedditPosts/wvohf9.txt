LPT: If you pay to put air in your car tires at a gas station, "truck stops" have free air in the back.

content:
Speedway, ~~Buc-ees~~, etc usually have dedicated diesel pumps around back for 18 wheelers. And more often than not, each pump has its own free air line. If there's not a line of trucks waiting on fuel, pull through and air up for free instead of paying $2 for 60 seconds of compressed air around front.

EDIT: Spelling/ Yes, it is obviously a much wiser choice to invest in an air pump than feed a machine quarters, yet there are still people without one, and this is for them. 

Also, as usual, the real LPT is always in the comments. Apparently a few states require compressed air to be free, but you have to ask for it, otherwise it is assumed you are willing to pay for no reason. 
The comment section here is a bountiful treasure trove of free air spots and tricks. Worth a read IMHO. Good stuff. 

P.S. To those who say "a TrUcK CoMpReSsOr is dangerous because they achieve HiGhEr PrEsSuReS" that's not how compressed air works. Just because your car is capable of driving 100 Mph does not mean that is the speed you drive at. If you can't help yourself from overinflating your own tire, that's on you. (My crappy backup $15 compressor I keep in the car will make 110 psi, there is no such thing as a "more dangerous compressor" for a certain tire, just a more capable one.)
