LPT: It's ok to be selfish when it comes to your health right now. Be clear and stern when it comes to the boundaries you need to feel safe.

Edit: Just to clarify for those who seem to be inferring things from this post that are not there: This is in no way a justification for hoarding things or otherwise being rude. 

There are an unfortunately large number of people who are conditioned in one way or another to believe that considering their well being before another's is selfish or otherwise wrong- this post is for those people; not for people looking to justify buying a pallet of toilet paper or the like.
