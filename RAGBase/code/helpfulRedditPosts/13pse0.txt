LPT: Want something on black friday? Buy what you want at Walmart 4 days before.

content:
They have to price match within 7 days. You just waltz on in when it opens and go to customer service and have them do a price adjustment. It works on videogames. I know that form sure. It should work on most everything else. 

Edit:I tested this myself to be sure. This is why it is posted after black friday. It should work on almost any sale. Just figured I'd give you guys the tip to keep in the back of your head for next year.

Edit 2: So from what we have gathered here. Target won't do it and neither will sears. However, Kohls is 14 days, Best buy is 45 days, and Walmart is 30.
