LPT: If you are thinking about getting a kitten, do not get a single kitten, get two.

content:
My good friend and the godmother of our two wonderful kittens suggested this in November when we started talking about a kitten, our first since our sweet baby of 18 years passed a few years ago.  She said, "Getting two cats solves so many problems."  And here they are:

Kittens are demanding and very social creatures whose curiosity is boundless and they have the capacity to destroy things when they are under-stimulated.  This might seem like the lowest hanging fruit for cat fans in the world, but trust me, we really were going to get a single kitten and it would have been a disaster for that cat.  Watching these two kittens play teaches me that we would never have been able to keep up with the stimulatory needs of a single cat.  We are both working and our kids go to school.  This cat would surely have been lonely and bored during the day -- but now -- with two they are both in constant motion and amusement. 

It is the most remarkable and joyful activity to watch them simply playing with each other.  They are both great cuddlers when they visit with out laps, but when we are not devoted to them, they are devoted to one another.

I know this might sound simple or not worth listening to, but the difference in their temperament to the kitten we had for eighteen years is night and day.  We loved that cat but it was no where near as playful or happy as these two.

Yes -- there is a little bit more responsibility with two -- more feeding and cleaning of course.  But there is twice as much joy for us and ten times as much joy for them.  If someone else has already written about this, view my post as simply a celebration of this as a fact.
