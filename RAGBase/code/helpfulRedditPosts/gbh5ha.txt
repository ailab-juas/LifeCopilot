LPT: If you wake up naturally 2 hours or less before your alarm goes off, get up. You are going to feel way more rested and energized than if you slept another hour and let the alarm break your sleep cycle.

It will also be easier to go to sleep early that day.

Edit: I see a lot of people here saying 2 hours is too long, and it might be. But the main point here is that it is better for you to sleep significantly less and wake up naturally than it is to sleep longer and be forced awake in the middle of a sleep cycle. Ever gotten 8+ hour sleep and still felt miserable in the morning and even throughout the day, you got woken up in the middle of a 90 minute sleep cycle - try to avoid it.

TLDR Context to the protip:
Got drunk with friends and went to bed 2 Am. Had to get up at 9. Woke up randomly at 7am and decided fuck it ill stay up. Been feeling great the whole day, even after a night of drinking with 5h sleep.
