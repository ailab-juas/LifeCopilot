LPT: Confidence is self sustaining. Walk around with your head high and a smile on your face, even if you're faking it. Your new-found aura of intrepidity will make people turn their heads to check you out, boosting your confidence until it's no longer a facade.

I'm not sure if you'd consider this a LPT, but I came to this personal conclusion while psychoanalyzing myself and how far I've come since my ex of over 5 years cheated on me last month. I just stopped looking depressed and smiled at people.. this helped me spark up conversations with strangers and meet new people.. which eventually gave me to confidence to talk to random girls, give them my number and ask them out on dates.. idk if it will work for everyone, but for me, it all leads back to holding my head up high, even though it didn't particularly feel it belonged there.
