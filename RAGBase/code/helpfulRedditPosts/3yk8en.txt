YSK you can buy your own cable modem instead of renting it from your ISP. It will usually pay for itself in under a year.

Comcast in my region charges around $8/mo for a modem rental, and you can buy a new one for $70 - or less if you buy used (I saw one of unknown status for $5 at the local thrift store last week).

Motorola Surfboard modems are a safe bet. If you use Comcast/Xfinity, you can check [here](http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/) to verify compatibility before purchasing.

**Your mileage may vary. Check with your ISP if unsure.**

Edit: Added bold to line, above. This doesn't apply to every technology, every ISP, or every configuration in every market. My experience is with Comcast and I use a separate modem and router. If you use Comcast's VoIP phone service (I don't. Ooma FTW), you may not be able to buy your own modem. Check with Comcast.
