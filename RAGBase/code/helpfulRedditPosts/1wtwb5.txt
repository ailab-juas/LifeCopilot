YSK that it IS possible to mute most self-checkout machines at your local grocery store.

content:
Someone pointed out to me the mute button for the self-checkout machines at Kroger today. It's a volume logo underneath the "pay now" button at the bottom of the screen. I personally was OVERJOYED at this discovery because I generally HATED using the checkout machines but still found them to be somewhat convenient when I was only getting just a few items. But now I don't even have to listen to them!!! Hope this is useful for my fellow convenient store luddites!
