LPT If you need to write an lengthy work email, give headings to each paragraphs. It not only helps your readers, it also helps you to organize your thoughts

content:
I have a coworker who does this in smallest emails, it’s so much easier to read. And because I understand instantly what they are relaying and requesting, I respond and act quicker for them. Started doing that myself, and found myself naturally keep the section relevant to what it’s supposed to focus on. Your readers will appreciate this!

Edit: Some responses say that emails shouldn’t be long anyways, good for you that you never have to give HR/payroll detailed on-record explanations on why they are wrong and what they should do to correct things for you :/
