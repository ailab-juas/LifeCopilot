LPT: If you decide to volunteer to give up your seat on an overbooked flight, don't just take the offer. Tell the gate agent "toss in another $200 (or more/less depending on your best judgment), and I'll go for it." They'll almost always say OK, because a willing volunteer is worth it.

Also, if they offer to give you a meal voucher, ask for a day pass to their first class club.  There will be food there anyway, and they'll have nice seating and other amenities.
