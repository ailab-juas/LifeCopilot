LPT: If you boil too much water for tea or coffee, pour it on the sponge in your sink.

content:
After you fill up your cup or press, whatever you use to make your hot drinks, pour any excess water on your kitchen sponge. Bacteria can't survive temperatures over 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and the water will be above that level. It'll kill the bacteria that might be living in the sponge to prevent it from smelling and maybe even last a little longer than usual.


After reading a lot of the comments in this thread, I wrote a comment below but I don't think too many will see it. I'll quote it here:

I want to clarify that I'm not offering a solution to completely sanitize your sponge or prevent it from ever giving you an illness. My suggestion is only meant to keep the sponge in reasonable condition for a bit longer than it might otherwise remain. Over the course of a year, it might save you a few dollars, maybe enough for a couple weeks of lunch or coffee. I thought it would be a good tip to offer since it's taking a situation that might appear to have no use and giving it some sort of purpose that's also extremely easy to carry out. It works for me and I simply wanted to share some advice for people in the hope that they might find it useful as well.

Additionally, I got about a hundred nasty replies suggesting I use the microwave, get a new sponge, use no sponges altogether or that bacteria can live in space. There were kind replies with these points, but too many nasty ones. Like I mentioned, I'm offering a suggestion for what to do with some extra boiling water that'll help keep sponges decent. It's too bad so many of you had to pontificate before you even understood why I wrote this.

- Thank you to those who upvoted, and to those who thanked me for the tip, you're welcome. Take care.
