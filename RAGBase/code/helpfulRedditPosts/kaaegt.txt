LPT: Use the Notes app on your phone to create a comprehensive list of every meal you know how to cook and add every meal you create to it. That way you can reference it at 5 PM when for some reason every human alive has no idea what they want for dinner.

content:
Not recipes, the whole meal. Ex

-Sausage, Rice, and Fruit
-Salmon and Caprese with Sour Dough
-Breakfast for dinner 
-Clam Chowder with sour dough and grapes 
-Brie and bread with fruit salad
Etc etc etc

I’ve been with my wife for 17 year and every night after a long day of work and kids were both driving on the phone sitting there like assholes unable to think of a single thing to get or make for dinner. Was that way for years. Now my meals list is super long so I can just put her on speakerphone and go through 100+ meals she or I can make in a reasonable amount of time, that will feed all four of us, and it just really helps this unending problem. If you want make a separate list for take out or restaurants you like. It really helped me when I sat down and made the list a year or so ago. For some reason at 5 PM I’ve just lost the ability to think critically about my survival.

Edit: Thank you for the kind words, suggestions, and medals everyone. I HIGHLY recommend reading through this comment section there are dozens of amazing hints and tips.
