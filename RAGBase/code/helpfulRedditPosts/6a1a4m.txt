title:
YSK that if you have a power cut in the UK, always call 105 before calling your supplier.

content:
Your supplier likely doesn't supply your neighbours so doesn't know if the issue affects just you or a wider area.
Calling 105 will put you through to the company that manages the wiring in your region and will be able to see if there is a genuine power cut or of it is just your property.
