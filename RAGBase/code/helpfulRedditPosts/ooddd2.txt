LPT: Let people finish their sentences, even if takes them a moment to find a word or thought.

content:
This whole thing may seem silly, but I can be a bit anxious in conversation because of my introverted tendencies. No small talk, straight to the point please. This often led to me trying to finish peoples sentences or thoughts out of sheer impatience, and people start to pick up on that. People felt nervous speaking with me and in a leadership position at my job it wasn't helping with moral or gaining the trust of my employees. 

Lately I've been trying to sit back and let people finish their thoughts and its made myself and my team a lot less anxious.

I'm not sure if I'm the only one who does this, but I thought it could help someone.
