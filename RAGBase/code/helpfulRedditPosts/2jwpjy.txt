LPT: always remember that one huge sign of an intelligent mind is a student mentality.

content:
I see a lot of narcissism on reddit, especially regarding intelligence.  I see posts with (usually) young people complaining about how they're so much smarter than everyone around them, or how it's unfair that they have to deal with idiots, etc...  I want to remind everyone that this type of mentality only demonstrates that you're narcissistic, not intelligent.  Truly intelligent people maintain a "student mentality" throughout their life, as they know that there is something that they can learn from everyone.  You'll miss a lot of lessons and opportunities if you go through the years thinking that you're more intelligent than everyone else, and therefore you don't have to listen to them.  

*Thank you for the gold!
