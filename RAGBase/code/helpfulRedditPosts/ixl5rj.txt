LPT: When sending someone a birthday wish, try to add one or two sentences unique to that person. This will allow her to remember your wishes as one of the best she will get that day because you care

content:
Birthday greetings lose their power with age. We get fewer and fewer of them and most of them are very repetitive. Same phrases, same wishes. Nothing will improve your mood and the day when someone tells you something special for you. Supporting amateur tennis lessons, wishing to read 50 books a year on a kindle, or breaking a life record in the 10 km run. This greatly improves the mood and makes the other person feel better. Plus, it makes the other person feel you care about them. And isn't that the meaning of wishes?
