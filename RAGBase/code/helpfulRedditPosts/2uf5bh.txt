LPT: If you've let your Costco membership expire, don't RENEW it. Get a new one.

content:
My membership expired at the end of last January.  When I eventually went shopping at Costco in March, I renewed my card then at a cashier.

I was surprised today to find that my card expired yesterday (Jan 31).  I complained that I paid for my membership in March, but their position is that "it's like a gym membership."  

So I paid for 12 months in March, but only received 10 months of use.  Had I paid for a NEW card, it would have been the **exact same charge**.

Update (not because you care, just to be fair to Costco):  I called in to "head office" this morning (they were closed over the weekend).  I told the customer service rep the situation.  She said "No problem, I'll set your membership to expire at the end of March."  Done in two minutes.  It's ridiculous that the in-store customer service couldn't provide the same level of service.
