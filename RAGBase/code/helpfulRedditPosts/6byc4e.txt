title:
YSK inflatable arm floaties are ineffective swimming tools and dangerous

content:
I am a lifeguard at a pool, and every so often a parent will come in with their child in separate inflatable arm floaties (puddle jumpers are ok, but still not the best for learning to swim). 

If you have any of these stop using them right now. What can happen is, if your child puts their arms straight up in the air, the floaties will be pushed down to their hands. The child will either be stuck underwater or will slip right out and sink. 

In addition, if they are used, they promote swimming in an upright position which can be a hard habit to break once they start learning to swim  correctly. Do yourself and your child a favor and invest in a floaty that goes on their back, a lifejacket, or literally anything except inflatable arm floaties.
