In the northern hemisphere right now, you can see 3 planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) and there's a comet visible to the naked eye under the big dipper (just over a hands width with your arm extended under the  bottom right star of the big dipper. It looks like a fuzzy patch. It helps me to look right beside it instead of at it. You can see the tail pretty clearly)
