LPT: If you get in a taxi cab and the manual door locks have been unscrewed, GET OUT!

content:
If the manual door locks on a taxi cab look like [this](http://imgur.com/j7iEPIP), you need to refuse the taxi and get out. No good can come of the cabbie locking you in the car.

The cabbie may have done it so people can't run away but, for honest citizens, you are trapped inside his vehicle. If you got in a wreck, you're trapped. If he wants to take advantage of you, you're trapped. If it catches on fire, you're trapped; even the fire department will have a tough time getting you out.

This practice is illegal in most places but it is rarely enforced. Just please refuse the service and find a law abiding taxi.
