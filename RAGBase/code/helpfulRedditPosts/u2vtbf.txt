LPT: .08 BAC is a lot lower than you might think. If you can feel that you’ve been drinking at all, you’re probably too drunk to drive.

I bought a breathalyzer recently out of curiosity, and decided to test it out last night. The results were eye opening, to say the least. 

For me, .08 was a gentle buzz. Nowhere near what I’d consider drunk. I didn’t really feel drunk until I blew a .11, which is a full *40%* above the driving limit in most places. 

Unless you are stone-cold sober, just Uber.
