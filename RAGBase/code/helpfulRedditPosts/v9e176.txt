LPT: By reading 20 pages a day, you can read eighteen 400 page books in a year.

content:
Many people overestimate the amount of effort needed to read a lot of books, but even for slow and unmotivated readers, 20 pages is a relatively small investment. The hardest part is being consistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some math:

20 pages per day x 365 days per year = 7300 pages per year.

7300/1225 = nearly six War And Peace length books.

7300/552 = thirteen The Book Thief length books.

7300/279 = twenty-six Pride And Prejudice length books.

Happy reading!
