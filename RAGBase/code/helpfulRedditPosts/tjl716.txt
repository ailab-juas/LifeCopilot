LPT: Resist the urge to say “I know” when someone is showing you how to do something that you’ve already learned.

content:
Instead, wait for them to finish and exhibit your understanding. You’ll come off as a quick learner, you’ll avoid an annoying interruption, and you’ll also avoid robbing them of the joy people get from sharing knowledge with one another. This has helped me in the past when trying to make a positive impression on instructors, employers, and especially peers.

This obviously isn’t suitable for every exchange involving teaching and learning. Like most tips, it depends on context and could come in handy for a wide range of them. (Don’t sit through a 20 minute lecture if you’ve already learned all the content to it)

Edit1: no this doesn’t mean I think anyone should tolerate a mansplainer.
