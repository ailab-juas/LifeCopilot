LPT: If someone shows you something they are proud of in a subject you don't really care about, just express how happy you are that they are happy.

 Even if you don't care about the subject someone is proud of that they have accomplished something in, just express you're glad they gained happiness from it. People have widely varying interests, and can value much different things in life. This makes them feel fulfilled and like they have done something worthwhile, and who knows, maybe you're the only person they have to show off to. It also takes the burden off you of feeling like you need to be involved in a community/activity you don't necessarily find interesting to be able to encourage them. 

Everybody needs a little validation, and this is a good way to provide it. Also, it'll strengthen that friendship/relationship , and encourage them to do the same for you.

EDIT: Been seeing some comments about how this can sound fake or patronizing, and how it's better to just say "I don't know crap about X, but you definitely have killed it here", and I totally agree with that. Robotically saying 'I'm happy you are happy' is certainly odd ðŸ˜… but you can express your admiration in many ways!

EDIT 2: Lots of people have mentioned great points of going even further by asking poignant questions to learn more, like "what was the hardest part?", or "explain to me about this portion I totally don't get", or even finding something quirky or unusual and pointing it out in a positive way, And I totally love it! The original intention of this post wasn't to stop at a base level of appreciation, so I enjoy all the suggestion or examples given here!
