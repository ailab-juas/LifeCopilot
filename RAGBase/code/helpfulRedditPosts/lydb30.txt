YSK: If you are struggling and below 200% of the poverty level for your family size, pcsforpeople.org sells computer solutions for a reasonable price.

Why YSK: Computers are typically expensive, and with the economic issues challenging the country right now. Having access to a solid computer for school / work purposes can be challenging. A lot of schools went online recently, and people living in underserved communities struggled to provide adequate technology for their child to access their coursework. In addition, having access to a computer would allow those unemployed as a result of the recent global issues to seek employment opportunities from home.

[pcsforpeople.org](https://pcsforpeople.org/) has been around since 1998. They offer computer solutions (tower, monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.) from $0 - $160. You have to provide income verification to prove you are struggling.

[EDIT] They also offer affordable internet access for those that need it. It's $180 a year for high speed internet with no data cap. 

[EDIT 2] Given the amount of people that have asked this question, yes, it is for America only. 

I know what I typed probably reads incoherently. I just wanted to share this with people who may be struggling and also need a computer.
