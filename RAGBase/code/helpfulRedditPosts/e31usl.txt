YSK Stretch marks are an indicator of speed, not size.

content:
Stretch marks happen with rapid growth. I'm 5'4" and never been heavier than 110 lbs, but I have fairly prominent marks on my hips. So if you feel overweight or unhealthy because you have them, don't. They're super common and just mean that part of your body grew fast.
