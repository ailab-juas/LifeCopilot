YSK that if gender dysphoria seems unrealistic to you, it's because you haven't experienced it, not because it doesn't exist.

content:
According to psychiatry.org, gender dysphoria is a conflict between a person's physical gender (assigned gender) and the gender with which they identify.

It's important to remember that something you haven't experienced can seem strange or made up. Don't let how something feels or seems influence whether you believe it's real. 

Gender dysphoria has been a recognized condition for decades. It's experienced by real humans and causes real suffering when left untreated. It's not something that's a kink or a fetish or a wild idea that will go away if you try really hard to forget about it. It happens to real people who need real treatment--it's not something that you can "just get over."
