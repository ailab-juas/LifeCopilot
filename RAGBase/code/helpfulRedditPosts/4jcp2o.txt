LPT: Download Wifi analyzer to determine what channel your router should broadcast its Wifi Signal. Improved my wifi speeds by 22x

content:
I recently moved into a condo and have a 100mbps plan, but my wifi was only getting 4Mbps using Speedtest.

Using Wifi Analyzer showed I was on Channel 6 along with about 6 others.

Channel 11 only one had one other, so I changed my wifi signal to use channel 11. Immediately after I ran Speedtest and got 87Mbps.

Edit: 

Wifi Analyzer for Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&amp;hl=en

For Windows: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/wifi-analyzer/9nblggh33n0n

Sorry iphone/~~Mac~~ people. For Mac Users: (thanks /u/smpx)

Find "Wireless Diagnostics" under utilities (or just use Spotlight to bring it up)

Go to "Window" menu and select "Scan". This shows you the exact same information.

To change your Wifi's channel:

Go to: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1, this is your login page. 192.168.1.254 is for att. 10.0.0.1 is Comcast

By default the login is either admin / admin, or admin / password or admin / [blank]
