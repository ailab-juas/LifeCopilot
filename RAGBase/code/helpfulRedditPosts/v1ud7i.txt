title:
LPT if you are about to be or already are homeless get a gym membership

content:
The gym is a place that you can use to get back on your feet. In addition to getting regular exercise and meeting people, you can bathe there, store your valuables in a locker, wash your clothes in the shower and dry them in the sauna, you can also forage for new clothes from the lost and found bins. It also allows you to retain your dignity, as you have a regular way of being clean and fresh. Most gyms have long hours and unlimited use, so on days of bad weather you can take a free class or do laps in the pool. Most gyms have monthly cash options that are less than $50. You also will have a source of clean water and free energy to charge your devices. I used this method to free myself from homelessness years ago. I hope this helps someone.
