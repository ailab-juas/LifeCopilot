LPT: With winter approaching, if you are stuck in frozen water from cracked ice, lay down on your stomach like a seal to get to safety instead of trying to stand and walk. Laying down on your stomach distributes your weight across a larger surface area than trying to stand

This also goes for seeing someone else stuck in icy water, or if you're trying to rescue someone stuck in the water. Instruct them to lay down on the ice on their stomach like a seal so their weight is spread across the surface area of their entire body instead of just their feet
