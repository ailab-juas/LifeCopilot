LPT: Want to improve your memory? Try the method of loci, used by world-class memory competitors.

content:
How it works: 

1. Think of the layout of an area you are extremely familiar with (such as your house).
2. Assign each small piece of information to a location/object in that area in your mind. Connect each piece of information to the image and/or sensations of that location/object.
3. Commit to memory a very specific "route" through your layout, connecting each of your "stops".
4. When you need to recall the information, visualize yourself walking through your route and stopping at each location/object and "looking" at it.

The more familiar you are with the layout, the easier it is to recall the information you've assigned to it.
