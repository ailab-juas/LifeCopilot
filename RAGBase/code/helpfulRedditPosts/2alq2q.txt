LPT: If you're cutting out a furball out of a long fur pet, use a bobby pin next to the skin so you have a guide on where the fur ends.

I have a squirmy, long furred cat, and this is a great way to know where the fur clump ends and she begins. It's especially helpful when it's under her arms or hind quarters, where she's especially ticklish. That way I don't have to overly worry about accidently clipping her.
