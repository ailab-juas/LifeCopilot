YSK: "If someone has 'GTE' [for "gate"] on their boarding pass, it means they don't have a seat."

content:
&gt;A pair of Air Canada insiders are shedding light on the airline's policy of overselling flights, revealing what they say is a widespread practice of duping passengers into believing they have a seat on a plane and stringing them along until the last possible moment.

N.B. Not sure if 'GTE' is specific to Air Canada or an industry term. I take this to mean if there is no assigned seat number on the boarding pass you are going to hear from the seat nazi - "NO SEAT FOR YOU!".
