LPT: The moment someone you know mentions their birthday immediately add it to your google calendar as a recurring event.

Make sure you time it to 10 minutes before 12am (or whatever time you wish people) so that you have 10 minutes to compose a nice wish for them or a small surprise. I can assure you they will really appreciate this and feel like you care :)
