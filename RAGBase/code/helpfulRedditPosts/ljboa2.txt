LPT (pre-storm shopping): If the store is out of bread, go to the freezer section and get a bag of frozen bread dough. Enjoy fresh-baked bread without any of the work as you wait out the storm.

UPDATE: 
1.) The “hoard all the staple foods when snow is forecast” and leave all the shelves empty appears to be a US southern thing. Maybe it’s just Texas. 
2.) You thaw/bake the bread before the storm...this is PRE-STORM.
3.) Thank you for so much conversation. I forget sometimes what a lively bunch Redditors are.
