This approach is probably only effective with a reputable company, but it is still helpful for others if you leave honest reviews online. 

Recently I was having trouble with a property management company over a minor amount of money.  After a few months they had not corrected the issue or responded to my later inquiries.  The day I left a one star review on Google however, they sent me an apologetic email explaining the issue in depth.
