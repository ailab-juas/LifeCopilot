LPT- New to gardening? Expect to kill a lot of plants, don't let that discourage you.

content:
Any veteran gardener with well established gardens will have killed thousands of plants over the years- Remember, you don't see their failures displayed their gardens- only their successes.    


To put it bluntly, killing plants is part of the learning process of becoming a gardener.  When this happens, don't get discouraged, don't give up.      


Also, maybe buy more cheaper plants until you figure out how to care for them better, knowing that plant death is probably going to happen pretty frequently.
