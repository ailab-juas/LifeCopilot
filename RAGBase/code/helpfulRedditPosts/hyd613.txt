LPT: If you're feeling like your life is of no value to the world, and you are somebody who spends a lot of "me time" and hardly any time with others, you can find meaning in doing nice things for other people, people can and will remember the smallest things you do for them

"Happiness lies at the intersection between meaning and pleasure"

This is a lesson that I have learnt today after spending all weekend feeling incredibly low. I've spent over two years now purely focused on me and my happiness rather than others. A lot of this time has been more distractions than anything. Over time what I think has happened is that because I've spend little to no time doing nice things for others and not feeling appreciated by others, because I'm not helping, I've slowly begun to feel like my life is useless. You want to feel useful? Go do something kind for your neighbour, read their kids a book, buy the parents a food they like, help them fix something if you're handy. People will appreciate your help, and that makes them feel good, which makes you feel good. That positive energy you're spreading never dies. I still remember 14 years ago being 6 years old and my elderly neighbour babysitting me, he taught me how to flip a coin, that's it. And that's something that has stuck with me all these years and a fond memory of mine.
