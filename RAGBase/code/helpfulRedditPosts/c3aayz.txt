YSK that sleeping more isn't always better (and I'm not talking about oversleeping)

content:
There are around 1.5 hour long sleep cycles that our body goes through, each consisting of 4 phases, the last phase being the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) or dreaming phase. On average, we sleep through 5 cycles at night (hence 7.5 hours). The first two phases result in a light sleep while the other 2 are phases of deep sleep.

The important thing is that waking up during the second half of a sleep cycle (in the last 2 phases) disrupts deep sleep, and leaves you tired and groggy. Thus, for eg. if you have just 3 hours of time left to sleep, consider delaying sleep for another hour and setting an alarm for 2 hours, so that you don't wake up in the middle of a deep phase of the second cycle, and instead wake up in a lighter phase.

It's also the reason why it is advised to take short naps of around 25-30 minutes rather than an hour long nap.

TL;DR : We oscillate through periods of light and deep sleep. Waking up during a deep sleep phase feels awful.

Edit:

I never said sleeping less is a good advice. I know people need 4-6 sleep cycles to get enough rest to work properly. Also that the sleep cycles are dynamic and the duration may vary slightly from person to person.

Also, this may not be very helpful for those for whom the time you take to actually sleep might varies drastically, i.e. you may take just 5 minutes to fall asleep on one day and maybe an hour on the other. I am just pointing out a bodily fact which might be helpful to some people. I am not a sleep specialist either.
