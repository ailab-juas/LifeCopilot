LPT: Don't make fun of people for how they look. Nobody has any control over the genetic hand they were dealt.

content:
When I was a kid, I remember thinking jokes about how people looked were funny. As I got older, it really struck me how little choice people have in the attributes that get ridiculed by others. No one chooses the size of their ears, the alignment of their eyes, the shape of their jawline, the form of their bodies, etc. Not only is it unnecessarily cruel to mock someone for something no one could control anyway, it paints the teaser as an idiot for being mean nonetheless.
