LPT: Get the originals over low-fat versions of food. After taking out the fat, food tastes terrible, so the companies pump it full of sugar to make up for it. Sugar contributes more to weight gain than fat does.

I'm referring mainly to America here as most int'l nations likely have more clear packaging and branding, but I can't say for sure

Edit: Not all products are like this. Always be sure to check the label.

Edit 2: Skim milk is not like this.

Edit 3: for those of you saying "Calories are all that matters" and "fat has more calories than sugar", you should know that not all calories are processed the same. Google "why a calorie is not a calorie".
