LPT: put in time and effort to learn how to drive to maximise your passengers comfort. When driving work colleagues/family/partner/friends etc. you want to prioritise making them feel safe and comfortable. Its completely different being in the passenger seat with zero control, factor this in.

When driving on your own, do your own thing, but things like driving too close, harsh breaking and heavy steering can cause anxiety to your passengers. The last thing you want to do is make a co worker feel unsafe or to make a relative jolt about the car.
