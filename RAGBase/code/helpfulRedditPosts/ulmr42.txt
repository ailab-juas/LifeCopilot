YSK: Hangovers and high altitudes are an unpleasant combination.

Why YSK: To save you from unexpectedly awful hangovers. 

Whilst your body is acclimating to higher altitudes hangovers and altitude sickness stack. The same amount of alcohol won't get you drunker, but you might end up feeling bloody terrible in the morning. Drink lots of water before bed and maybe ease up on the booze for the first few days if you're holidaying somewhere high up, I wish I'd known this a few days ago.
