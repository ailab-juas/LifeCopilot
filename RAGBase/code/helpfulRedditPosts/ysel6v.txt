LPT: If you are dealing with a collections agency, put the onus on them to prove you owe the requested money.

content:
A few years ago I had Yellow Pages contact me saying I owed a $399.00 invoice that I was unaware of. I disputed the invoice on the phone, through email, and through regular mail. After six months I stopped receiving these notices, thought it was resolved.

A few months later I received the same invoice but from a different mailing address, it was located somewhere in Arkansas. I threw it away, but then they started calling monthly. After arguing with them for a couple of months, I told them that I would pay them if they could prove that I owed the money. This seemed to stop them in their tracks; I told them they would not get a dime from me unless they could prove with physical paperwork that I had agreed to this service in the first place. I told them that I would pay in full immediately if they would send me such proof, but they were wasting postage and time if there was anything short of that.

I received one more form letter demanding payment, but no more harassment since then.
