YSK It is cheaper to buy an espresso machine and ship coffee from Italy than it is to buy a lattes continuously

[Decent Basic Espresso Machine](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Briel-RETRO-ES14-Pink-GIRLY-MINI-Espresso-Machine-110-220v-Made-in-Portugal/192836290672?hash=item2ce5f04870:g:tHkAAOSwYvFZLtfL) - $239 


[Half kilo of ground Italian Coffee (Brand I drank while living there)](https://musetti.us/product/espresso-2x250-gr-2x8-8-oz-ground/) - $27

 (Half Kilo is about month supply, assuming 4 espresso shots per day)



Total -$239 + ($27 * 12 months)= **($563/year)** 

Buy Coffee - Assume Average price of $4.75 for Latte and
360 days of consumption/year

**1/day consumption
$4.75 * 360 = $1710 per year**

**2/day consumption
2* $4.75 * 360 = $3420 per year**

You could buy a whole damn vacation with that $1,147 in savings.

**Edit:** So many people are telling me I forgot Milk and Syrup costs.

You can get a 750ml bottle of Torani from Walmart for like $11. Assuming 1 month to go through it, it would add about $121 extra per year to do it

Milk can be bought for as cheap as $2.28 a gallon at the Supermarket.

Assuming a week to finish a gallon of milk, that would add like $118.56 to the yearly costs.

In total, that is about $240 extra per year (total cost of $803). Still profiting though.
