LPT: If you like buying lottery tickets, start buying cheap stocks instead. It still has the thrill of gambling, the game lasts a lot longer, and the odds of making a million are much much much much much more in your favor mathematically speaking.

Wow!  Thank you for all the awards!  Let me take a moment to address some of the more prevalent comments:

1. Yes, I typed 'stocks' , not socks.

2. I did NOT type 'penny stocks'.

3. I am not giving financial advice, my only goal with this LPT is to alert people to the idea that gambling money can be spent on an appreciating asset, and it still feels fun.

4. The math.  Simply put, if you invest $35, make a 35% gain, 35 times reinvested, you are a millionaire.  Not every stock will win, but selecting 35 winners beats the 300,000,000 : 1 odds of the lottery by leaps and bounds.
