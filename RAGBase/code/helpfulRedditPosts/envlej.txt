LPT: If you feel without purpose and excitement in life, start learning new things

content:
I am writing this because I know there is lot of people, especially males in 20y-30y (like me) who struggle with finding meaning of their life and feel often kinda bored/nihilistics/useless and don't really have motivation to think positive about their life. I know this will sound absolutely simple and obvious but it helped me A LOT and while it is always ongoing process I invite you to really try this:

LEARN A NEW HOBBY OR SKILL - no matter how silly or hard it seems, go for it. More unique, the better. For example I picked up inline skating even though I always sucked on ice skates. None of my friends skated. But I was curious about it, started working on it and hey, I might be not the best skater in the world but I love it and it fills my head a lot thinking about it. It is something I look forward to and if I would start obssesing about some negative thoughs, I redirect myself into obsessing about my skates - how could I get better, more unique, cool?

And you know the best thing about learning new hobby? You will meet similary passionate people and they even can become your friends. Because you can talk about your hobby first and it won't be awkard but smooth as silk. 

You will naturally get confidence from this because if you managed to get better at something you sucked at first, why couldn't you improve something else in your life? Well you can and there is more in you then you think.

And for inspiration, if there are people who learned something new recently, what was it?
