YSK there's a free alternative to Wolfram Alpha called fxSolver for solving Math and Engineering problems

content:
It has a large library of equations to solve, plot and link together and each one can be customized and shared.

It's not a behemoth knowledge engine like Wolfram, but it's very useful for getting quick results by finding the right formula and solving it for any variable.

Anyway, [here's the link.](https://www.fxsolver.com)
