LPT: Picking up people at the airport? Have them meet you at Departures instead of Arrivals

content:
Traffic is much lighter and moves much more quickly in the Departures area compared to Arrivals. All it takes is a couple minutes to go back upstairs (usually) and you can pick them up within minutes while everyone in the Arrivals area slogs through the traffic.
