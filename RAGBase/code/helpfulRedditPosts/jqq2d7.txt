YSK that whenever you have a job interview you should always thank the employer for the interview after it's over, regardless of how it went.

Why YSK: I once had a job interview and I thought it didn't go well, but I emailed the employer after anyways just to thank them for the opportunity. When they got back to me they said that I got the job, partly because I was the only one to thank them for the interview. You should always do this even if you think it's pointless.
