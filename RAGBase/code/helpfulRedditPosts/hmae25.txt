LPT: When moving, pack an "open this first" box of the necessities you will need for a day or two while everything is packed (suggestions in the text, below).

content:
What I recommend for the Open First box:

- One towel for every person living in the house or per bathroom (whichever is more).
- One roll of toilet paper for each bathroom
- One pot (can be used to boil water as well as prepare food)
- One pan
- Corkscrew and/or bottle opener
- Can opener
- What you need to make coffee in the morning, you can get by usually with good instant or a Melitta-style cone to make pour-over coffee into whatever.
- A sharp knife for food prep
- A pair of scissors (more that one if you use bins secured with zip ties)
- One box-cutter per person who will unpack (if you use regular boxes)
- Phone charger
- Trash bags
- Shower curtain and rings (unless it's really skanky, otherwise, you can throw it away as soon as you get a new one, remember you would be showering the next day with it anyway)


Optional:

- If you're eco-conscious, a plate, bowl, water glass, mug, and place-setting per person
- Trash can
- Curtains and a tension rod for the bedroom if there are no window treatments.
- A fan if you are going somewhere in the summer and the AC needs to be set-up
- Two screwdrivers, flat and Philips head, duct tape, and WD-40

Also, have a separate box for first-day bedding with a sheet (plus a top sheet if you use it), blanket, and pillow(s).

EDIT: Great suggestions for additions, I am adding them as I see them.
