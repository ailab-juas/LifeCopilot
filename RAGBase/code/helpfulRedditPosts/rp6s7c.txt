LPT : “Tell me about your day” will often get a better response than “how was your day?”

content:
Not only that, it shows more genuine interest to the receiver. This can also be applied to other subjects like trips, projects, new job, etc.

Edit : There seems to be a descent amount of negative comments revolving around manipulation.
To hopefully clear this up, know your audience. This isn’t meant for every age, personality type, situation etc.

Edit 2 : “I would love to hear about your day”, if the advice seems too direct. It might feel uncomfortable but that’s what growth feels like.
