title:
YSK you don't need to have a physical problem to get assistance at places like airports

content:
Any major place that moves people around, such as an airport, has assistance programs to help people who struggle to get around easily. Normally we think of them as being there for the elderly or those with physical problems such as crutches/wheelchairs. However, you can go to them for any reason why you need assistance - if you're feeling unwell, if you have anxiety attacks, if you're confused and lost. The people working there would much rather help you have a positive experience than have to deal with a meltdown or medical problem! **It's okay to ask for help even if it's not an emergency. It's better to ask for help before the problem gets to a point where it impairs you.**

Pro tip: If you know a particular area is likely to cause problems (e.g. crowds and queues triggering panic attacks), email in advance so they can make arrangements with you to get through everything smoothly.

Bonus pro tip: Get names/badge numbers when you can and email your thanks to the airports and airlines afterwards. Compassion and kindness deserve recognition!
