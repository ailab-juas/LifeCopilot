LPT: after a breakup, never complain or bitch out your ex to family members.

content:
In case of reconciliation and getting back together, it becomes very difficult to regain the approval from parents/siblings. They just want what's best for you and tend to not be so thrilled to hear you are back together with someone who has mistreated and hurt you. There's two sides to every story.
