LPT: Before you get up from your desk, write a note with the first task you need to do when you return so that you can keep yourself on track.

I find this to be especially helpful when working on a large project (I'm currently working on a 100,000-word thesis). When I get back to my desk after a break or distraction, having the note helps me get back on track more quickly. Getting back to work and seeing a note that says "Edit section 3.2 to make it flow better" is more helpful than returning to my desk and thinking "time to work on my thesis."
