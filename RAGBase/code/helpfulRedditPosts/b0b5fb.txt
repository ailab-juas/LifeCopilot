LPT: If you find you keep apologizing due to anxiety, try replacing ‘sorry’ with ‘thank you’

content:
I have pretty severe anxiety. I once counted the times I said sorry for a week and I averaged almost 40 times a day.

I’ve been trying to switch those anxiety apologies to saying thank you.

Instead of saying something like “Sorry for being so annoying and a bother.”

I’ll say “Thank you for having patience with me and giving me the opportunity to organize and present my thoughts.” 

My bosses have said they can see how I seem happier at work. 

I hope this helps someone. Thank you for reading!
