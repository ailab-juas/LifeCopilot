Last night someone I’ve volunteered with on-and-off for 2 years, I’m pretty sure forgot my name, so I worked into conversation said something like *“I have a tendency to leave things till the last minute, and my roommate is like ‘Alybank! Why are you like this?”* I could see the relief on the other persons face when I said it.
