LPT: Know someone who has lost a loved one? Make sure they have plans the day AFTER the funeral. That day is beyond tough.

content:
Everything leading up to the funeral is people contacting you, visiting you, making sure you're ok. And then the day of the funeral, you are surrounded by people who love you, care about you, etc. But then the funeral is over, and people think you just need time alone. NO. THIS is the time to make plans. Take them out to lunch, watch a movie together, go hiking, anything. It will mean the world to them.

EDIT: Some really helpful tips and advice in the comments! Thank you so much for the awards, too.
