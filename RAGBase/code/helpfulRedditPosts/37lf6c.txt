title:
LPT: Make a Running List of your Accomplishments at Work to Argue for Higher Pay

content:
For the past year, I wrote down every instance in which I went the extra mile. Overtime hours, weekend work, special projects, customer compliments, etc. 

I was able to make some very strong points as to why I deserve a higher wage increase, given my loyalty and service to the company, without sounding threatening. It also shows preparedness in the negotiation process.

I realize that not all jobs, much less your employee review processes, function as mine does.







Edit: Yes. It works for resumes too. I have been informed.

Edit 2: It would appear I've made a lot of people angry.

Edit 3, for those who subscribe to the more commonplace, aggressive form of the word "argue", I meant it in this sense:

ärɡyo͞o/
verb

give reasons or cite evidence in support of an idea, action, or theory, typically with the aim of persuading others to share one's view.
