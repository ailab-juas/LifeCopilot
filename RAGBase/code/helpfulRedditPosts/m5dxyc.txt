YSK 'Food pranks' aren't pranks. They are felony food tampering offences, grievous bodily harm and assault, and often carry minimum sentences.

Why YSK: Its very easy to ruin your life in various ways, but a lot of possibly younger people here seem to think its a very minor thing.

Intentionally forcing things into other peoples bodies, through deception or force, its extremely serious. Your intention is irrelevant. Warped humour under the misguided idea of what a prank is does not exempt you from interfering with another citizens bodily autonomy.

I saw a post here wherein a youtuber feeding a homeless man toothpaste filled oreos was given 15 months prison and a criminal record for the rest of his life, and people were saying its too harsh.

Uhh, no, its actually lenient for that kind of offence. Food tampering is very serious.
