LPT If you, for whatever reason, need to get rid of dirty needles at home, an empty laundry detergent bottle is an FDA approved option for home disposal.

content:
I just saw a community trash pickup that found many discarded contaminated sharps (dirty needles). This is very dangerous for everyone involved.

The are many reasons you may be producing contaminated sharps at home, but you can do it in a way that poses minimal danger to other people

1. Rinse out an old detergent bottle.

2. Clearly label the bottle as "CONTAMINATED SHARPS"

3. Store the bottle upright at all times and keep the lid screwed on when not in use.

4. Use only until the bottle is about 3/4 full.

5. Before final disposal, screw the lid on tightly and secure it with heavy duty tape like duct tape.
