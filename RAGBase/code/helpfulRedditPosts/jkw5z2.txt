LPT For extremely inexpensive spices of high quality, go to your local Indian grocery store.

content:
Buying cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, cinnamon, peppercorns, bay leaves, and other powdered spices at your local grocery store can run you $4-7 per 50-60 grams. In my area, cumin is about $5 for a 53 gram bottle of McCormick, and even more for store brand organic.

At my local Indian grocery store, I can buy a 400g bag for $3.

I've now started buying any and all spices that I can at that store.

I also pick up some samosas while I'm there, because samosas are delicious.
