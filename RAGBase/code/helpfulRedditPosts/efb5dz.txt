LPT: Add a site's name after your Gmail address to track who's selling your data. Eg: registering with john.doe+amazon@gmail.com sends all email to John.doe@gmail.com This way when you get spam, look at the 'to' in the email, it should have john.doe+amazon@gmail.com, revealing Amazon sold your data
