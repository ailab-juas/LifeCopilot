LPT: if someone is telling you a story that they've told you before, just say "ah yeah you were saying" and it's a very casual reminder to them. They'll usually say "ah yeah" and continue with something else. It also reassures them that you pay attention to their stories.

I started doing this a long time ago and it's always a very nice casual reminder, they usually just say "ah yeah" and basically skip to the end of the story or switch topics entirely. Just a nice way to keep the conversation flowing and doesnt make people feel like you're being rude or feel annoyed with them. I've worked with a few chronic repeat story tellers and it always works. I've even had a friend say it to me, and I just continued to the next thing after remembering that I did tell them that once before.
