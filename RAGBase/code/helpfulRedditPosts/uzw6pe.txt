YSK that you can get free stuff, make money, and protect the environment during college move out season!

content:
Right now college kids around the US are all moving back home for the summer, or moving permanently. Many of them cant bring belongings with them, so they end up dumping food, clothes, furniture and more in nearby dumpsters.

Why YSK: You can make bank!!! Sure lots of what they dump is gross trash, but you would be surprised at the treasures you can find in and around the dorm/apartment dumpsters. My friends and I have found fancy clothes (Ie Canada Goose jackets, nice bags), kitchenware (Cuisinart and kitchen-aid brand appliances etc), jewelry, electronics, and lots of edible, unopened food (canned goods, spices, bulk dry goods).

It's a great treasure hunt, and you can sell things you don't need online to make some cash. By taking these items, you are reducing the amount of material in land fills and cutting down unnecessary waste while scoring awesome finds and saving lots of money. Once you get good at it and know the good spots you can make $1,000-4,000 by selling the nicer items you find, especially if you live near a college with wealthier students.

Best of luck on your hunt!
