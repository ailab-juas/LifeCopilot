Anyone can do this. No chemistry background needed. Best instructions: http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27089

I know that a lot of fellow redditors like to "experiment" with coke. You should know that you're putting your life in your drug dealer's hands everytime you snort, smoke, or shoot cocaine.

I hope everyone realizes thats I am not advocating drug use at all. I was addicted to cocaine for 6 years... Kinda like this guy...

I was sober off everything for 15 months but now drink occasionally. I sold coke for a number of years and I know what a lot of dealers do to batches.

Long story short... At best you're getting 50% cocaine. You Should Know that whoever you bought it from, and who they bought it from, and so on down the manufacturing line, adulterated the drug to increase the quantity of the substance. 

To the bones of it...

I think that if you are going to make the decision to do cocaine you should eliminate the impurities. I'll give you five good reasons.

1. You've never done this... Why wouldn't you want to try pure cocaine?

2. You're already doing something unnatural to your body... You don't need to add whatever your dealer threw into the mix.

3. You will do less cocaine... (I did)

4. You will find out what kind of a person your dealer really is... If you get nipped and decide to re-weigh after you clean it, that is.

5. You can help other people that do coke. 

Number 5 is the most important... Some may think it's not a big deal but I think that if people are going to do coke, they should at least do JUST coke... I want all of y'all to be safe... I love every redditor out there... Even the haters.
