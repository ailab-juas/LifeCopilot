LPT: Before checking in at the airport, take a photograph of your luggage. A picture is worth a thousand words if your bags get lost!

This has saved me a few times... If your bags become lost it is very easy to simply show the baggage claims representative a picture of your luggage on your phone rather than try to describe it, *especially* when there is a language barrier.

Edit: My first post to Reddit and it somehow made it to the front page! Thanks all!
