LPT: The ability to rely on your coworkers to do their jobs is invaluable. If you routinely have to do extra work because of someone else, do NOT wait for a superior to notice. Bring it up with the person and offer to help. If they still won't fix themselves, bring it up with a superior.

If your superior doesn't want to take action, you may have leverage to create a managerial position for yourself or at least to ask for a raise.

If you can't get a raise for the extra work your doing and no action is taken, try to find a new job.  You deserve better than to be a doormat.
