LPT as you get older, do your best to get used to being taught things by people younger than you, respecting them for their knowledge. don't condescend because of their age or take it as a hit to your own ego.

I'm almost 30 it's getting to the point where I'm getting older and I'm still learning.

For example I'm taking voice lessons from someone who's about 10 years younger than me.

I remember how my parents acted when being taught something, or shown something, they would just write it off as something the "kids" can deal with, and unimportant.

I'm doing my best not to do this to other people as I grow up as it leaves the older person unable to function, and the younger person frustrated enough to want to jump through a window.
