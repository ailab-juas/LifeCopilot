title:
YSK about the Mud Dauber Wasp, a solitary friend that keeps your space free of spiders

content:
Why YSK: despite looking intimidating, Mud Daubers are solitary and not aggressive unless provoked. They can be seen flying around garages, barns, and other structures. They build mud nests and kill spiders for food. They’re the main predator of the Black Widow spider. Don’t kill them! Personally, I’d rather have a docile wasp bro hanging around than a bunch of spiders.
