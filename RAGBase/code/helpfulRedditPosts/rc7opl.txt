title:
LPT: when interviewing for a job, YES, you always have another offer in the works

content:
When the interviewer asks "have you had any recent interviews or offers?" the answer is always a polite, measured version of 'yes'.

'Well, I did just have my second round interview with (their direct competitor), but no formal offer at present. I know the holidays slow things down a bit.'

If you say you have no other offers, there is no impetus to hire you, bump you up a pay grade, treat you like a human, etc. Besides which, everyone has competition... except fucking North Korea.
