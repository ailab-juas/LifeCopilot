YSK: If you use Google voice commands on your phone, you may be surprised what data is being kept without your knowledge

content:
I've just discovered months of random voice recordings that Google has kept, where it "thinks" I am activating the voice commands. Check out https://myactivity.google.com and look at Voice &amp; Audio Activity.

A lot of the recordings seem to start before I had said "Ok Google", which suggests it is potentially recording all the time. Check through your privacy settings and disable the options to keep recordings.
