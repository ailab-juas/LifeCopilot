LPT if you have to give your email to a company, use the company’s name as your listed first name. That way if they sell your information to third parties, the spam emails will be auto-filled with the original company’s name instead of your own so you know who sold your info.

Obviously only do this with unimportant accounts and only if your name isn’t important for legal reasons, but I’ve done this for apps, conferences, demos, etc. Just recently I got spam email that said “Dear XYZ App Trial, don’t miss out in these deals!” - so I knew XYZ App sold the data.

Edit: To those asking what you can do, if a company sells your data without your permission you can file a formal complaint with the FTC here: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2015/08/want-privacy-tell-us-about-it

2nd Edit: I've been made aware in the comments that others have had this idea and posted it to the sub before and that I'm an idiot. My apologies for not knowing that, I hope I didn't ruin anyone's evening too badly.
