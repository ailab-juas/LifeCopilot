LPT: How to increase your reading speed

content:
Most people read using the speed of their regular talking voice. To improve your speed count in your head one-two-three-four over and over. This will increase your reading speed and after a while you wont have to count in your head while reading.

Edit: To clarify, you should still be ~~reading~~ comprehending the words, however instead of "sounding" the words inside your head you should count 1,2,3,4 over and over in your head. It will take a little practice.

Edit2: if you are not absorbing information using this technique then that means you are counting too fast. Slow down the count and find a balance between comprehension and speed.
