YSK how to call 911 and how to be a good "reporting party."

content:
Almost everyone has to call emergency services at some point in his/her life. It could be that you watched your poor, sweet Nana fall, or you could be behind an erratic driver, or your neighbors might be beating the shit out of one another, or, perhaps, you're experiencing chest pains. 

I know the feeling--that "I can't believe I'm doing this" thought as you dial those three numbers. 9. 1. 1. I have been on both ends of that line. 

Here's (**basically**) how it works: 

We're trained to ask questions--the right questions--to get the information we need. If nothing else, we only want one single piece of information: "what's your location?"

So, before you even hit talk, you should know where you are. The address of the house, the names of cross streets, the mile post, the direction of travel, etc. We can't do anything if we don't know where you are. 

No, your exact cell location doesn't map automatically (nine times out of ten we get the plot of the nearest tower. We can retransmit the call to triangulate your location, but even that is imprecise and almost completely useless). 

No, I cannot "enhance" my way to a picture of you standing on a street corner. 

Some places separate dispatch by function: do you need police, fire, or medical aid? In other cases, like my Center, we do it all. Not only am I talking to you, I'm dispatching police to a Domestic Violence call, status checking my officer on a traffic stop, pulling a warrant for another dispatcher, and giving the additional to the ambulance en route to a vehicle accident. 

**Be ready to answer the questions we ask.**

It's not that we don't care that you saw the same car drive by ten minutes ago and it seemed suspicious, or that it's the first time it's happened in 27 years that someone turned around in your driveway--it's just that we can't do much with that information. 

We ask what we need to know. Answer, and then sit tight. 

Be as observant as you can when you're reporting a police matter. 

You witnessed something involving a vehicle?

 We're going to want to know the CYMBAL of the car (**C**olor, **Y**ear, **M**odel, **B**ody, **A**lterations/**A**dditional, and **L**icense). We're going to want to know direction of travel, what it is doing, where it was last seen...

People: 

Be ready with race (Yes, it feels weird to ask. Yes, I ask "was he a white male?"), age, height and weight, and clothing. We're looking for specifics--top to bottom, outside to in. "He was a white male, about 35, wearing a flat-brimmed ball cap with a sticker, varsity jacket, gray tank, black sweatpants and flip-fops" is excellent. "I don't know" or "I couldn't guess," doesn't help. It's OK if you didn't see--but if you did, be clear and forthcoming. We'll ask you the questions to get you there. 

Here is the biggest life/death scenario game-changer: 

Don't lie. Period. This is especially, insanely, HUGELY important when it comes to drug abuse. 

No, I don't care that you use heroin. No, you're not going to get in trouble for using. No, it isn't illegal to be an addict. 

**But for the love of all that is holy, if I ask you if anyone has used drugs or alcohol, answer me honestly.** 

I am going to ask if the person is conscious. If you say "no," that's OK. I'm then going to ask "is the person breathing *normally.*" "Normally" is the key. I mean it just the way it sounds. Is the person breathing regularly?--you KNOW what normal breathing sounds like. 

Those two questions screen for cardiac arrest. If the person is not breathing normally and not conscious, we're going to start CPR. 

I'm trained to tell you what to do. Don't be afraid. Listen to me--we've got this. 

Here's the crux of everything: your worst moment is something that slips past our radar in the blink of an eye. What you're going through now, we go through all day, every day. Does that sound callous? The same questions I ask about the man shouting to himself on a street corner work just as well if I have to ask someone to describe a school shooter. 

Unconscious and not breathing normally mean the same thing every time, whether it's in a nursing home or the hobo you just passed on the street--this IS cardiac arrest. 

Here's how you can be a good "RP" or "reporting party:"

1. KNOW YOUR LOCATION/Know where the incident took place if you've left the scene. This is how I get the right help to the right place. Even if all I get is someone screaming an address, well, I have enough to rain help down on that location like my officers are a goddamned plague of locusts.

2. Be observant. I'm going to ask you questions about what happened and what you've seen. I don't have eyes and ears where you are. You are now part of me--an extension of my senses. I can't see what you're seeing. I can't here what you're hearing. I can't smell what you're smelling (especially important when it comes to smoke investigations). You are going to have to tell me. I can't tell you to go out there and risk your neck, but I am going to ask literally everything I can of you. 

3. **LISTEN TO ME.** Stop talking and listen. Stress makes you ramble. Let me guide you--I promise we'll get enough information to get stuff started. No, I promise that I don't mean to miss the details, but I will get to them later. Remember that I'm not just talking to you. Any lull in the conversation is me talking on the radio. Please forgive me if I ask you to repeat information (I know I asked for you to confirm your phone number, but at the same time a Deputy called out on traffic and I had to focus on the license plate!). **Let me lead.**

4. The instructions I am allowed to give you are limited--and they should be! I can give you pre-arrival instructions for a medical aid call--these are standardized and specialized responses to what you need. It could be as simple as "gather patient meds and be ready for the ambulance crew" and as advanced as "we need to help the heart work. I need you to get him flat on his back on the floor" (that's how CPR sounds, BTW). As for other matters? I can't really tell you what to do. If you think there's someone outside trying to get in and you ask me what to do I will say "do what makes you feel safe." I will also ask if your doors and windows are locked (hint hint--play it safe, kids!), and if you are armed (this is VITAL for officer safety). If you're being followed in a road rage incident--"Do what makes you feel safe." 

THINGS TO REMEMBER: 

1. I am not the officer who will be at your doorstep, but I will be in his ear every second of the way.

2. I am not the EMT that is being dispatched to your location, but my voice boomed through the fire department and woke him up to get him there. He's tired. I'm tired. We're still here to help. 

3. I am not the firefighter who will run into your burning house to retrieve your labradoodle. But I am there waiting for her to come out safe and sound. 

4. I am not the chaplain sent to comfort you, but I am the one who called him and told him "I'm so sorry. It's a SIDS call." 

5. I'm not the one who will be there with you every step of the way. I had to hang up and answer another call and be there for another life to change. 

6. We do this because we love it. That doesn't make it easy.
