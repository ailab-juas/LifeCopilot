LPT: unfollowing celebrities, companies, and people you don't actually know will do wonders for your mental health. no, you will not miss anything. if it's something so important that you should know then it will find its way to you.

i did this some time last year and ever since i've been feeling much better about myself. my confidence has improved and the best part is that on my feed and timeline i see people i actually know! it turned social media back into what it was meant to be; a way to connect with friends and family. it can still be that, you just have to make it be that way.
