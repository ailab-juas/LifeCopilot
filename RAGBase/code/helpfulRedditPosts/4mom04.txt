title:
LPT: Line a measuring cup with plastic wrap when measuring sticky ingredients

content:
If you need to measure out an ingredient, like peanut butter, that is difficult to scoop out of a measuring cup, put plastic wrap loosely over the measuring cup and let it serve as a liner. The wrap will lift easily out of the measuring cup, and the peanut butter (or whatever) won't stick to it.
