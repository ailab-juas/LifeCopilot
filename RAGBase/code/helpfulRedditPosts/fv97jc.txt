LPT If someone tells you they'll off themselves if you leave the relationship, offer professional help and leave

content:
This is a telltale sign of a relationship that's going to be doomed down the line anyway. I've heard this happen to too many people that I know and have seen it posted way too many times online.

You are your own person and should not mistake your own love and affection for someone else as a reason to compromise your own health and safety. If someone threatens you with this line, offer professional help and say that you are doing best for both of you in the long run. Someone's else's life should not be the deciding factor in you finding your own happiness.
