YSK that people with skin conditions are not necessarily unhygienic.

content:

I cant emphasize this enough, i truly hope more people can see this because it is a very serious issue, everyday, someone is committing suicide due to negative remarks made by others, who sometimes dont even know that their remarks hurt.

Instead of judging others with skin conditions like acne, eczema and thinking that they do not take care of their skin or that they are dirty, you should pay less attention to their skin condition and treat them normally.

Trust me when i say this, it might seem like a harmless comment to ask,"Do you even wash your face?" Or "i recommend you to use a mask/drink more water etc." but it is very, VERY hurtful to the person and he/she might recall those exact words and feel like shit from time to time. It bothers the person and it hurts a lot. You will never know the feeling if you lived your life having perfect skin.

People with skin conditions are already insecure about how they look and constantly look for many methods to treat their condition, but it all boils down to genetics/hormones for some people which they have no control over, especially males who cant simply take pills. They do not like your advice/your comments because theyve done everything they could. They probably know more about how to care for their skin than you.

💎Key lesson💎
*Practice having social intelligence, treat the person normally and appreciate them, do not simply judge especially if you havent experienced their conditions personally. Learn how to truly empathize.
This is a very important skill which makes other people like you more.
This doesnt only apply for skin conditions, it applies to everything else. Just because youre skinny doesnt mean you can judge the overweight person and think that he/she is a greedy and lazy person.*

Please, this is a very essential skill to have, to learn and understand that others have reasons which you may not think of because you have not experienced their conditions first-hand. An insensitive remark can destroy a person's self esteem for good. 

I can say this because someone gave me a negative remark, months after that i still think of it and feel like shit, it is devastating.


Edit: Oh my god guys, thank you all for the support and the awards, i never expected this to blow up 😭🙏

Stay strong people, always remember there will be people who understand your struggles! 💪
