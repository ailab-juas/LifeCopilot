LPT: Use "C.A.R" or "S.T.A.R" in Job applications &amp; Interviews

content:
My [last post proved popular last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5mk342/lpt_use_car_or_star_in_job_applications_interviews), so thought to  re-share it again....Hopefully a bit more easier to understand.

&amp;nbsp;

When applying for jobs, or in interviews they want examples, not just  "I can do *X*", **prove** to them you *can* do *X*. 

It's ok to say "I can code, deal with angry customers, I can manage employees" - Anyone can say anything... But that's just empty words without backing up your statement/argument.

CAR is brief and to the point - Problem with that though, is when you apply for more senior jobs, they want a more in-depth application/interview...That's where S.T.A.R comes in.

S.T.A.R breaks down a scenario in to many pieces, creating a very detailed answer - You should always try to use STAR over CAR.

##CAR

**C**ontext  


"I deal with angry customers" becomes  


**C**ontext: Working as a receptionist I signpost customers. One day a customer came into the reception very agressive and demanding for *X* to be sorted out.  


**A**ction: Using my customer service training, I managed to calm down the customer and look into his complaint.


**R**esult: I managed to resolve the complaint, and the customer left happy. 

&amp;nbsp;

##STAR
**S**ituation: Working as a receptionist I signpost customers and assist with their queries. One day a customer came into the reception very aggressive and demanding for *X* to be sorted out.  

**T**ask: As the first point of contact, it is my responsibility to assist with enquiries as efficiently as possible, avoiding escalation where possible.  

**A**ction: Using my customer service training, I calmed down the customer and listened to his complaint. After verifying his details, 

I looked up his details on the system and noticed an anomaly which was affecting this customer. 
After liaising with another colleague, I managed to rectify this problem for the customer.  

**R**esult: The customer was very happy the problem was resolved, and left happy.

&amp;nbsp;

Hope this helps some. 

Feedback welcome.
