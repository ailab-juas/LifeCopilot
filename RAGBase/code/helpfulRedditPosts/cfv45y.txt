YSK that if you lock your pet, child, or any living thing in the car you can contact AAA whether you’re a member or not and they will get someone out to you as fast as humanly possible

Edit: usually I won’t edit but I guess people aren’t reading the whole post? I’m seeing the same comment repeatedly. This is obviously not a replacement for calling the authorities. I say in my post that this could be a potential replacement if police/fire cannot get there soon enough, AAA may or may not be an option to get help quicker but it’s worth a shot. 

For those asking- AAA is an international company (most popular in USA and Canada) but we do have clubs all over the world. Also of course breaking a window is the fastest option but you’d be surprised how many people don’t want to do that for whatever reason.



AAA will mark your call as a first priority and depending on location could have someone out there as soon as 10 minutes (or preferably before) to help you. Of course 911 should be the first call, but if for some reason that isn’t possible or the nearest officer is far away or whatever the circumstance, AAA will send someone out to you even if you haven’t paid for a membership.
