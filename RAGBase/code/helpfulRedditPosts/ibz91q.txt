YSK: If you feel you need therapy but can’t afford it, many places offer sliding-scale payment.

content:
EDIT: I am continuing to add to the master list of links in the main post as I do more research. 

This is a comment I make frequently (US specific), so I thought I’d add it here. I’ve helped a number of strangers find sliding-scale places in their areas. My partner once went for free for two years because of his financial situation. I recently helped someone else find a good therapist in their area for $30 a session. 

So if you feel like you need help—depression, anxiety, grief, trauma, etc—but don’t think you can afford it, make sure that’s not the case. I’m happy to help anyone look into their options. 

Another great resource if you’re in the States is [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/September-2016/How-Texting-Can-Help-Save-a-Life). You can literally text them for resources in your area. 

Finally, we tend to treat the brain differently than other parts of the body. As I often say to my students who are struggling, if you had low blood sugar, would you yell at it to raise itself? A broken foot? Of course not. You’d go to the doctor. The same should apply to the brain. There is no shame in seeking help. I’m fact, I’d argue it’s courageous. 

Hugs to everyone who’s struggling.

Edit: many people are reaching out to me via message. I will do my best to help each and every one of you, but please be a little patient; the floodgates have opened. 

Also, I’m proud of every single person who has had the courage to reach out, is now seeking therapy, or is even thinking about therapy. Make yourself a priority. You’re worth it.

Edit #2: Y’all are amazing. Thank you to everyone for the awards.

Edit #3: my phone is about to die, and I need to rest for a while (I’m quite ill). But I will be back later on, so don’t hesitate to reach out.

Edit #4: I’m going to go cuddle my dog and shut my brain down for the night, but I’ll be back tomorrow to keep responding to DMs and comments. Rest well, y’all.

Edit #5: Lists I’ve put together for folks. Thought I’d add this in case anyone was afraid to reach out but lives in one of these areas. :

Text NAMI, as they may be aware of resources I’m not. Still, this is a starting place.
