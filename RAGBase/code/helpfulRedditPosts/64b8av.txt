LPT: Most Baby Animals You Find Are Not Orphaned, Leave Them Be.

content:
Spring is here which means baby animal season is in full force. Below is a short list of common baby animals found around this time and how to respond if you find one:

* **Squirrels**: If you find a baby squirrel laying on the ground, check their surroundings. In most cases, they are at the base of a tree and it is best to leave them there! Momma has multiple nests in different locations. She will be active in finding her fallen baby immediately when she notices it. Place it in a shoe box lid next to the tree in direct sunlight to make sure it won't blindly crawl away from the tree. Leave it be till around 4pm and check back. If mom hasn't come to pick it up, bring it to your nearest wildlife rehabilitation shelter.

* **Bunnies**: Most baby bunnies found are because of a local pet taking it from a nest. If your cat has brought you a bunny or if it is injured, immediately bring it to a rehabilitation shelter since cat saliva is deadly! Otherwise, return all baby bunnies found back to its nest. Place leaves or string around the nest and leave it for a day. Mother rabbit only comes early morning and late at night! You will know if mom has returned if the leaves/string has been disturbed!

* **Oppossums**: Baby oppossums are usually found nearby a dead mother. If you find one, look around for a mother nearby. This is important because its siblings may still be resting in the dead mother's pouch! Take them all out of the pouch immediately because of the toxic milk and take them to your local shelter! Remember, opossums are harmless! They like to act tough and show teeth, but will play dead on instinct rather than fight (its a natural reaction, they cannot stop it). In addition, they salivate a lot but **are not a rabies carrying species; their body temperature is too low.**

* **Raccoons &amp; Skunks**: Babies of these sort should be taken very seriously. Raccoons can carry rabies and distemper at a young age while roughly 80% of raccoons carry baylisascaris, a dangerous parasite. Skunks are born with the ability to spray and can carry rabies without showing the signs up to 8 months. For these reasons, **please leave them alone.** Only intervene if they seem injured, emaciated, or so young that their eyes are not open. These furry friends are found roaming because they are big enough to be kicked out by mother.

* **Baby Songbirds**: Almost always you will find baby songbirds at the base of a tree chirping away. If that is the case, walk away and watch from afar. Most likely mother is watching nearby and ready to take it back. Give her time to realize it safe to swoop down and pick up her baby once you have left. These little guys get fed every 30 minutes, so its very common for mom or dad to notice their little fellas gone immediately! In fact, it is fine to place it back in its nest only if it is in reachable distance and the parents are not currently around. 

* **Baby Deer**: Fawns are irresistibly cute but are too often mistaken as orphaned! When a fawn is born, they do not move for **three days.** Mother is watching you nearby, guaranteed. Only if you spot the fawn in the same spot on the fourth day is when you should take action and contact a wildlife rehabilitation center. Give both a chance and watch hidden and afar!

While we are finishing up, some key notes: First, it is an old wives tale that parents will reject their babies because of human scent, so touching it to return it back to a nest is not harming its chances! Second, it is very common that a pet finds the wildlife and bring them to you so, for that reason, please place your pet on a leash (dogs) or keep them indoors (cats) for three days so the mother of the baby animals has a time to relocate! Third, never hesitate to call your local wildlife rehabilitation centers! We are here to help!
