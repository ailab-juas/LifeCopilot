LPT: Starting your own business does not mean you become your own boss. Your clientele is now your boss and you'll have to deal directly with them every day.

content:
I've seen personally people who get into business for themselves and think it's going to be a cakewalk because they're their "own boss" and completely neglect the fact that every separate customer or client could now make or break them, especially early on. Don't forget for every job you've had where you're low on the totem pole, there's people above you dealing directly with these issues and you're none the wiser because your boss is the one handling it, that's you now.
