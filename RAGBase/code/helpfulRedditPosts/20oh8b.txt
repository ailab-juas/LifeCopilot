YSK That Becoming a Bone Marrow Donor is EASY, Relatively Painless, and Is the Best and Often Only Chance to Save the Life of Many Cancer Patients.

content:
Many people around the world fit 1 of 2 categories (*from my personal experience*) when it comes to the topic of bone marrow donation:

1. Those that never heard about it and have no idea the potential good that can come of it.   
2. Those that *have* heard about it; often from older generations such as parents or grandparents and are under the assumption that the process is PAINFUL and COMPLICATED. (It's MUCH better now!)

**Why You Should Know about this?**

Currently 360 people a day are diagnosed with life threatening blood cancers; more than 130,000 PER YEAR are afflicted by leukemia, lymphoma, or one of more than 80 life threatening diseases.  These people can easily be your friends, family, co-workers, or neighbors and it strikes mercilessly - young children, healthy adults, grandparents, and shockingly even yourself (*speaking from personal experience*). 

Being a matched bone marrow donor and going through with a donation to any one of these people is THE BEST and usually ONLY CHANCE they have of surviving past a few years; for many, even less.

**What You Should Know in a Nutshell**

* Becoming a donor is often FREE (ages 18-44) and EASY (a cheek swab you get in the mail and send back via prepaid postage).

* IF you sign up, you have a 1 in 500 chance of ever being selected BUT that's like playing a free scratch off ticket and potentially saving a life if you win!

* Ever donated plasma? Donated blood? MOST donations are done through a Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) donation loosely similar to these common donations.  It just takes longer, is a bit more complicated, and pretty much painless.

* 1 in 2700 are asked to donate bone marrow directly.  You're knocked out for a bit, given fantastic painkillers, and are generally on your feet again after a couple of days.

* You have a lifetime risk of **1 in 84 of ~~being~~ dying in a car accident.**
* You have a lifetime risk of **1 in 1134 of drowning!**
