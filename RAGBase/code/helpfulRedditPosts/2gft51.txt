title:
LPT: Go introduce yourself to the foreign exchange student

content:
This comes from an ex-foreign exchange student who went to United States for a semester. The student will take it as a compliment that people in the local country want to meet them. You'll get an understanding of another culture. This person will also be able to introduce you to the other people who are trying to get to know this student because many probably are.

(I am not accountable if the person is a total asshole, but it is unlikely)
