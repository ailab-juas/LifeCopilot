LPT: Don't suggest to cancer survivors that they should feel "lucky to be alive" or be "grateful for their experience" if they open up to you about their mental state. This can be dangerous and reinforce feelings of guilt/shame.

content:
As a cancer survivor this was where everything went wrong after treatment was over. I felt angry about what happened to me and was extremely depressed. Many family members and friends told me I shouldn't feel that way and should be thankful to be alive. Every cancer survivor is different but most of us are still in a bad mental state for a long time afterwards.

Be a good friend, simply listen/remind them you care, and suggest seeing a professional for mental health care after cancer.

Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger, did not expect that!

Edit #2: A lot of people are misinterpreting this as sympathy farming or saying no one says these things to cancer survivors. People will say these things with a positive intent, not to actually be assholes. My LPT was to say that there are better options for approaching these conversations like listening, recommending mental health professionals, or saying things differently. The first reaction people usually have is to try and tell survivors that they are lucky to be alive (which seems like common sense to them) or to be grateful for the lessons the cancer experience taught them like not taking things for granted. But after cancer these are not the things survivor want to hear and can make them feel guilty for having suicidal or depressed feelings.
