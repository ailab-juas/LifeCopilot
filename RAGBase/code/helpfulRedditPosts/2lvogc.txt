title:
LPT: Ensure the gasket from the old oil filter isn't left behind when putting new one on.

content:
This could fit in TIL and TIFU as well. I learned this today after putting on a new filter, putting the new oil in and cranking her up. Only to hear a weird spewing. Found out the old gasket from the old filter was still on so it was basically rubber against rubber. 

Fail to check this and you will risk losing all oil so go ahead and have another 5 quarts ready if you aren't a doublechecker. I know I am now.
