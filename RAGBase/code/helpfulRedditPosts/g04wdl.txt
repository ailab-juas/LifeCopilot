LPT: Before you grab your pitchfork and dial up customer support to nuke them into oblivion

content:
I have been working in customer support for a while now and feel like people still don't know the basic (unwritten?) rules before calling. So here they are.

1. **We are here to help, NOT to serve.** So please address us as if you would address a normal human being who just wants to help you. We are not your loyal servants and you are not our liege.
2. **We are not all natives and that's okay.** Having a second, third or even fourth language is not very easy. So next time you call customer service and notice an accent or a grammar mistake in the agent's speech, acknowledge it in your mind and move on. There's no need for ugly comments about it. Be thankful that somebody actually took the time to learn your language so that they can be able to help you.
3. **We are not magicians.** Calling support does not equal to having your problem instantly solved. It's not a click-click-solved job. Before we can even start solving, we must make some inquiries. Sometimes it just cannot be solved by us. We either have to redirect you, ask you to solve a few things by yourself or simply let you know that the problem cannot be solved from various motives.
4. **We're not making the products/services/rules.** We are following them. It doesn't help to get angry with an agent because the product/service you bought is not good enough. We didn't produce it. We know how it works and that's what we can help you with. There are certain rules we MUST follow when handling a case, so when we tell you that we cannot do this and that, it's not because we don't feel like it. It's because we are not allowed. So please stop asking us to change the rules just for you. It's not like we're in charge.
5. **We are sometimes new and still learning.** Mostly, all agents go trough some kind of training before they start. Anyhow, that training cannot cover absolutely every aspect, so the agent will still learn even after a few months in the job. That's just how it is. If you feel that the agent is being insecure, it probably means that they have just started the job and are not very confident. Knowledge, experience and confidence only come with time. So cut us some slack, not all of us are senior agents.
6. **We're not (always) the problem.** You know that sweet, robotic like voice that most customer care agents have when they pick up? Yes, that is how we start each conversation. Most agents have the same nice attitude towards each customer that calls in. If you as a customer are already pissed off when you contact customer support and keep that attitude throughout the call, don't be so surprised that your experience sucked. Be kind, even if it's hard sometimes.
7. **We need those surveys.** They are not just for fun. Customer care agents really need the surveys, especially the good ones. The results reflect on our salary, so they do help a lot. So next time you get a survey, please take the 2 minutes to rate your experience, especially if it was a good one. And a nice little note on the side is always welcome. It makes us agents smile.
8. **We don't ignore your phone call.** There's not many things quite as frustrating as waiting in line, especially when you've been told for the last 20 minutes that you are number 1. Keep in mind that some phone calls are longer than others, agents also need and take breaks during the day, some phone lines are understaffed. So that very annoying line "all our agents are busy at the moment" is very true. It's not like we're just sitting at our desks and staring at that one call that's been in the queue for the last 30 minutes and laughing at it.
9. **We ask that many questions in order to help you.** It may seem that we're just asking the obvious, which we sometimes do. But we only do it in order to fully understand your problem. We cannot read your mind. We don't know the exact situation unless we ask about it. So don't be annoyed about our oh-so-obvious inquiries, just answer them.
10. **We're only human, after all. Be kind. Don't get angry.**

If you've come this far, I congratulate you. Now, I know that some agents can be rude from the very first second of the conversation. I know that not everyone tries as hard to solve a problem. But most of the time, we're nice, helpful people. And if customers would just follow the above mentioned rules, life would be so much easier and happier for both parties.
