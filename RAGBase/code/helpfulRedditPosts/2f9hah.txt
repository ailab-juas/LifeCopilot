LPT + TIL Combo: This small tip might make it easier for you to floss regularly.

Today at the dentist, after years of slightly sugar coating how much I floss, finally said....

"I don't know, I wasn't too good about it. It obviously works and should be done, but I think it's stupid taking a piece of string and spreading dirt and nastiness from one area of your tooth to another... how does that even clean it?"

She looked surprised at my understanding of flossing.

Apparently flossing isn't *just* to remove plaque or whatever by scraping it away... it's actually also is to disrupt bacteria colonies that "settle" in your mouth, undisturbed, kind of like an anthill or something. And by flossing you're destroying all their colonies and stomping on all the anthills... you're not just "removing gunk".

I found this way more interesting, and immediately helpful in my quest to learn how not to hate flossing. When I heard it explained that way it didn't seem like a far-fetched idea that works for everyone else except me, but rather an immediately applicable concept where I'm destroying the homes of bacteria in my mouth that cause plaque and cavities.
