LPT: Bring a bag of snacks from your home country when travelling. It's a nice way to thank people for their help if you get lost, make a friend, have a great host etc.

A family share bag with individually wrapped chocolates, cookies or candies work well. I handed out  chocolate cookies from Japan when I was in Europe. It's really rewarding to see people's faces light up and hopefully it'll get them interested in your country too.
