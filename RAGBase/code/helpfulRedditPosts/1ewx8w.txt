YSK That if you've been adversely affected by a disaster (such as the Oklahoma City tornado), you may be granted a temporary credit limit increases or relief from your credit card payment and interest responsibilities while you get back on your feet.

I work for a major, to-remain-nameless Credit Card company (due to my company's stance on social networking and blogging, not because I want to keep the company's name a secret).  I am writing as an individual, not a representative of the company.

Many times, credit card companies are a bit hamstrung by the industry that they exist in.  Although you may have a perfectly good reason for requesting relief from payments for a month, or a credit limit increase, federal law mandates that customers with similar credit qualifications be treated similarly.  Simply put, your credit score and history determine how much a bank can help you, despite factors such as your personal situation or your relationship with a bank.

Federal law provides the opportunity for customers affected by major disasters to receive temporary relief from their payment and interest responsibilities while they are getting their life back in order.  Things that credit card companies may offer you in time of a disaster include:

* Emergency credit limit increases to accommodate living expenses such as food, water, or temporary housing (such as hotels). 
* Zeroing out your minimum payment due.
* Bringing your account current if you've missed one payment (even if not due to the disaster).
* If you've missed more than one payment, offering special payment programs to help bring you back current.
* Approving purchases above your credit limit.
* Holding interest charges from applying to your account for a period of months.

Usually a credit card company's ability to provide this assistance depends upon a formal declaration of a disaster by the government, as well as approval from the bank's board of directors to begin offering the assistance.  Additionally, assistance for a disaster is usually limited to a specific time frame.

If you have been affected by the tornados, or suspect that you may need help in near future, **call the number on the back of your card now.**  The sooner you call, the more your credit card company can do to help  you out.

If your card was lost, stolen, or destroyed in the disaster and you are unsure of what number to call to request assistance, call the main issuer of the card, who can help you get in touch with the issuing bank.  Those numbers are:

* Visa International: 1-800-247-2911
* American Express: 1-800-528-4800
* Mastercard: 1-800-627-8372
* Discover: 1-800-347-2683

Edit: Thanks for helping this get to the front page, everyone. I edited some grammar, but I also wanted to take a moment to make a couple of points here.

1. I am an employee of a credit card company, and I make no attempt to hide that, but that really is beside the point here. I'm not writing this post as an employee of that company, but as a private citizen who knows a lot about the business from a lot of different perspectives, and simply wants to get the word out that there's help out there. If anyone can think of a good way for me to prove this, I'd be happy to do so. I'd also be happy to answer any general credit card related questions you might have. Feel free to PM me if you'd like.

2. Some have mentioned that NGOs will cover virtually all living expenses. This is very true, and I urge anyone who's been affected by this tragedy to do their research and utilize all resources available to them. It is never a good idea to put your basic, every-day cost of living on a credit card, and you should avoid doing so if at all possible. 

3. A couple of users have sent me Gold as a thank you. I really appreciate it! 

That said, I'm really only making this post to be helpful, so please, if you see this or any other post with info about how to help victims of this or any other tragedy, please consider making a donation in OP's name before sending Gold. That, to me, would be a far better use of the money involved. I'm not sure how much Gold is running these days, but I'll make a donation to the Red Cross that's equal to a couple months of Gold to offset what was given to me. That way everybody wins.

Thanks again, everyone.
