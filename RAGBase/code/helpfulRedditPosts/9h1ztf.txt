LPT: If you’re about to take an air conditioner out of your window, check from the outside to be sure no bees, wasps, or hornets have built a nest on it.

EDIT: A lot of people are asking for the story that prompted this. Terribly sorry to disappoint everyone but the only story is that I was outside with some friends last night and noticed a rather small, but still waspy, wasps nest on our air conditioner unit. If this stupid east coast humidity and heat ever subsides we’ll be removing it in the next week or 2 so I thought this would be good to share. No one was hurt in the making of this LPT.
