LPT: When doing a Craigslist exchange, meet in a police station parking lot (for the legal ones)

content:
I've been seeing a lot of these assaults/shootings related to Craigslist in the news recently. Seriously? There are police stations everywhere. If you are meeting someone, just go to a station parking lot. You might still get shot, but the bastard is going to get nabbed for sure.

I don't think I would usually have to say this next part, but this IS the internet. If you are doing something pseudo-legal to straight criminal with your Craigslist exchange, avoiding a police parking lot is probably the wiser choice. An emergency room waiting area might be a good alternative. At least if you get shot, help is close by.
