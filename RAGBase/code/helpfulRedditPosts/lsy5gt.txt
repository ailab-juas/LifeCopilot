[LPT] You Don't Hate Vegetables -- You Hate the way your Parents (Over)Cooked Vegetables

content:
A lot of people don't know how to cook or season vegetables apart from steaming them, maybe with a little salt or butter/oil. Steaming is easy to overdo, and works best with very fresh seasonal veggies - anything that is frozen, canned, or even just spent more than a few days on the shelf will most likely wind up mushy and unappealing. Learn how to grill, roast, or even fry different vegetables, try out different seasonings or sauces, and be amazed at the horizons of deliciousness ten-year-old you never knew existed.

EDIT: Apparently this is a sore subject with some people! You \*PROBABLY\* don't hate vegetables, but individual tastes and physiologies differ of course. No one should ever be harassed over allergy or sensory processing issues. The point is to learn to cook things different ways before you write them off. Sorry that people have given you a hard time about this, but if your reply begins with "my mom/dad/wife/etc does know how to cook" and not "I know how to cook" then the source of the issue is pretty clear.

EDIT 2: Holy crap, that's a lot of awards. Thank you all, and I discovered the real LPT, which is that people with food limitations know exactly what does and doesn't work for them and often share lovely tips for alternative ingredients and techniques, while picky eaters tell you to f--- off.
