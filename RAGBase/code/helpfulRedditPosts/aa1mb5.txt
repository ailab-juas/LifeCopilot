YSK about Project Gutenberg. They have over 57,000+ FREE ebooks that are in the public domain (books whose copyrights have expired).

content:
Starting from 2019, they will add a lot more books from 1923 to the database because of the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998. However, as Project Gutenberg states,  "**Our eBooks may be** [**freely used**](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:No_Cost_or_Freedom%3F) **in the United States** because most are not protected by U.S. copyright law, usually because their copyrights have expired. They may not be free of copyright in other countries. Readers outside of the United States must check the copyright terms of their countries before downloading or redistributing our eBooks."

Edit: Woah, this post gained a lot of traction. I think I should add the obligatory. I am not trained in any form of law. I will not accept any liability  for any damages caused to you in this regard. Sorry for the kind of ominous sound of that, just thought I should add it. Enjoy!
