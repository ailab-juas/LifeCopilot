LPT: Try and be in the best shape of your life the older you become.

content:
As we age, the likelihood of ending up in the hospital for an extended stay rises.  It's important to be in the best shape of your life so you can weather any illnesses or complications that may occur.  Being on a ventilator, in a coma, or just being bedbound for any length of period puts a tremendous strain on the body.  The stronger you are going in, the better your body will be when coming out of whatever it was that put you in the hospital.  Please exercise daily, no matter how little you're able to do.  Furthermore, please please please try and get your parents/grandparents to also perform some sort of physical activity every single day.

Example: My mother passed away last week due to complications from a thyroidectomy.  Had she been otn better physical shape and not as fragile going into the surgery, she would have likely survived.

Edit: Holy shit I was hoping just one person would read this and go for an evening walk, and it has definitely exceeded that. Thank you all for the condolences.  Seeing all of these comments have brought some joy to this part of my life.  Thank you again.
