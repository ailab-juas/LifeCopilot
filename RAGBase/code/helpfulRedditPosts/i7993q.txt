title:
YSK finding a kitten alone doesn't mean it is abandoned. His mother may be out hunting, wait a few hours before stealing it.

content:
As the title says, separating a stray kitten from his mother at a very young age could be detrimental to his character. The kitten will learn to depend too much on humans and maybe bite or cause a lot of damage because his mother didn't teach him how to behave.

Please wait at least for 4-5 hours for the mother to return. 

It pains my heart when the cat mother returns with the food only to find her child was stolen.
