LPT: Instead of saying to yourself, "I don't have time for _______", say "_______ isn't a priority right now". It's amazing how much impact that simple reframing can have.

content:
For example, if you are making excuses for not exercising and you say "I just don't have time to exercise these days", if you think of it as "exercise isn't a priority to me these days" it sounds different and might actually help you rearrange your priorities. It can also help clarify the things that are not in fact, priorities at the moment. It works great for me all the time and helps me realize how much I value things like eating healthy and exercise.

EDIT: Glad to see so many people also think this is useful, but I am surprised at how many people don't understand what the word "priority" means or how saying something to yourself does not equal saying it to your partner or co-worker aloud.
