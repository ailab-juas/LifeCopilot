LPT: If you have an indoor cat, put "Name (Indoor cat)" on the name tag. That way, if someone finds your cat, they will know that it is not supposed to be outside and call you.

Many cats are outdoor cats, so a kind stranger will probably not call you if they find your cat outside. But if you make it clear that it is supposed to be inside, this can greatly increase your chances of being reunited with your furbaby!

Edit: A lot of people are bringing up the Orange Collar Project. This is a FANTASTIC idea and great to use in conjunction with the tag concept. The idea is that if your indoor cat breaks out, it is a kitty convict that needs to be returned home! I have looked for orange collars in pet stores, and they are pretty hard to find. Here is a [link](https://www.amazon.com/Kitty-Convict-Cat-ID-Collars/dp/B018IRQ316) to some Kitty Convict collars ($14) for anyone interested.
