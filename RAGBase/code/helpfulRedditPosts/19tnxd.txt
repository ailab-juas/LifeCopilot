LPT: Always walk in like you own the place...

content:
Because someday you might. A business, a house, everywhere you go. Have respect for it, treat it as if it's yours, and keep it as clean as you can. You'll be developing etiquette and manners while building your own self-confidence.

**Edit:**

Number 1 in LPT. Cool.

Many of you are clearly going out of your way to askew its meaning. Most people associate the phrase "walking around like he/she owns the place" as a negative, that the person has a sense of entitlement to do whatever they want to because they are the owner. That's just being a douche. 

Think of a business you would like to run, or a place you would love to live in. How would you treat it? Would you act like a dick to your customers or to your tenants? Or would you treat everyone there with respect and a smile, because treating them that way creates a friendlier, more welcoming environment and stronger relationships?

The idea behind "because someday you might" is important because in the future you could be known as "that person who *way back then* already started to make the place what it is today" versus "that person that pooped on the floor because he/she felt like it."

Since this thread is already at the top, I understand most of you already get what I meant. This clarification if for the floor poopers.
