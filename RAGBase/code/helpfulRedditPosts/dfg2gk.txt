LPT: Bad habit of picking at healing scabs? Gently file the scab with a nail file. It won't remove the scab or but will smooth off the sharp bits that are appealing to listless fingers.

I'm clumsy af and work with my hands so I often have minor cuts healing on my hands. This definitely helps me leave them alone when they're almost healed.

It's probably best not to touch fresh scabs though.
