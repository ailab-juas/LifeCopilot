LPT: Use public records to negotiate your salary

content:
If you're considering a job at a government institution, you can usually look up the salaries of other employees as these are often public record. Use that data to negotiate your own salary. I recently took a job in the University of California system, and wish I had looked up the salaries of other people recently hired in my division - I think I'm getting a bit less than others with similar experience. You can usually Google around to find this info. For example, [here is a database for California employees](http://www.sacbee.com/site-services/databases/state-pay/article2642161.html), and [here's one for Texas](https://salaries.texastribune.org/). Never hurts to have the info when they ask you what you hope to make.
