title:
LPT: If someone uses a made-up fact during an argument, reply with "Why do you think that ...?"

content:
It works so much better than "No, it's not true, actually [something else]". Instead of escalating the conflict and antagonising the other person, it makes them slow down to think and actually present their rationale to you... or notice they don't have a good one.

You can continue with "Okay, but I think that..." and you end up with 2 voiced opinions that you can compare and contrast.
