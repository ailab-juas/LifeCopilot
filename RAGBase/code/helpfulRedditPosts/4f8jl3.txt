LPT: You can save someone's life

content:
Today I bought a homeless man a chocolate milkshake from McDonald's because he asked. Instead of just handing it to him and leaving, I decided to sit down and talk to him. 3 hours later of intense conversation which changed his and my outlook on life. Near the end of the conversation he tells me that after getting a milkshake he was going to go to the bridge and commit suicide. He told me that he made a promise to a friend that if something stopped him from going to the bridge after the milkshake that he wouldn't do it. He started to cry and tell me that if it wasn't for this simple act of talking with him, he was going to end his life. 

People around us are hurting emotionally, and most don't show it. Sometimes all it takes is a simple human to human conversation to save someone's life.

Edit 1: Free hand drawing and poetry that the homeless guy did. There are black scraps to cover his and someone else's name. https://imgur.com/a/FkdDn
