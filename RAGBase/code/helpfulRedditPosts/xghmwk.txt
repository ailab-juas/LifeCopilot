YSK: Feeding, approaching or petting a stranger's horses in their fields is generally frowned upon

content:
**Why YSK:** Although horses are beautiful and some are friendly, as a rule you should always speak to the owner of the horse to get permission before you touch or feed them. You could potentially harm the horse, endanger yourself, or just generally cause unfriendly anxiety for the owner of the horse.

This rule should be applied to any animal that you do not know beforehand; I wouldn't dream of stopping my car to feed your dog treats through the fence, but you wouldn't believe how often it happens to my horse. My horse is a big lovable lump. He's very food motivated (like his owner lol) and will strut right up to the fence line for pets and treats from random passers by. I'll be in the barn on any given day and at least one person slows the car and pulls over to see the horses. This happens whenever I keep him at a facility where a fenceline borders a road, and although I get a kick out of how many different cars I see stopping, it also makes me a bit nervous.

**YSK: Feeding, approaching or petting a stranger's horses in their fields is generally frowned upon TL;DR VERSION:**

* Horse digestive systems suck ASS so it doesn't take much to kill them
* Vets are expensive (god love 'em)
* Some horses have metabilic disorders, so your apples can trigger horsey diabetes (basically)
* Emergency vet calls are super duper expensive
* When fed by hand some horses can get quite... bitey
* I'd rather my horse respect fences at all costs - the grass growing on the other side is tempting enough
* Horse theft is very real and we're not allowed to hang people for it anymore
* I don't know you. Are you going to climb the fence, hop on my horse's back, fall off and try to sue me? Are you going to stage the place so you can rob it later? I don't know because I don't know you!

If you care to read and perhaps learn a little about horses in the process:

First I just want to say I love to share my horse with everyone, he's basically a big puppy dog! My love for horses is the kind that's so crazy that even seeing people pet my horse makes me happy. I understand how neurotic it may sound to say don't feed my horses when your palm full of apples or whatever is not going to hurt a 1700lb animal. Please hear me out.

I'm serious when I say their digestive systems suck ass. GET THIS: horses do not puke. Based on the size of my guy's dumps I hate to imagine how much he could spew lol.. but it sucks because the alternative is dying. Like instead of puking their guts basically twist up and basically they could explode and then they die (slightly more nuanced but that's all you need to know). It's the stupidest thing in the world, death by gas *I know*, but basically anyone that loves horses shudders when they hear the "C" word, which is colic and *definitely not* cunt. Crazy to think how much people/dogs/cats actually puke when they need to though. I've heard **horror stories of horses dying from colic after they were fed usual suspects such as ground apples that were fermented, grass clippings, and bread.** This is why we act like you are holding a gun to our horse's head *when really you are holding a grade A apple that frankly I don't even buy for myself to eat because I'm poor because I'm an idiot and I have a horse*. It's because my beautiful horse's dietary restrictions are annoyingly very real and very stupid. If you want to feed somethign random to an animal, try the farm's dog. She ingests paper coffee cups and shop rags and she's like 16.

But really, I'd rather not have random strangers always stopping by the fence. It really freaks me out. If you wanted to steal him, my idiot horse would walk on his front hooves backwards straight onto your trailer if you promised him like 2/3 of a dang apple (bragging a bit because a lot of horses are scared of the trailer lol).

And if you're thinking "why not just put up signs", well, I don't personally own the property I keep my horse at. Not my fence, not my ~~aestetic~~ aesthetic decision. I don't even want to have that conversation with the farmer who I keep my horse with. Not knocking the purpose of the sign but I do find the concept to be quite...brash. "DO NOT FEED THE HORSES". In my opinion, people who want to tresspass/not pick up dog shit/feed animals will likely do so regardless of any sign passively warning them not to. If it were my farm I'd have a bucket of treats that I do want my horse to eat with a sign saying feed them at your own risk, a selfie station, and a little donation box ;)
