title:
LPT don’t waste your time at hotels trying to be nice.

content:
If you stay at a hotel and you are checking out don’t make your bed or try to make it look nice this doesn’t help housekeeping because they have to change the sheets and if you do this it could result in them not changing the sheets and the next person sleeping in dirty sheets. Also you don’t need to wrap all the dirty sheets together just leave it how it is when you get out of bed. Also don’t be a jerk about it but if you just let the front desk know any issues you had with your stay we want to know any issues and sometimes give you a small discount maybe take off your parking if you tell the front desk the issues.
