LPT: If you struggle with keeping a tidy home, never leave a room empty-handed. Always find something that doesn’t belong in that room and take it with you to put it where it belongs.

I personally hate an untidy home. However, in the hustle &amp; bustle of life, sometimes things get a little messy. To help prevent the mess in the first place, put things away in your home as you walk around doing normal things. For me, the most common thing I always have lying around is cups of water. They’re everywhere. Now each time I leave my bedroom, living room etc, I grab that cup and put it in the sink. It’s done wonders for me &amp; I feel like I need to tidy up less. Hope this helps someone!
