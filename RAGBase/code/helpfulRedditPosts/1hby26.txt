LPT: If you ever kill a fly in your house, do not put it in your garbage can. It may be carrying live maggots which will feed and multiply.

Made this mistake once before, they will feed and multiply on your trash.

EDIT- yes, I admit it. I didn't take the trash out for three days once after dumping some old food in there. But there wasn't much to take out in my defense.
