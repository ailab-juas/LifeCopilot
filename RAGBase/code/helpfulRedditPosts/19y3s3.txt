LPT: Introduce people to one another

content:
I'm baffled at how often someone will show up someplace with a friend who doesn't know the rest of the group, say hello, and then just stand there while the new fish is forced to awkwardly introduce him or herself.

I always make it a point to simply go "Hey guys, this is my friend Jimjam. Jimjam this is Bingbong and Chipchip, I know them from when I worked in that salt mine."

Nobody is ever going to dislike it when you do this and you'll make everyone feel more at ease.
