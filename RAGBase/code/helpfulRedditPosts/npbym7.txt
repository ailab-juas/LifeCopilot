YSK: Someone setting a boundary with you isn't being rude or pushing you out of their life. It's setting the conditions for you to remain in their life.

Why YSK: If you, or someone else, needs to set boundaries, then it is a sign that the current interactions are not sustainable for the relationship to survive or be healthy.  

Rather than be offended that a boundary is being set, or feeling that you're being rude by setting a boundary, realize that this is a way to establish best practices in the relationship (whether romantic, friend, colleague, neighbor, etc.) so all parties can get the best out of the relationship.  

If a person is unwilling to adhere to the boundary being set, then you know that perhaps you don't share mutual values with the person and you can decide if this person is worth the energy to continue the relationship. 

Also, people aren't mind readers, so clear communication about expectations can resolve drama or hurt feelings about the behavior, intent,  etc.
