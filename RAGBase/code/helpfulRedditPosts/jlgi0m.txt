LPT: If you are randomly mentioned in a google slides comment by an email youâ€™ve never seen before, do NOT open the google slide doc. It is a new, almost undetectable way to hack your email. Delete it immediately and empty your trash.

You can try to report it as spam but you may have to open the doc to do that so just delete asap and empty your trash.
