LPT: Minimize your wallet and put it in your front pocket! (the case against the back-pocket wallet).

content:
Do you carry your wallet in your back pocket? Is your wallet as thick as gourmet sandwich?  Have you ever experienced lower back pain? 

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, let me unfold the secret.  
Since the invention of credit cards, or even wallets for that matter, people have been cramming more and more things into it for fear of forgetting some notes, or cards, or IDs that they might need as they are out and about daily.  
A [New York Times Health article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/17/health/17real.html) once reported:  
&gt;The report, about a lawyer who suffered aches and pains in the left leg...doctors say the condition has become increasingly common. Its onset is gradual, caused by an object that presses on the piriformis muscle in the buttocks, which is connected to the sciatic nerve, which runs down the leg.
&gt;Over time, a person can develop radiating pain in the back and hip area.  


**The case for thin front-pocket wallet**

* *You don't need a credit card album for a wallet.* Get a low-profile card wallet. A thin wallet is usually able to hold a maximum of maybe six cards. The most an average person needs maybe a combination of 3-4 debit/credit card, and an ID card. (leave your state ID at home when you have a Driver's license).
* *Keep notes out of wallet*. Start taking notes on your smartphone or if you must have physical notes, keep them in your other pockets. You're less likely to forget the note and can act on it rather than being kept inside a wallet.
* *Switch to money clip*. If you must carry cash, an effective but minimal way to organize your dollar bills is to keep them folded neatly with money clip.
* *keep your wallet in your front pocket.* Pickpockets are less likely to grab your wallet from the front pocket. You avoid back pain and sciatia. And as an added bonus, no unsightly backpocket sandwich.

Now that's a four-*fold* benefit, don't you think?
