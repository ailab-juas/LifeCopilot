LPT: If you fly more than once a year and are not a terrorist, get TSA PreCheck

content:
Or more specifically, get Global Entry. It's $100 and it's good for five years. For $20 a year you get to keep your shoes on, laptops in bags, and absolutely fly through the line. It is absolutely worth every penny. LPT#2: some credit cards will pay for the $100 fee (catch: those credit cards have an annual fee)
