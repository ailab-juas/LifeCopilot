title:
LPT: if you share a bed with someone else, get separate comforters/blankets for each of you.

content:
I never did this until my current gf suggested it. It is sooooo much better than sharing. You can still cuddle and touch and everything but i sleep so much better because when you turn over you can move the blanket or wrap yourself in it.

Seriously, its like sharing a bed but still sleeping separately.
