LPT: When a product breaks or malfunctions, even if it’s out of warranty or it’s your fault, don’t just throw it away. Contact the company and let them know that you love the product and ask if there are any options to replace it. Frequently, they will either offer a discount or a free replacement.

EDIT: People keep asking for examples, here are a few that come to mind, but there are many, many more. I may add more as I think of them. Here are a few companies that have taken care of me outside of warranty for items over $100, and only one I asked for it for free (Chevy out-of-warranty repair). 

* Nordstrom: jeans that split in the seams after about a year they replaced no questions asked.

* Apple: replaced two iPhones over the course of 3-4 years outside of Apple Care that were malfunctioning after I broke the screen. Never asked for free phone. Went in for screen fix, they just replaced entire phone free.

* Apple: 2015 MacBook Pro having random issues. They thought it was the battery / fan assembly and charged me $220 to replace, but said it could be the logic board. If Logic Board, I would pay the difference ($550 minus $220). They even gave me a written quote. Found out after another month it was the Logic Board, but when I brought back in, they offered to replace the Logic board free for the inconvenience of bringing in a second time, and I never even suggested getting a discount on it or acted inconvenienced. Just being friendly with the staff.

* Kühl clothing: had a $250 puffy winter jacket, picked up a hot soup pan and melted it clean through. Composed a very funny email and picture documenting and sent to them and asked if I could pay to have it repaired since I’m such a klutz and melted it. Instead, they immediately sent me a brand new jacket. I didn’t even pay for shipping.

* Chevy: new-ish car at 40k miles or so. Needed expensive out-of-warranty repair after my car had already spent 3 weeks in the shop a few months earlier. I did ask for this one, because it was so close to the warranty period still and I wasn’t terribly happy with the reliability record of the car. They obliged.

* Rode microphones: Shockmount for a professional microphone broke. I called customer service to order a new one (3-4 year old product), and saw they were $50 on the website. Just told him it broke and I wanted to order a replacement part, instead they just offered to send a replacement free of charge. Didn’t even pay shipping.

* Verizon Wireless: broke screen on iPhone X, called customer service to see if I had the device protection (thought I did). Didn’t ask for anything free, just asked her if there were any options available, the rep said she’d gladly split the cost of the repair with me and promptly credited my account for $137.50 right on the same phone call.

* Blinds company (?): found receipt, limited warranty, I admitted having to pull them down hard to get them to close, possibly being responsible for the damage. I paid shipping to send them in, they repaired for free.
