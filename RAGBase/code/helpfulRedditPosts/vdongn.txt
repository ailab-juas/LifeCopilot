YSK about Planned Parenthood’s informed consent HRT

content:
Why YSK: If you’re trans or know someone who is that hasn’t transitioned yet that is able to access a Planned Parenthood, this is a much simpler way to start hormone replacement therapy.

So many trans people go through the bullshit process of waiting years to be able to go on hormones. The mental health system and gender dysphoria do not mix well, for some reason.

At Planned Parenthood, they offer informed consent HRT. You set up an appointment, they ask about your transition goals, give you packets full of information on hormones and intake methods, set you up with hormones, and you leave with a prescription.

Simple, easy, done, and much better than the alternative system. I learned about this my freshman year of high school, and a month after I turned 18 I was transitioning.

[Here is a link](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-greater-new-york/get-care/our-services/transgender-services) to their services, if you or anyone you know is interested.

EDIT: Y’all transphobes are giving me a good laugh. Love y’all, I hope you find peace ☮️
