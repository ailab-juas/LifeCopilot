LPT: Don't buy your textbooks for school before you go to class. Wait for the professor to go over the syllabus to see if the textbook is actually required and it can potentially save you hundreds of dollars.

I've been doing this since I started college and it's saved me $500+ 

This semester alone I saved $200 from not buying 2 textbooks that weren't mandatory
