YSK about the 'Good Samaritan in Drug Overdose Act', a Canadian Law which provides some legal protection for individuals (or their friends) who seek emergency help during a drug overdose, and their American Counterparts: '911 Good Samaritan' laws in some states.

# For Americans (Update):

[This](http://pdaps.org/datasets/good-samaritan-overdose-laws-1501695153) interactive site displays Samaritan laws by state (as of January 1 2007 to July 1, 2018). Much more up to date than my [previous link](http://choopersguide.com/content/911-good-samaritan-laws-by-state.html).

I sincerely apologize for any misinformation I spread by not properly researching the previous link, I was not expecting this to blow up the way that it has, but I still should have looked into that more thoroughly. My baddest of bads.

Also, if you want to help bring good samaritan laws to your state, [this website](https://drugfree.org/help-bring-good-samaritan-laws-to-your-state/.html) has a form letter. If you feel passionately about this issue in your home state, then please reach out.
