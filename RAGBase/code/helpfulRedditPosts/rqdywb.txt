LPT: Put a bar of soap in your dresser.

content:
Titel pretty much says it, i got a bar of "high quality" (around 15â‚¬) soap as a present for Christmas by my mom. At first I thought maybe you should change your t-shirt more often but she just laughed and says it isn't for washing your body, but rather to but it in your dresser.

And four days later i am here saying it's a game changer! 
Every time you open your dresser you get welcomed by the smell of oranges! And of course your clothes get a bit of that scent too, carrying the light scent of oranges into your day

Highly recommend, 11/10

Edit: Grammar

Edit 2: I want to add that the soap is still wrapped in paper so it doesn't make direct contact to wood or clothes, for the people who don't want oily stains

Edit 3: i am an idiot. I have a closet, not a dresser. Works fine for both i guess
