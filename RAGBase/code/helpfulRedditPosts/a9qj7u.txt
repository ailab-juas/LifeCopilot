LPT: if you are buying something high quality, prefer material over brand. For example, a good merino wool pair of sock will be almost certainly better than a fancy cotton one. Or a good full grain leather belt will be almost certainly better than a fancy genuine leather one.

Of course, if budget allows, you can choose both material and brand for maximum quality.
