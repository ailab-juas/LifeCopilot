LPT: When changing jobs try to schedule a few days or a week off between the end of the first job and the start of the new job to ensure you're rested and ready.

By chance I ended up with a blank week between my old and new job and I was able to hit the ground running like never before when I started due to the time i had to deload from my old job. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is able to try it.
