YSK: If you're considering seeking professional help for mental issues but are not sure if you're feeling''bad enough'' to do so, definitely do it

Why YSK: I know a lot of people who have considered this, and one of the most common things that held them back was the thought that they weren't feeling bad enough to have the right to seek and receive help. It's important to recognize your thoughts and feelings as real, and the fact that some people might feel worse does not mean you don't have the right to talk to someone about it.

Edit: I am lucky enough to live in a country where you can get a certain amount of hours for free. I am aware of the fact that in some countries it is not available at a reasonable price, which is pretty fucked up if you ask me. My point is just that if there are no other (financial) factors that hold you back, you should go for it.
