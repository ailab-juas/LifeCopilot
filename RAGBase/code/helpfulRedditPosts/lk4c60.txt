LPT: if your kids leave markers open all night and they dry up, don't throw them out. Dip the tip in water for a minute or two and then close them up for a few hours and they'll be good as new.

Edit: apparently this only works for water based markers. Alcohol based markers should be dipped in... Alcohol. What a world. 

Edit2: thanks for the awards! It's my first awarded post so that's nice

Edit3: my wife has informed me she deserves the credit and awards for this, but it's her own fault for not having a reddit account so :p
