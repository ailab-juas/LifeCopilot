LPT: Struggling to find a thoughtful gift for a guy? Pay attention to small things that frustrate them.....

content:
Been with my wife for almost 23 years, and she has always gotten me great gifts, even early on when we didn’t have much money to spend on each other.  About 10 years in we got into a conversation about how I find it so difficult to come up with thoughtful gifts compared to how adept she seems to be.  When I asked her how she did it, she casually said,

“I pay attention to what makes you curse!”

And I’ll be damned if the vast majority of the gifts that I found most memorable and oft-used were the direct result of the thing that guys often catch a bad rap for trying to do for others.......solving problems.

Did I trip over a power cable multiple times building out her chicken coop?  Cordless drill.

Was I always complaining about how I can’t get my pillow to support my head throughout the night?  Contour pillow.

Remarking how much I hated constantly cleaning out the gutters underneath a big oak tree?  Gutter covers.

That’s it.  Simple stuff that often doesn’t break the bank.  

That being said, of course there is room for gifts that don’t have to solve a problem and are a little more extravagant or frivolous and just make somebody happy, but I’ve put this technique into use in the years since and always come up with great gifts for the guys in my life.

Understand that this LPT isn’t exclusively for men, of course.  I think it can be applied fairly easily as long as it just comes from paying attention to your friends/family......at the very least it will make them feel great to know somebody is paying attention.
