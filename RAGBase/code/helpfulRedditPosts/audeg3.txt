LPT: If clothes or towels have a mildew smell, add some plain white vinegar to the washing machine, along with detergent, for the freshest smelling laundry ever. Note: Clothes will NOT smell like vinegar. It is highly diluted as well as going through the rinse cycle. Tried and true. Thanks Grandma!

To freshen a load of laundry, try 2 cups of distilled white vinegar. For mildew odors you can double and triple this amount. Hot or warm water works best. I have a top loading machine — I let the drum fill with water and put the vinegar in once it fills, right on top of the clothes. I’ve had my washing machine over 10 years and vinegar hasn’t shortened the life of my machine or my laundry for that matter. I have used an entire gallon on kids clothes that came back from summer camp filthy and damp with the worst mildew smell. It also works as a fabric softener. It’s the best.
