LPT: when cleaning, just say I’m going to put away 3 things that are in my sight. It’s a low barrier to get started and you’ll clear the easiest items first.

content:
Usually the things that make me feel overwhelmed are those without a clear location and that can make cleaning feel like a daunting task. After you’re done, pick the next 3. 

And even if don’t and have limited time, cleaning a little bit is always better than not at all cause stuff doesn’t pile on as much.
