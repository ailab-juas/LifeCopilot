YSK: Studies show that the older you are, the more you value experiences over material goods. When picking presents. Toys will bring more happiness for children, experiences for older folks.

content:
Your expensive TV in 10 years will just be an old TV that might need a replacement while the memory of a fun trip will create some fun talking points and joy. In other words, its value only increases with time while a material gift's value only decreases with time.


[This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167811620300045) study found that children up to 12 years old prefer material gifts while children over 12 years old prefer experience-based gifts. Explaining the results: our memory develops and in general, the older we get, the more we value our memories. Material gifts don't tend to create many fun memories compared to experience-based ones.

If someone likes these kinds of studies, [here](https://cognisera.com/what-present-to-buy-for-a-friend/) you can find many more of them summarized. They explore different factors and scenarios.

The conclusion about the main question is the same in almost all of them - most people derive more happiness from experience-based gifts and purchases. 

**Why YSK**: It's a good thing to know if you want to make others happier. Sure, everyone is different but it's good to have general knowledge, what gifts will more likely make someone happier.
