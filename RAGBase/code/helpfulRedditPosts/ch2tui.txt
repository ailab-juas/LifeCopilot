YSK: Tossing food waste (like banana or orange peels) in nature is often detrimental to the environment and should be disposed of properly

content:
This is pretty niche but I hike/camp a lot and didn’t know this until I really started spending more time outdoors so I thought I would share it here. Tossing food waste onto the ground, even if it’s “biodegradable” can be really bad for the environment and defies [Leave No Trace](lnt.org) practices. Even food that breaks down quickly doesn’t usually break down fast enough for a critter to get to and can attract wildlife to areas they aren’t accustomed to (or feed them things they’re not supposed to have). I used to throw my banana peels out the window on long trips because “hey, it’s biodegradable, it’s fine!” But once I learned about this, I am the person who picks up food waste when I see it... which sucks when you’re doing a day hike to the bottom and back to the top of the Grand Canyon and see orange peels the whole way on the trail up! But I’m saying, it’s a really good thing to be aware of- whenever you are outside and you’re doing stuff, just make sure you don’t leave stuff behind- whether it’s plastic, food, or otherwise!

Edit:
I woke up to this getting a lot more attention than I originally thought it would and the original link to a “source” (albeit, not the best one according to some of the comments I am seeing) is not actually linked so here are some great sources or places you can learn more about food litter and Leave No Trace practices.

I’ll try to find more but I have two young kids that need my attention and I’ll come back to this and try to answer questions and add more sources as best as I can. For those of you calling me a “douche” and saying I’m wrong... I apologize for not citing sources originally and I will come back and add better ones (or if anyone wants to help me out and add some in the comments, that would be awesome).

Edit #2 for everyone calling me a “pussy” and a “wuss” because “it doesn’t hurt the environment” - The way I learned about this for the first time was when I was hiking Angel’s Landing in Zion National Park, a ranger was picking up orange peels and started walking with us and telling us about the California Condor and how hard they are working on getting their population up (from being nearly extinct). The Condors will eat the orange peels and the peels can kill them. The peels attract other animals and birds and wildlife that wouldn’t normally frequent a certain area will start to rely on that area for their food. It’s definitely not something that just sucks to look at.

I’m a 5’2”, 120lb woman and I hike a shit ton in the backcountry as well as popular/heavy trafficked trails. If carrying extra weight off of a difficult trail makes me a “pussy” then I guess i’m a pussy.
