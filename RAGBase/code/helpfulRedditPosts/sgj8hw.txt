LPT: To greatly reduce stress in your life, if someone is wrong on the internet, type out your response to get it out of your system, then erase it and don't post it. The arguments are never worth it.

Arguing on the internet is like a diarrhea balloon fight. There's no good outcome for anyone. It's okay to let people be wrong on the internet.

EDIT: While several people somehow think they'll save the world by "educating" people who have no desire to be educated, it seems the vast majority of you get it. This is refreshing. Of course, one could say "fire can burn you" and people would find a way to refute it on here. Sigh...

EDIT 2: People keep saying things like "If I can change just one mind..." You know, if you speak to thousands of people in a few months and only change one mind, that's an abysmal ROI. If I were an investor and wanted results, I would not back you. Maybe consider more effective options if you truly care about making things better. Hint: It might involve actual work.
