Edota 3: Thanks for the gold kind stranger

Actual real edit this time:

How the fuck do so many of you claim to not have ONE fucking day where you don't have anything planned that you MUST DO? Live a little for crying out loud. Doing nothing productive is good sometimes. And I mean, if you take so much pleasure in having your life sectioned into doing so many things on your days off, good for you, but don't bring your negativity unto people who enjoy the pleasure of looking at the fucking sky all day and think about nothing
