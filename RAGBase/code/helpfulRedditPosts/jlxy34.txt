title:
YSK That dull knives are far more dangerous than sharp knives.

content:
“How would a sharp knife be safer than a dull one? Wouldn’t it cut you easily?” You may ask. That is the truth, however you should know that most accidents in the kitchen are a result of a dull knife. 

Why YSK: With a sharp knife you don’t need to work hard to cut. You apply minimal pressure and the knife does the rest. You have full control of the blade, however, if you are using a dull knife, you are forced to apply much more pressure, and the heavier you push, the less control you have meaning when pushing hard when using a dull knife you are much more likely to lose control and stab yourself full force in the hand because you couldn’t stop the knife in time when it slipped. With a sharp knife you require very little force, and as a result have much greater control over what you are doing making cutting with a sharp knife much safer than cutting using a dull one.


u/Amonette2012 Also makes a very good point here in explaining how you're more conscious and careful when handling a sharp knife.

&gt;Also with a sharp knife, you are less likely to think 'this is fine for getting ice cream out of the carton with' and stab yourself in the hand.
