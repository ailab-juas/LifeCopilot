LPT: Never make a career decision based on your loyalty to a company.

content:
Corporations have absolutely zero loyalty to you.

You can work at the same company for 20 years, survive all sorts of mergers and acquisitions, and be close enough with your boss that you go their kids' weddings.

The instant an opportunity comes up in which it is financially advantageous for the company to outsource or contract your position, they will "make a business decision," and your job will go to the lowest bidder.

If you shop around and get an offer at another company that pays better or has significantly greater advancement opportunities, take it.  Don't let yourself become too comfortable in one position for too long, because ultimately you're expendable.
