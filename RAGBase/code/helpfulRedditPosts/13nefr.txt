LPT: How to help someone out without being taken advantage of

content:
I was just explaining this to a friend today; figured I should share it with a wider audience.

There's the old saying, "You can't help someone who won't help themselves", well this tip takes that a bit further "Don't help someone who won't help themselves"

If you're a helpful person, chances are you find yourself always with a promise to keep, and some people may in fact be taking advantage of the fact that you will always be available for them.

**Protip: Whenever someone asks you for some kind of favour, create a little hurdle for them to do in order to redeem the favour.**  
If they're not willing to cross the hurdle, then what they needed from you was clearly not important enough for them.

For example, if a family member needs tech support for their computer, rather than drop everything and go around to help them - I'll ask them to deliver the computer to me at work. If it's not that important for them, they won't be bothered to bring it to me and I won't have spent my time and resources on it.  
If it's really important enough for them, then they'll do it and I'll happily fix it for them at that point. 

Sometimes it's as simple as 'Write me an email with all the details, and I will follow it up from there'.

You get to continue to be that helpful person, and you won't end up wasting your time on things that aren't that necessary.
