LPT: If you have room in your freezer, fill it with containers of water

content:
Freezers work best when full. If you don't keep your freezer fully stocked, fill up available room with large containers of water. Leave some room around the fan area, but otherwise try to fill it up as much as possible. 

This will cut down on your electric bill since the freezer won't have to work as hard (after the initial freeze), and if there's ever a power outage, will keep items colder for longer.
