YSK asking "How are you feeling?" is a much more open-ended question that's not as accusatory or intimidating as "What's wrong?"

content:
When you ask someone "what's wrong?" it puts them in a position that doesn't encourage conversation or doesn't encourage honesty. It gives them an easy way to say "Nothing" or to shrug you off.

Meanwhile, asking someone "how are you feeling?" will be much more open-ended, is more welcoming, caring and much more likely to lead to an honest answer.

This is especially true in relationships when your S/O is withholding why they're upset or the fact of whether or not they're actually upset.

Edit: People, this is not a cure-all. How they respond will always ultimately be up to them. I didn't provide magical words - just a better way to see what may be troubling someone.

If they don't want to tell you, it doesn't matter how you ask them...
