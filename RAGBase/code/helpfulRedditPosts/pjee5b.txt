LPT: The more items on a restaurant menu, the less fresh the food usually is going to be.

Sorry for the confusion. I was trying to say that certain restaurants where I live have many different types of food and don't focus on one type of dish. I know that Mexican and Asian restaurants can use the same 15 ingredients in many different dishes, but some places just reheat a lot of their food, making it mediocre, even disgusting.
