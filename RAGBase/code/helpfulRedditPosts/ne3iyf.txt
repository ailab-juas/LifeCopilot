LPT Always remove your prescription medications, keys, lithium batteries from your checked bags when flying.

I work for an airline and fly for a living.  When checking a bag always remove critical medications, keys and lithium batteries from the bag and have them in your carry on.  Also have a couple days of clothes in your carry on as well.  While they try not to delay your bag it occasionally happens.  If your critical meds or keys are in the checked bag, you’re without the meds or no way to get home.  TSA doesn’t mind if you’re carrying needles and liquid if it’s prescribed through security (I do it all the time).  

Lithium batteries are unstable if damaged or something stuck in the ends and can have a thermal runaway.  In the hold below we have no way of putting it out.  In the cabin, we have extinguishers and special fireproof battery bags to place them in if something happens.

Edit-  Thank you for all the awards and great discussions, I’m glad this helps.  We have lots of tips from traveling all the time.
