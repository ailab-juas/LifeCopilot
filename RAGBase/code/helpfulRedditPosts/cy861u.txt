LPT: Want to read a book of Shakespeare but don't want the hassle of the older English? Try out No Sweat Shakespeare (website) where all the books are translated into modern English for free.

Not sponsored but I wish I was. Helped me so much during my English exams. When I say 'modern english' I don't mean cool trendy meme speak or whatever, it's more of a mix between actual words in the dictionary we use nowadays mixed with some Shakesperian. This should obviously only be a stepping stone before you read the originals proper. There's also No Fear Shakespeare too. 

EDIT: To all the people whining that 'ohh you aren't appreciating the language it was written in and you have to find beauty in the words it's so disgusting in modern english' please do kindly bugger off. Giving people who are less confident with the English language a crutch and a starting point, whether that be if they're simply not as skilled or that it isn't their first language is NEVER a bad thing. I've seen a lot of people also saying 'just use an annotated version' too and whilst that does work, I'd much rather just have all the annotations pre packaged into an extract rather than constantly having to take myself out of the scene to glance away at what any given word means.

EDIT 2: Alex please go away
