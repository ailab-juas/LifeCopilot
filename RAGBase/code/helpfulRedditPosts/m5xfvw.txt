LPT - If your employer is insistent that you never discuss your salary with anyone else, that is a red flag

content:
I knew this, but I took the job anyway. It was, and still is an indication that my boss knows he underpays people, and that's why he doesn't want anyone talking to each other about it.   


I am head of my department. I make about $10k less than I did at the job I left, and I know the industry averages and I know I am significantly underpaid. However... The opportunity has room for growth and if nothing else, its a stepstone to something better. I'm at peace with it.   


However, for anyone who finds themselves in a salary negotiation with someone who is really shifty or hush-hush about discussing your salary with other employees, know that he is screwing them, and possibly you and he knows full well that he should be paying you more.   


There is a great "[Adam Ruins Everything](https://youtu.be/7xH7eGFuSYI)" about this actually, and its pretty eye opening. Seems obvious after you watch it but.... its really not. People think discussing salaries is tacky or should be a private matter, but the only way people get paid what they deserve is when they know what people in similar positions at the company are making, and compare that to the industry average.
