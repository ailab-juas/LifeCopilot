title:
YSK To film yourself spending time with a dear one.

content:
Why YSK: I lost my son earlier this month, the one thing i wish i did was just video some of my time with him. like talking or playing games with him and such. I only have 2 recent videos of me just talking with him and that's what I miss the most. A group im in feels the same, the thing we miss the most with people who are gone is just sitting and spending time with them. So hangout with someone and just video it, because you never know when someone will go.
