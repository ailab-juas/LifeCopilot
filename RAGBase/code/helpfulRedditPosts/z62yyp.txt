LPT if you struggle with depression or other disorders preventing ADLs, you don't have to eat a full meal or even get into the shower in order to have tiny successes.

No, it's not healthy to do either of these long term or frequently, but sometimes it's better than nothing 

You should try to eat at least once a day. But if the idea of food in general makes you feel sick, but you know you can handle a bite of a comfort food like pickles or a candy bar, go for that. Likewise to if you realize you haven't drank anything for quite awhile, but don't feel thirsty or are apathetic about it, try a gulp or two of soda or tea, whatever liquid you can stomach. This is better than nothing and may drive your thirst for actual water up.

Lastly, I know showering can become a huge burden sometimes, and even in my worst times, I rationally knew just getting under the water would make me feel better, even if I didn't wash, just the water itself would. But in those times, I couldn't bring myself to do even that. 
Baby wipes, and if you feel up to it, baby powder, make for great odor blockers and can help you feel tons better than before.
