LTP: Back to School

content:
I went to college for an entire decade to get a doctorate and I am now a college professor at a major university. I feel I have learned a few things about being in and around university life. Here are my best tips. Feel free to add your own.

**Class schedule:**

One of the most important things needed in order to be successful in college life is to have your schedule set in the way that will be most beneficial to your lifestyle. Have trouble getting up in the mornings? DO NOT schedule an 8:00 am class; don't fool yourself into thinking that you will start getting up this semester. The reason universities offer classes at varying times is to allow students with different lifestyles to be successful. Sometimes, however, certain classes (especially courses within a major) are only offered at one time.

Look up where your classes are. Make sure that you have time in between classes to travel, eat lunch, and have some personal time. Don't pack all your classes back to back. Many freshmen in college do this since that is the way they have done school their entire lives. College is different. Give yourself some time in between classes.

Schedule in time to workout, eat, study/do homework, and personal time. This is often neglected. Once you get busy, all the things that you plan on doing "when I have time" will not happen. Put them in your planner/calendar.

Diligently use the calendar app on your phone/iPod/tablet/computer or buy a calendar book. Write down your classes and assignments. Write down social engagements as well. You may have been able to remember everything in high school, but there will come a time where your brain is so full that you simply can't remember everything. Write it down!

**Food**

If you are living in dorms and eating dorm food, try new things. Understand that not everything will be mind-blowing, but some things will work well for you. For example: Is it better for you/your body to just have cereal, fruit, and a yogurt for breakfast instead of waiting in the hot food line and getting sausage, bacon, pancakes, etc every morning.

If you live off campus and will be buying your own groceries: make sure to make regular trips to the grocery store. Don't be caught without food, forcing you to get fast food. This seems convenient, but is less healthy and is much more expensive than buying groceries. If you will be on campus all day, make a sandwich and take it with you. This isn't as exciting as getting food out, but you will save hundreds of dollars a year with just a little planning.

**Parking**

Parking on campus can be very, very expensive. Learn where the free places to park are. There are often places only a few blocks away where you can park on the street for free. Be willing to walk a few blocks or take a bus in order to save a lot of money. Parking where I teach costs close to $400 per year if you buy the campus pass. I found a free place to park and I take the bus into campus. It takes me about ten more minutes each way, but saving $400 is worth twenty minutes a day. I use this time to do some reading on my Kindle or answer emails on my phone.

**Bathrooms**

Every campus has good bathrooms and bad bathrooms. The bad bathrooms are usually in the dorms and close to class rooms. The good bathrooms are by administrative offices and offices that bring in lots of guests, such as the International Student Center. Explore. Find the best bathrooms; you'll be glad you did.

Carry a little toilet paper or wipes with you. Not all toilet paper is created equally. Campus toilet paper is some of the worst TP on the planet. I'm not even sure how it qualifies as TP.

**Quarters**

Quarters are one of the most prized commodities in university life. You'll need them for laundry, vending machines, parking, photocopies, and playing quarters (do people still play quarters?!)

**Try New Things**

The first couple weeks of college are very exciting - you meet new people, you are in a new place, and you learn new things. After the first month most people settle into a pattern. Buck this trend and keep things exciting by doing one thing a week you don't normally do. Eat somewhere new - try local places; go to a concert, dance performance, or play (these are often free on campus; go to the theater on campus (if there is one) and see an art film; go to a sporting event of a sport you don't normally watch. Try new things all the time. You may be surprised with what you enjoy.

**Professors**

Professors are generally intelligent people. Don't try to bullshit them. Be honest. Instead of fabricating some story about why you missed a test, be honest. I would rather have a students say "I screwed up and forgot," than making something up. I am more apt to give honest students a second chance that those that I feel are trying to slip one by me.

Get to know your professors. Visit them during office hours if you need help. You may feel like you don't want to bother them, but believe it or not, most professors got into the profession because they want to see people interested in the same subject they are interested in.

Get to know your professors, but keep a healthy professional relationship. Do not call their cell phone or text them. Only use their official university email and office phones.

**Roommates**

Communicate about schedules before school starts. There is nothing worse that waking up for the first day of classes and have someone be in the shower when you need it. Try to have a good idea of their schedule so that you don't step on each other's toes.

Clean up after yourself. Most roommate trouble starts with dishes left around the apartment or in the sink. Take a few seconds to clean up after yourself; it goes a long way.

Do something unexpected for your roommates once a month. Cook them a meal, pick up something at the grocery store because you know they like it, etc. 

**Common Campus Courtesies**

Take off your headphones when people are talking to you.

Open a door for someone.

Keep your head up and smile at those around you. Too many students walk around with their head pointed at the ground.

Please, for the love of all that is holy, let people off the bus before you get on.

Help someone that needs help in a class.

Help someone that is handicapped - open a door, carry books, etc. 

Throw your garbage in the garbage can and recycle when possible. It's your campus and your home for the next several years.

These are just a few thoughts. Please leave your own in the comments. Good luck going back to school!

**EDIT:**

**Textbooks**

DO NOT buy textbooks at the university bookstore if possible. Try the local competitor or Amazon. 

Take classes with a roommate and split the cost of a book.

Check to see if the library has your text. I found this out my junior year of undergrad. The library had a copy of every class I took. I was the first to check the book out (a week or two before classes) and kept renewing the book throughout the semester.

**EDIT 2:**

I know I got the acronym wrong. Thanks to the eighty people that pointed it out.

**EDIT 3**

Forgot a big one. Change your sheets every week. If you are expecting "company," change them that day.

**EDIT 4**

Several responses have been along the line of "LPT: Don't go to college." I think we can be more accepting than that. May I propose a new method of thinking when it comes to education?

Get the education you need for the career you want.

If this means medical school, then do it. If this means enlist in the army, don't go to college. If this means you want to be a college professor, grad school it is. Have the courage to try to live your dream. College/university isn't for everyone, but for those with specific goals in mind (that would be benefitted by a college degree), go to school and work hard.
