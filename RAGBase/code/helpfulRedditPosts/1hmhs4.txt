LPT: Putting off going back to gym after short or long layoff? Tell yourself you're just going to do a half-workout.

content:
Sometimes it's difficult to get motivated to go back even say after a week. That's because in your mind you think of a full-on workout and don't feel up to it. 
Let yourself off the hook, say to yourself- I'll just do half a workout.
That's pretty easy. Half the distance on a treadmill, or half the number of sets that you usually do, or half the number of reps.
That gets the blood flowing and eases you back into working out.
(generally you'll find when the pressure's off, you may even do a little more.)
