LPT: Support the USPS by returning all 1st class junk mail with return envelopes back to the sender. The sender must pay for it to be returned, thus the USPS is paid twice for it.

All first class mail that includes a return envelope can be filled with your other junk mail and sent to the sender. Support the USPS and get rid of that awful waste of paper with a purpose!
