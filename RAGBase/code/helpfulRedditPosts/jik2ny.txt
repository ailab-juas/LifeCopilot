LPT: If you are job hunter its always worth applying for the unpaid internships that you see.

content:
Not to take the job but to get interview experience whilst also wasting the time of these companies that have the nerve to employ people this way. Having interview experience will help you in manys ways when job hunting, especially in how you answer questions (and how you react to the odd weird question you may face). If they give you the 'job' you can simply say you have taken a paid role elsewhere.

You will feel much more prepared and confident when you go for that real job!
