YSK Neckpain, backache, headaches, poor sleep and general pain can have nothing to do with your mattress or pillow. You might be clenching or grinding your teeth in your sleep.

content:
Why YSK: Most people will grind their teeth at some point and it can cause years of horrible nights sleep, random neck pain, back pain, stress and headaches. (When you known can save you a fortune on pillows, mattresses and chiropractors)

As a stopgap solution a simple nightguard can help, but the teeth grinding is usually caused by an emotional trigger such as stress or anxiety. Not your pillow or mattress...
