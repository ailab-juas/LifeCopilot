LPT: Living alone? Avoid mess, pests, smell and washing dishes - with one simple tip.

content:
Train yourself to only use one piece of crockery (a plate and a bowl),  one piece of cutlery (a spoon, a knife, a fork) and one mug and drinking glass. Then either you wash them straight after use, or you're forced to clean them before use.

This might sound obvious and not worthy of being a 'pro tip' in theory; but in reality it's a practice that's difficult to execute at first, as when you're hungry or thirsty it's too easy to take the easy-option, but if you train your self to observe the rule, it becomes genius.

We fall into grooves living with others, of always getting a new plate, or a new bowl out of the cupboard every single time. When living alone with no-one to wash the dishes to appease, we get sloppy and let things pile up until we're forced to tidy and clean; this can lead to catastrophe, cockroaches love dat standing water...

If when living alone you stick by the rule that the plate you use is the only plate you use, and the fork and spoon that you eat with are your only mistresses, you save your self so much fucking hassle. Also if you're living in shared accommodation, think of how many arguments this would get you out of!

So yeah, simple, but ridiculously game changing.
