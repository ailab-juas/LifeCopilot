YSK that there is a CDC page dedicated to male victims of sexual and domestic assault/abuse. If you are one of the many male victims out there, this page has resources and information that may help you find solace and understanding

Why YSK: If you are a male victim of sexual violence such as myself, you may find solace in the information and help through the resources given here. Is critical that you get the help you need and remember that it is NEVER your fault.

Edit: I am overwhelmed by the replies from so many of you. You are all so brave. u/p0tat0p0tat0 graciously pointed out the advocacy group “1in6” which has a [24 hour hotline](https://1in6.org/helpline/) for anyone who needs help.
