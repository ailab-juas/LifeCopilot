LPT: when walking up and down stairs with a small child, always count them. Theyâ€™ll learn to count so quickly.

My son turns 3 around thanksgiving and can count to 15 and always counts even on his own when going up and down stairs. 

I did this with all my kids. We now do the alphabet and he can get to F.
