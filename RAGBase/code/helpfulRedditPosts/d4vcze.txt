YSK When going to buy something from a salesperson, don’t tell them your actual job title.

content:
I’ve worked in the car industry (no longer thank god) But my parents have for years.

But personal experience? My husband went to Men’s Wearhouse to buy a suit. The first thing the salesman asked is what his job title was. His job isn’t glamorous. It pays well enough, but not enough for us to spend frivolously or to spend whenever we want. We budget stringently because I currently stay at home with our daughter (I start a job next Monday though!! ...anyway). My husband told the salesman he’s a field engineer. This guys eyes lit up and took us right over to the $1000 suits. Given, a nice suit would cost that much AT LEAST. But he just needed a quick suit. The guy thought he had a sale in the bag. He wouldn’t show us anything cheaper even after we asked. We went to Kohl’s across the street and bought the best fitting suit for $100.

Car salesman also do this. If you have any “fancy” sounding job name, tell them you work for Walmart. Seriously. They’ll do they’re best to make the sale and keep it in your budget. The minute they hear “engineer”, “IT”, “medical field”, or anything if that nature, they’ll try to upsell you the most they can.
