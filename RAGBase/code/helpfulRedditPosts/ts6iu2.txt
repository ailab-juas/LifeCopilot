LPT: Problem with foxes

content:
If you have a fox problem( stealing chickens), and you want to get rid of them without killng them, do this.
Boil a few litres of water with several garlic pieces and hot chilli peppers, let it cool down and spray the fences with a windex or plate detergent bottle. 
If it rains, give it another spray.

Foxes have a sensitive nose, and cannot stand the smell of garlic, will feel nausea and will definetely leave the grounds.
