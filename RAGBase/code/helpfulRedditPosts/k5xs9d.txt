LPT: If you ever want to give an employee an obscenely large tip, instead of writing it on the credit slip, use cash or Venmo etc. This will prevent the restaurant/establishment from claiming ownership and you can be sure the employee gets it.

During the pandemic, I have heard of multiple instances of a guest’s generosity being thwarted by a greedy restaurant. A guests wants to help an industry employee during this unsure time in our careers, and the establishment says “nope! That’s ours.”

Although there are laws to prevent this (at least in my state) it’s easier to save everyone the headache and cut out the middle man, and give it straight to the employee. It would be terrible for a good deed to be ruined through someone else’s greed.

Edit: to clarify, the employee receiving a generous tip should absolutely consider sharing the wealth and ABSOLUTELY MUST still be tipping out their coworkers. This advice is for a guest who wants to make sure their server actually sees that money at all.

Edit 2: for anyone curious as to my state’s laws on tips (since I refer to them a lot) I found a link that has a quick summary or what an employer can and can’t do in MN
