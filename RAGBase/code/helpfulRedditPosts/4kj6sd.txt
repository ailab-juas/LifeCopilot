LPT: If a foreign airline asks you whether you'd like to book in your currency or theirs, double check the exchange rate.

I booked an Aer Lingus flight that offered me Dollars or Euros.  Their effective exchange rate came out to 1.17 Dollars / Euro, when the current exchange rate was 1.12.  So by opening another browser tab and checking, I saved $50 on an $850 flight that they were trying to squeeze out of me.

It's worth noting that my credit card charged something like a $7 fee for the transaction.  Something else to consider.
