LPT: Let cats sniff your hand before trying to stroke them.

content:
Cats rely on scenta lot and if you smell safe then they're likely to let you stroke them.

EDIT: Ok so first of all,thank you for all of the comments and I'm sorry that I can't respond to all of them.

Secondly to add a couple of points which other people have mentioned down in the comments: a lot of the same rules apply to other animals that are not cats, crouching down to a similar level as the cat can make you seem less threatening, holding an open palm can show that you are not hiding anything, and also avoiding eye contact (making eye contact with animals is often a sign of distrust).

Ok this is getting long so I'll stop.
