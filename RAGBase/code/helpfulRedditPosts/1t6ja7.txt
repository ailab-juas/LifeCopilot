LPT: Thirsty and about to drink a good drink? Slam down a glass of water first so you can enjoy it.

content:
I only have a quart of eggnog in my fridge, and you can imagine I can go through that pretty fast. By drinking a glass of water first, I can pour myself a glass and not go through it as quickly since I'm not as thirsty. Also, I drink more water this way and stay hydrated.

Edit: Holy fuck guys. I've said it multiple times in the comments. I wasn't going to drink the eggnog to quench my thirst. I didn't want to gulp it down in hopes to quench my thirst, so THAT'S WHY I DRANK THE WATER FIRST.
