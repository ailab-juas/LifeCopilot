YSK about the 'check in' tool if you are having trouble with whatever you are currently feeling.

content:
If you are feeling anxious, nervous, or any other feelings that you may have trouble expressing, one tool that can be used is called the "check in" and it goes like this:

I'm feeling/was feeling \_\_\_\_\_ (make sure this is an actual emotion, not a belief. For example saying "I feel hurt" is different from saying "I feel like you attacked me".)

I feel this way when \_\_\_\_\_ happens (this part is the objective trigger, key word "objective". To stay with the above example, saying "you called me a liar" is much different from saying "you attacked me".)

I feel this way because I believe \_\_\_\_\_ (this is part is the subjective trigger. Here it's acceptable to say something like "I believe your intention was to attack and hurt me", but be sure to stay clear that this is your perception, not something objective.)

what I notice in my body is \_\_\_\_\_ (what are the sensations in your body that tell you you're feeling the way you do?)

I choose to respond by \_\_\_\_\_

\--------------------------------------------------------

To give you an example:

I am feeling nervous and hopeful.

I feel this way when I share an explanation of the check-in format.

I feel this way because I think my words may not be effective or helpful. However, I also think that I have a responsibility to share ideas that may help people fix their problems even when their lives are largely out of my control.

What I notice in my body is shallow breathing and a bright energetic sensation in my chest and throat.

I choose to respond by letting go of my attachment to other people's actions and just share the idea.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Of course, nobody really expresses themselves exactly like that. But any thorough discussion about your feelings will have those elements in some form or another. The check in is also helpful if you just want to work out exactly how you're feeling. And nobody even has to know that you're doing it. Self-awareness is critical for good communication.

I encountered this tip a while ago and I've been using it ever since. Hope it can help you out as well. =)
