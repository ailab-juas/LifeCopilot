YSK that VLC has an extension that can automatically find the right subtitle for you

content:
Do this by installing the extension here:

https://github.com/exebetche/vlsub/

How to use it:

&gt;- Start Vlc
- Start your video
- Click on the menu View &gt; VLSub or VLC &gt; Extension &gt; VLSub on Mac OS X
- Click on "Search by hash" or "Search by name"
- Select a subtitles file on the list
- Click on "Download selection"
That's it, the subtitles should appear on your video.

&gt;If you're not happy with your subtitles (wrong sync etc), you can select an other one and click "Download" again, that will erase the previous one and load it automatically.

Edit: If you have VLC 2.2 installed, it should already be there. Just go to to View &gt; VLSub
