YSK: iOS 15 lets you copy and paste text from photos. It’s perfect for “scanning” recipes out of cookbooks, handwritten notes, etc.

[Here’s how you do it](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/09/29/ios-15-live-text-how-to-copy-and-paste-text-from-a-photo.html). It’s a pretty awesome feature that most people don’t know exists. Basically, a photo of anything that is written down, either printed or handwritten (within reason) can have the text extracted from the image. 

Why YSK: this could save someone a lot of time and effort if they needed to create a searchable database for recipes, notes, etc.

edit: yes, androids can also do the same thing.

edit #2: iPhone XS/XR and newer are capable of doing it (but older models can use Google Lens in the Google app for a comparable effect).
