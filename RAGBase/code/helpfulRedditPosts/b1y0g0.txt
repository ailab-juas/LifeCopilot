YSK that if you need help affording medications, many pharmaceutical companies have prescription assistance programs where you may be able get meds for free or at a significant discount if you qualify

The website [Needy Meds](https://www.needymeds.org/pap) is a great place to start. You can search by brand name, generic drug name or manufacturer. 

*Disclosure- I used to work for the assistance program for a biologics manufacturer. The upper income limit for one of the drug programs I worked on was over $100K (you could earn that much and still receive assistance if other qualifications met).
