LPT: If night time thoughts are keeping you awake, write them all down

content:
I found that if I'm lying awake thinking of things, whether it be what I need to do the next day, or having a fake argument in my head, writing it down helps me clear my mind and helps me settle down to sleep. That's kind of why I'm writing this now, I wrote some ideas for tomorrow down, thought "Ooh, that could be a cool LPT" and the thought wouldn't go away until I did it!
