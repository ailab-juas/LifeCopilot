LPT: Beat procrastination by realizing that you’re never going to FEEL like doing the task. We often think we’ll be more open to doing the task sometime in the future (such as tomorrow), when in reality, we’re going to feel the same resistance then as well. Also, just get STARTED.

I’ve struggled with procrastination all my life. Recently I’ve been learning about different strategies to help improve my struggle. There’s an old podcast called iProcrastinate (no longer making episodes, but still available) where a professor of psychology who studies procrastination explores the topic in depth.

There are a lot of wonderful strategies Dr. Pychyl recommends. The two that I’ve found to be the most helpful are:

1) It’s not about how you “feel.” You’re never going to feel like doing the task you’re avoiding due to it being boring, difficult, confusing, etc. Stop waiting for the day when you have less resistance to the task. It’s not going to happen. Accept that you have resistance to the task and begin working on it anyway. Oftentimes you’ll find that it wasn’t as bad as your mind made it out to be.

2) Just start. Even it means setting a timer for 5 minutes and just committing that amount of time toward it. You’ll gain some momentum. And again, you may even find out that the task isn’t as daunting as your mind told you it was. Take action!
