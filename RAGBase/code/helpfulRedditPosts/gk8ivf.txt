LPT: If you are ever digging in your garden or yard and you suddenly hit sand, there is a high chance that there is a cable buried underneath.

content:
Sand is like a universal «Be careful, there is something underneath.» warning message, so if you suddenly stumble upon sand while digging in your garden/yard, you should proceed with extreme caution.

Edit:  
It seems like people are misunderstanding what I am saying. I am not saying that if there is a cable under the ground it will be covered in sand. I am saying that if you hit sand whilst digging (and it's out of place) then there is likely something underneath it.

You should **always** check for cables *before* digging.
