title:
[LPT] Never bury a fire with sand on a beach. It’ll stay hot and someone could step in it.

content:
With winter coming up, a lot of people flock to warmer areas. it’s still cold so we have fires. BUT Every year people go to the ER with burns because they stepped into a buried “fire pit” that someone covered up on the beach by throwing sand on top. 

Don’t be the cause of a burn. DO Extinguish your fire but don’t cover it up with sand. It sounds ridiculous but sand buried fire sites can stay hot for a while. If you must start a fire, just leave the site ‘as is’ after extinguished.
