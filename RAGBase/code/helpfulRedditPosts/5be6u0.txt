title:
If you think highly of someone, tell them.

content:
I've experienced it too many times that I find out someone genuinely respects me and looks up to me when they're introducing me to someone else. I've caught myself doing this to other people I think highly of as well.

All it takes is one sentence, but it can change everything for that person (or just make their day). It's really not that hard. Do it!
