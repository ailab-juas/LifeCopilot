LPT: Have a friend call your references on your resume before using them as references.

content:
Pretty straight forward. I've hired around 60 people a year for the last 4 years, and you would not believe how many bad references I get. Obviously if someone gives a bad reference, you are pretty much disqualified for the job.

So before you even consider putting them on your resume, have a friend call and ask for a reference to find out what past employers really think about you. Some people are assholes.
