title:
YSK that if you're going to invite someone who menstruates to your home, they'll be more comfortable if you have a wastebasket, hand soap, and a box of tissues in your bathroom. (Especially if you're in a sexual relationship with them!)

content:
There are two main reasons here, and there are probably more!  

- Many people like to freshen up before sexual activities to feel more comfortable and confident 

- People who menstruate may need to dispose of sanitary items, and being able to do so privately can be very important to them

I think many people focus on hospitality when hosting a guest, such as having snacks and drinks available...  I definitely appreciate when the house I'm visiting has a well-stocked bathroom!
