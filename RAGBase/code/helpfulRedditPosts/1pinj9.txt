LPT: To swallow large pills easier, use a banana.

content:
Swallowing large pills (or any pills if you don't like taking pills) is much easier if you use something thicker than water. A milkshake, applesauce, icecream, anything like that works. But banana works the best. Take a bite. Chew it up. Pop the pill in and swallow. You can't even feel the pill.
