LPT: Take notes when calling customer service

content:
I work customer service over the phone and I hear "I spoke with someone the other day" a lot and few customers are ever able to tell me the name of who they spoke to, and oftentimes can't even get the day right. We don't have a universal system that tracks calls, and even if we did not knowing this information leaves it up to us to do our job well (and there are a lot of customer service people who just don't care). 

At work I take notes about every call (name, time, account/policy/whatever #s, what we discussed) and as a customer I have started to do the same in a little notebook I set aside for that purpose. When I recently called my insurance company and was able to tell them exactly who I spoke to and when it lead to a quick transfer, the woman apologizing, and her promising to personally make sure my issue was resolved. What could easily have taken 15+ minutes (a lot longer if put on hold) had I started over took a couple, and it got me someone who was motivated to take care of me.

It also feels better to have your shit in order rather than helplessly hope maybe eventually someone will do things right. And from the other end I appreciate customers who meet me partway and demonstrate a constructive interest in getting things resolved (since all I really want is to get your issue resolved and off my plate).

If they answer the phone "Hello this is bnyudgcjkg" (which happens so often I think it is a tactic to avoid giving out their name) politely ask them to repeat their name. And if you get a direct phone# you better not lose that. Those things are golden.
