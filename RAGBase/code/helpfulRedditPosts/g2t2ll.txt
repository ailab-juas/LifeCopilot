YSK: Scammers are trying harder than ever to get into your secured accounts.

content:
I don't usually have trouble with scammer / BS emails, but today I had 2 separate emails from "legitimate" looking senders telling me I needed to log in to update security on both my Apple and PayPal accounts.
I didn't click the link on either, and neither should you, so I don't know what happens after.
I will try to post pics so you can see what a phony email address looks like no matter how good the actual email looks.
