LPT: Confirmation bias is real for everyone. Be aware of your own bias and seek your news from more neutral sources. Your daily stress and anxiety levels will drop a lot.

I used to criticize my in-laws for only getting their news from Fox News. Then I realized that although I read news from several sources, most were left leaning. I have since downloaded AP and Reuterâ€™s apps and now use them for news (no more reddit news) and my anxiety and stress levels have dropped significantly.

Take a look at where you get your news and make sure it is a neutral source, not one that reinforces your existing biases.
