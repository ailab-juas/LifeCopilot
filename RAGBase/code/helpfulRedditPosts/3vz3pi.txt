LPT: Food is an easy way to make friends and build relationships.

content:
Everyone eats. If you are interested in being friends with someone, offer to feed them. Bring donuts to class or work, invite them over for food, invite them out for food. It also offers a talking point so you aren't awkward right off. 

Disclaimer: not useful if trying to make friends at an eating disorder support group or anything of the like.
