title:
Test your mechanic's honesty: ask for advice on known good item

From /u/Rex8ever in /r/AskReddit: 
&gt; I don't know a ton about cars, so I keep meticulous records. If I think a mechanic is bullshitting me, I just pick the last thing I replaced and tell them I'm concerned about it.

If you're getting stuff checked out, and you suspect your mechanic of bullshitting you, ask about an item you've just had replaced.  Wiper blades are a really cheap and easy item to swap, if nothing significant has been replaced recently, though I'll take other suggestions in comments.
