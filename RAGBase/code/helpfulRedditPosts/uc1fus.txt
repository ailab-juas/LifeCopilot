YSK that participating in guerilla gardening can be more dangerous to the environment than beneficial.

content:
If you want to take part of the trend of making "seed bombs" or sprinkling wildflowers in places that you have no legal ownership of, you need to do adequate research to make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you aren't spreading an invasive species of plant. You can ruin land (and on/near the right farm, a person's livelihood) by spreading something that shouldn't be there. 

Why YSK: There has been a rise in the trend of guerilla gardening and it's easy to think that it's a harmless, beautifying action when you're spreading greenery. However, the "harmless" introduction of plants has led to the destruction of our remaining prairies, forests, and other habitats. The spread of certain weeds--some of which have beautiful flowers-- have taken a toll on farmers and have become nearly impossible to deal with. Once some invasive species takes hold, it can have devastating and irreversible effects. 

PLEASE, BE GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR EARTH.
