title:
LPT: if you challenge your boss's authority in important things, DO NOT challenge them for the small stuff, no matter how dumb

content:
Your boss's impression of control/authority is probably a good part of their ego, if pride or conscience put you in conflict with your boss, throw them a bone as often as you can.

Not doing that will result in missed opportunity, lower priority for raises, and less influence overall.
