LPT: Use one set of hand warmers all week long

content:
Do you live in the US or Canada? Are you just now realizing that your gloves are not suited for the end-of-days coldness that we're currently dealing with? Buy a few sets of hand warmers and put them in your gloves every time you go outside. They work because they're made of small bits of iron that oxidize and give off heat when exposed to air. If you keep a plastic ziploc bag in your coat pocket, you can put the hand warmers in there after your commute and the reaction will stop, allowing you to save them for the next time you go outside! Most hand warmers last for several hours so one set is enough to get me through an entire week of commuting to work (via walking).

Edit: phone spelling is hard.
