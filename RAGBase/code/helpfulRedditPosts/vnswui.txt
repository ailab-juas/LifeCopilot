LPT: If you have a cat that constantly focuses on one spot in the house get it checked out

content:
Cats can hear things that humans can't. If you notice a cat focusing on one spot get that spot checked out. It could be mice, rats, roaches, termites or even problems with the electrical wiring in the wall. It may prevent a fire or alert you to other hazards that are present.
