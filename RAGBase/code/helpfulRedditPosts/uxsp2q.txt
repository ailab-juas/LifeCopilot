YSK: Apple iPhones have started saving images as HEIC files, which are not easily readable on non-Apple devices. You can default to saving in 'more compatible' mode, which are familiar formats that work on most devices.

Why YSK: if you send an HEIC image from your iPhone, it may be unreadable unless the person on the other end has an Apple device. Windows devices [can't read HEIC without a paid extension](https://www.howtogeek.com/345504/how-to-open-heic-files-on-windows-or-convert-them-to-jpeg/) (*edit: see footnote*), so this can affect work, finance, and social activities.

There is a way to [revert to saving in more compatible formats](https://backlightblog.com/iphone-heic-to-jpg). (Go to Settings-&gt; Camera -&gt; Formats -&gt; Most Compatible). These images will be larger for the same image quality, but can be read without additional software on non-Apple devices.

HEIC has its advantages over JPG encoding and others, but they are ~~proprietary~~ *new and not widely implemented* and not readily usable on many devices. If compatibility is important to you (eg, in a Windows-dominated industry), you may consider changing the way your iPhone saves images.

edit: /u/ictsol linked [this package](https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/192715-how-obtain-free-hevc-heic-extensions-microsoft-store.html) which appears to be able to open HEIC files for free on Windows 10. Some people are reporting that Windows 11 can open them without additional software.

Also, the format is not proprietary to Apple as several articles said, but they were the first major adopter. Samsung, for example, has a setting to save in HEIF/HEIC.
