LPT: Don't cheap out on Shoes and Mattresses throughout life, most of the time one of the two are supporting the whole weight of your body and poor quality can result in negative health consequences.

content:
Shoes: Comfort, general foot health, posture and joints through posterior chain, reduced risk of accidents ie slips, trips. Of course you can buy good quality shoes at a reasonable cost, and conversely expensive high fashion shoes that may not be so comfortable, so quality/design is the main factor here. You get the gist.

Mattress: Posture, spinal health, quality of sleep, reduction in ache's and pains. A good quality mattress that's right for you can improve your quality of life so much, from the obvious physical aspects but also right down to your general mental health as a lack of quality sleep can be detrimental to so many facets of your general wellbeing.
