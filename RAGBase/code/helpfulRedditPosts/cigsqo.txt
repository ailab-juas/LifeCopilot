YSK: about Japanese barberry a commonly sold (for lawns ) invasive species that's has been shown to help spread Lyme's disease.

So Japanese barberry is a very common lawn decorations and is still sold at many stores like home Depot and such through the US. Here is a picture of the plant in it's more common purple variety :https://imgur.com/gallery/QtpfjGF and here is a pic of it as it's more natural green variety of which it normally goes back to once in the wild https://imgur.com/gallery/cciXfeO so I'm sure many of you have seen this plant and some of you even have this plant in your lawn.

Well you should know this species of plant is helping to spread Lyme's disease as it's leaves make a perfect microenvironment for black leg ticks(ones that transmit Lyme's) to develop. The leaves make it very humid which is something the ticks love and because of this the young are able grow in a safe environment. Additionally the thorns and thickness if this plant can protect the ticks from predators such as opossums and turkeys.  The bush can also offer refuge for white footed mice which are the main reservoir for Lyme's(much more important than deer or anything else)https://tickencounter.org/prevention/mouse_targeted_devices. The reason mice are important is the young ticks will normally feed in small animals like the mice for their first stage. That's where they pick up the Lyme's. After that they will bite others hosts and that's how they can spread it. 

Another reason to not buy this terrible plant is that it's a weed of a plant. If you go to a wild area where this has taken root, the bushes are everywhere. They grow to very large sizes and are extremely hard to remove. I've removed a lot of them myself and to make sure the plant doesn't just come back next year you have to remove every root and then make sure all the braches and such are off the ground because it will reroot from a branch. The plant takes a lot of effort to get ride of. Now this is important because many if not all states have an invasive species control group of some sort. Some are funded through the government and other are volunteering. These people face a huge work load they are almost always very under funded undermanned and trying their best to just prevent spread.  So this bush is bad because it's takes a lot of resources, because it's time consuming to remove and it has to be checked back on the following year to make sure it was done properly. 

So if you are a lawn owner I plead you to look up you local states "do not plant list"  help out your local invasive species removal group by just not making the problem any worse.  Also if you are willing please consider removing the plant from your yard(if present) and replacing it with a native plant. Most "do not plant " lists normally have a sister  please plant list so that should help you find information on responsible planting. 

For people who choose to remove please wear gloves. This plant has some nasty thorns that you won't feel at first but then the next day you will have some deep splinters that are painful and infected.



Here a scientific paper saying that these management of these bushes  reduced tick populations https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C33&amp;q=japanese+barberry+ticks&amp;oq=Japanese+barber#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3Dv4GGxsrMo3kJ

Also if you are a new jerseys resident or tri-state area, here is the NJ invasive species strike team app, a really useful guide for finding and reporting invasive plants and animals

Invasive are an ever increasing problem for our local wildlife, and if we want our future generations to enjoy the variety in nature we have then we need to protect it. Of even 5% of the population learned how to identify a couple invasives and just Removed them as they went about hikes and walking and such the problem would be much more managable. But a start is to prevent more people from planting these and acting as a source of invasion.

Edit: just realized this is kinda long so here is the 

TLDR: Japanese barberry is a invasive species in North America. This species has been shown to help ticks that spread Lyme's disease. This plant is also very commonly sold in most states. So please don't buy it and if you have it in your yard please remove it


Edit 2: if anyone actually removes a bush from their yard/decided to plant something else please comment that or let me know somehow. Would be awesome to know this post actually helped a bit

Edit3: fixed the green barberry link


Edit 4: realized I didn't post anything to help people actually I'd the plant. Here is a nice little youtube video that should help https://youtu.be/rljunkLVPD8
