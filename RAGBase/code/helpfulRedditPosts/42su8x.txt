title:
LPT: If you live in a region that experiences snow during the winter, find an empty parking lot and teach yourself how to "stunt" drift and regain control of your car. That way, when you slide in traffic, you'll know how to counter steer and when to brake. (Ask someone with experience to teach you).

Edit 1: JFC! Alright don't do it in an empty parking lot, find a designated track. 

Edit 2: Taught myself how to drift on a friends farm a while back. It *is* useful. Avoided an accident yesterday with a little hand-brake action. 

Edit 3: If you don't feel comfortable learning how to regain control of your car in the snow, stay home when in snows. Incompetent drivers (the people that panic and can't coordinate proper steering with acceleraton *or* braking) cause the most accidents in my city.
