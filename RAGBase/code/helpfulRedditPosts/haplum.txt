YSK: It is ok to cut family members out of your life. Don't be quilted into keeping toxic people around. Some family is not blood.

This is a hard one for me and for you. everyone struggles with this at some point and recently it has hit me hard. If they are are only hurting and not supporting it is time to move on.

Edit: cutting them out of your life may not be a complete cut off but putting space and time between interactions is just as good.
