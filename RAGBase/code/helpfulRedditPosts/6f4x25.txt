YSK: If you have Windows 10, it comes with a Linux Ubuntu Subsystem to natively run Linux applications

content:
I just pulled, built and ran a graphical Linux application on windows.

This is not just a shell, this is an entire subsystem. You can even install an xserver (GUI Windowing System) I recommend Xming X Server for Windows.

Open "Change or Remove a Program" and click on "Turn Windows features on or off" where you will find it listed.
