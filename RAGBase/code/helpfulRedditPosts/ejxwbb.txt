LPT: If your kids are having nightmares from watching a scary movie, show them the "behind the scenes" or "making of"

content:
I don't have kids or anything, but I remember in Middle School being freaked out by this movie about a girl that gets kidnapped at a mall, and when I watched a few videos about how it was made and behind the scenes footage, it completely broke the horrifying illusion for me. So I feel like this could be a useful tool.
