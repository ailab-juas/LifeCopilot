LPT: Your towel is a major influence on how you smell after a shower.

content:
If you haven't washed your towel in a while, it's going to have stale water and mildewy smell that's going to stick to you, and mask all that nice soap and shampoo smell. It's recommended you wash your towels after 3 - 5 uses. So having two towels and washing them every week is the sweet spot to ensuring you smell fresh and clean after a shower.
