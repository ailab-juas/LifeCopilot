LPT: If your neighbors aren't home and a courier leaves their package with you that needs to be signed for, sign your address, not your name. That way the person who owns that package can see the signature online and go to your house to collect it.

I recently ordered a package on line. I was expecting a call/email saying when they expected it to be delivered. I got an email to say my package had been delivered and signed for. True enough there was a signature in the email - but it wasn't mine or my housemates and I didn't recognize it. I spent ages online trying to find a contact number for the courier - no luck so had to drive out to there storage unit 2 days later after work. The gave me a number for a driver who told me he left it in another apartment 5 doors down.

The neighbors gave it to me when knocked on the door (but didn't explain why they hadn't dropped it over to me in the previous 48 hours). I was thinking after that if they had signed they're address as the signature, i would have seen it and been to get the package without any hassle.

EDIT: this is the signature they provided as proof that my parcel was delivered

EDIT 2: few people have pointed out that the signature looks like "100" when looked at upside. good catch but the complex I am in has number/letter cominations. the apartment number doesn't look anything like that.
