YSK an easy way to eliminate bad breath in a lot of cases

content:
The process takes minutes and usually lasts for a week per application. I’ve been doing it myself for years now. It has worked for a lot of people I know that have persisting bad breath.

You need two things:

**Hydrogen peroxide**, regular store concentration is best.

**Probiotic tablets**, I recommend going to Amazon and looking up tablets containing **BLIS M18**, which is a probiotic strain that actually **fights cavity causing bacteria itself.** Regular store probiotics will  remove odor however it makes more sense to populate your mouth with bacteria that actively assist your dental health. I use tablets with BLIS M18 to great effect.

Here’s the method:

1.	Floss/brush your teeth as normal.
2.	Use a mouthwash cap, cough syrup measuring cup, etc. Fill it halfway with hydrogen peroxide, other half with tap water.
3.	Swish and gargle the mixture.
4.	Rinse your mouth with tap water.
5.	Pop a probiotic tablet in your mouth and chew it up. Don’t swallow, just let it cover your whole mouth, your tongue, etc. We are trying to let the probiotic colonize.
6.	You can spit and rinse or just spit the rest out, up to you.
7.	

**EDIT: The first time you do this, you may want to wet your toothbrush with undiluted peroxide and try and brush your tongue as far back as you can. This will sanitize some usually untouched areas, allowing the probiotic to colonize.**

And that’s all.

Your breath after for the most part will be entirely odorless. Morning breath is almost eliminated. Even after a long day your breath stays odorless. The effects last about a week before you need to do the steps again.
