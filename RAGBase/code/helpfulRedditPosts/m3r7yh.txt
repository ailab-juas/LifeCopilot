YSK: That veterinarians have one of the highest suicide rates of any profession

content:
Why YSK:  If you are contemplating becoming a veterinarian, it is important for you to know what you are getting into.  There are unique stressors in our profession that make it very difficult emotionally.  

If you are a pet owner, you need to understand that veterinarians are there because they want to help your pet live a better life and snide comments about cost, emotional blackmail and threats are not ok, and can and do lead to idealistic professionals struggling with mental welfare and committing suicide at a shockingly high rate.   

Here is a video in support of mental health networks for veterinarians: [https://youtu.be/tpx68jmnr4w](https://youtu.be/tpx68jmnr4w)
