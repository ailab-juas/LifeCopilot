title:
LPT: When an elderly person can't hear you, speak deeper not louder.

content:
Learned this in med school and I use it everyday!

Edit: So far I've read all of your comments and the biggest thing I'm seeing is to enunciate and speak slower. The main reason I chose to not include this is because often people will over do.They will talk to the elderly or those with hearing problems and make them feel dumb , slow or mentally retarded. These tips will help you and your 95 year old grandma ha!
