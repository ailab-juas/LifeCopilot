LPT: did you buy a 6-pack of cans with the plastic tie holding them together? Do a bird, turtle, or fish a favor and snip the circular loops before throwing it out so they don’t get caught up in it.

Cans often come held together by plastic loops. [Turtles](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2617606/size/tmg-facebook_social.jpg) and [birds](http://myimages.bravenet.com/337/463/131/4/plasticstuckonbill.jpg) can get caught in them. It takes 2 seconds to snip the loops before throwing it out. Do it!

EDIT: Went to bed and woke up on the front page. Holy cow, thanks Reddit! 

EDIT EDIT: always recycle obviously. But also cut them as a precaution. Also they’re biodegradable but again it’s a precaution.
