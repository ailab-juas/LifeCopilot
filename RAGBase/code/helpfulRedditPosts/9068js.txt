title:
YSK that you can donate formal clothes like suits and dress shirts to your local Public Defenders' office for their incarcerated clients to wear in court.

content:
Inmates who can't afford to hire an attorney probably can't afford to buy a suit for court, so many Public Defenders' offices have a small selection of clothes for clients to wear whatever fits. If nothing fits, then the client's family will have to buy an outfit- or possibly more than one if a trial lasts more than a day. Public Defenders are underpaid and their offices are grossly underfunded. Consider donating your old suits, dress shirts, ties, belts, dress shoes, etc. to your local Public Defender.
