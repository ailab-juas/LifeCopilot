LPT: Before shaking a plastic ketchup or mustard bottle, open, squeeze out some air, close and then shake.

content:
After shaking just open and the bottle will suck in air, preventing goop from pouring out and making your cap messy.

Edit: To clarify, this is used to mix the condiment throughly. After ketchup or mustard have been sitting in the fridge (or outside) for some time, some watery goo lurks on the top of the condiment. Now this water is just nasty and needs to be mixed up, which is why you have to shake the bottle. Usually when this happens some pressure builds up and because of the shaking, some condiment will lie beneath the cap. If you open it up, some goo might shoot out, even hitting your face.

By squeezing out the air before shaking you don't have to worry about this as the bottle will always suck in air so nothing unpleasant shoots out.
