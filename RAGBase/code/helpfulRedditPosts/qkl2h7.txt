LPT: If you can't afford a medication or are uninsured, call the drug company and ask for a SmartCard or compassionate pricing. They'll ask 3 questions, which no verification, and then give you a policy number to give to your pharmacist that will usually cover 60-100% of the cost.

Needed a fill a new ADHD medication. I'm uninsured so the cost was going to be $160 for 30 pills. Called the drug company, they asked me three questions, and then gave me a policy for 100% coverage, or $0 medication. No verification needed for any of the answers. Good for 1 year. 

Drug companies have budgets to give away their medication to people who can't afford it or don't have insurance. If it's a highly competitive medication (like ADHD) they also have 30 pills for free to try it out (in hopes you'll ask your doctor to prescribe their medication). 

Don't let cost be the factor in getting the medication you need.
