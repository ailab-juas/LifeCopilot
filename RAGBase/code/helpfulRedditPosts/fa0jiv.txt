LPT: Keep a log of all of your work "wins" and accomplishments.

content:
Even if you don't think your position is long term, you will need these one day and it's not as easy to remember as you think. 

Something as simple as "I changed this process and customer wait time was cut in half." These will add up like you don't beleive. You might even start looking for things to do at work you can add them to the list. You might be 5 or ten years down the road and be asked these kind of things in a job interview. I have multiple times and wish I started my list sooner.
