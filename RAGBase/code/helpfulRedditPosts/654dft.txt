title:
LPT: if a friends stopped hanging out or coming to events and has mentioned money issues,, please don't pester them.

content:
It's likely they'd love to hang out and do fun stuff, but they're saying no or they can't afford it for a reason - continuing to bug them about something out of their control makes them feel worse. 

Edit: why do all my popular posts have typos in them?
