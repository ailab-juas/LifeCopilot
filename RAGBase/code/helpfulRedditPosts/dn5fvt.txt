LPT: if you're buying a car from a dealership, do NOT buy it on your first visit no-matter-what

content:
The car dealership business revolves around getting people to make quick, rash decisions while their being glared at by a sales rep and a finance manager. Do NOT make a decision to purchase on your first visit. Absolutely demand to go home and sleep on it. This also has the added benefit of putting pressure on the sales rep to come up with some other incentive to get you to come back, that you might have missed out on by just buying on the first visit.
