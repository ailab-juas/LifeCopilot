LPT: When using Google or Apple Maps, tapping the screen once with two fingers will zoom out.

content:
I've had trouble zooming out when I'm using my phone to navigate while driving.  With one hand on the wheel, and the phone in a cradle, a pinching motion to zoom out isn't as simple or controllable as I would like.

I've wanted something as simple as double tapping to zoom in, but to zoom out. Today I discovered that tapping once with two fingers does exactly that. 

So if anyone else has wanted or needed this like I have, well, there it is. 

Edit: Wow, I finally made the front page!  I'm going to savor this with a highball of Balvenie and tune out the voice in the back of my head that keeps repeating "All glory is fleeting".
