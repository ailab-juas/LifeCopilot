YSK that you can actually skip unskippable ads in YouTube.

content:
Not long ago YouTube implemented a double ad feature and it isn't uncommon for an unskippable ad to appear, frustrating users without an ad blocker.

In the lower left corner of the ad, next to the ad time remaining, there is an information symbol (an "i" inside a circle) which you can click on and select the option "Stop seeing this ad", where three options are given after. You can choose any of those options and it will stop playing the ad.

If you are fast enough you will always skip the ad in less than 5 seconds.
