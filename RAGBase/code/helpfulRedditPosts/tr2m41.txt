LPT: if you want to eat better, make it difficult to eat junk food

content:
For the first time in my life I'm living abroad, far from my family, so I need to be responsible and take care of myself. 

I am not good at all at controlling myself, in particular when it comes to eat junk food.

If I know there is a pack of chips in the kitchen, it is very difficult for me to not get it and finish it in one session, although I know I'll be feeling like shit afterwards. 

A simple solution that I found is to directly avoid buying junk food, so when I'm at home I don't even have the temptation to eat it around me.

It's way easier to esercitare self-discipline at the grocery shop, where you are going to be for a limited amount of time, than at home, where you pass a great amount of time. 

I hope this very simple tip could help you.
