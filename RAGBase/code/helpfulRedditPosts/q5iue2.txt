YSK: Amazon DOES know when you return a different item.

Why YSK: People think that a company the size of Amazon does not know what’s going on on individual orders because they’re big.

In reality, Amazon waits for the amounts to get bigger so they can turn the cases to the FBI and now it’s considered Wire-fraud. 

A man form the US made more than 200 returns for a total of 290K, now may be facing 20 years. While this is an extreme amount you should be smarter and just play straight.
