YSK: "Octopuses," "octopi," and "octopodes" are all acceptable pluralisations of "octopus." The only thing unacceptable is feeling the need to correct someone for using one of them.

Why YSK? When you correct people for using "octopuses," you not only look like a pedant, but the worst kind of pedant: a **wrong** pedant. 

While "octopi" is also acceptable as its plural form, "octopuses" needs no correction. Hell, even "octopodes" is fine and arguably more correct than "octopi," because of the word's Greek origin.

#*edit 2 for those arguing one of these is the right one and the other two are wrong: you're missing the entire point.*
