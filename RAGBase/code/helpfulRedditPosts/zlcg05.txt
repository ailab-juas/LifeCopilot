LPT: your passport effectively expires 6 months before the expiration date printed on it.

content:
Most countries enforce a 6-month rule on foreign passports.  To be be granted entry into such a country, your foreign passport must be valid for at least 6 months.  For example, if you are a US citizen and want to make a quick visit to China in July, then your passport cannot expire the following December. China will not allow you in.  You must renew it before you visit.

For this reason, treat your passport as if it expires six months before it says it does.  Renew it early.
