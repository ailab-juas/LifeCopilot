YSK: How and when to use "affect" vs. "effect".

content:
Nobody likes people who misuse to/two/too or there/their/they're.  Affect/effect is another tricky pair of words, and it's made worse because their meanings are similar.

Edit: Apparently having the top-left cell of a table empty leads to formatting errors on mobile.  Fixed.
