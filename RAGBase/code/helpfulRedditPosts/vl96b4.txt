LPT: If an aggressive person comes in to complain about something you have no control over, take out a piece of paper and write it down

content:
I work at an office and we have very angry people come in every now and then, I write down every noun and repeat it back to them every couple lines with “uh huh, okay” and they calm down because they feel like they’re being listened to and validated. It's something I started because this old guy came in and demanded I write what he was saying down and I just haven’t stopped since. As long as they see you’re writing they’re more inclined to be nicer to you because you’re making an effort to take care of their concern 


Of course, I throw the paper out after they leave because it isn’t my job

Edit: It appears no one is reading my responses in the comments and is writing very elaborate fanfiction about my work ethic and commitments to my job in the comments, I try my best to help out where I can, the papers that I throw out are a compilation of all their racist and or homophobic rambling 

Yes, I can make sure someone comes to check out your internet.

No I cannot deport your neighbors, but I can ask them to quiet down a bit. 
(Deportation part gets scrapped - I draft an email or make a phonecall about the noise)
