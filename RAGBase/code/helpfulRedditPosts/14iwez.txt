LPT: Wear your favorite clothes when you go shopping for more.

content:
If you wear your favorite clothes while you try other things on, you'll be able to judge if you really love new clothes before buying them. If you walk into the changing room wearing old ratty sweats that make you feel terrible, new clothes you try on will have to meet a lower standard. If you wear what you feel best in and can still impress yourself with your new clothes, they're probably worth buying.
