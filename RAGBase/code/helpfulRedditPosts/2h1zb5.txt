LPT: The correct &amp; easiest way to safely break up a dog fight .

content:
If you've ever taken your dog to a dog park, or have multiple dogs, you've probably seen two dogs get into a fight at some point.   Many dog owners immediately panic &amp;amp; react the wrong way...often leading to a very unsafe situation for both the dogs and the humans.  Typically, people's first reaction is panicking and yelling.  Everybody immediately tries to dive in to grab their scuffling dog's collars, putting their hands very close to the dogs' faces, trying to pull them out of harms way. Despite owners best intentions of looking out for their dog, this VERY dangerous - and i've often seen it result in owners getting bit or knocked to the ground.  It also makes breaking up the fight much harder than need be. 

**1st thing**  learn to recognize the difference between a real fight and play fight. Just because two dogs are making violent sounding noises &amp;amp; baring teeth while wrestling, this doesn't mean they aren't just playing. Mock fighting is perfectly normal and harmless dog behavior. Many owners freak out as soon as their dog starts rough housing...which can lead to poor socialization &amp;amp; a nervous pooch.

 How to know the difference? Watch your dog closely during play - if you see they're growling, baring teeth and nipping at each other, but not actually fully clamping down...they're usually just playing.  Also, during play, when one dog submits, the other dog should back off immediately.   Dogs can nip at each other without really hurting eachother. They will try to go for the neck...this is just instinctual dog behavior, and they aren't necessarily trying to hurt the other dog.  However, if one dog has attached himself to the other dog's neck and won't let go, this is no longer safe playing. If you start yelling at the dogs during play fight, this can actually egg them on to actually start going at it - so don't automatically freak out.   

**2.** This is the most important rule which everybody forgets. Don't panic. Chances are the fight looks &amp;amp; sounds a lot worst than it actually is.  In any case, jumping into a fight too soon can lead to you getting bit. Dogs will feed off your panic, and the fight will get worse.  Before doing anything, take a second to assess the situation &amp;amp; figure out the best approach. 

**3.** **DO:**Try making a loud noise to startle them into breaking up fight, this is often all it takes. Make sure its loud enough to surprise them.  A few very loud claps along with a stern BACK OFF should do the trick. Or  a loud "FIDO NO, BACK OFF". Sound confident, not afraid. Dogs can sense your fear &amp;amp; feed off of this. **Edit** As several people have mentioned, a loud whistle is a great tool to use in this situation. Dumping a water bottle/bowl or spraying a hose can also sometimes be a good first defense if you have them readily accessible. 
**DON'T**: Keep yelling if the loud noise doesn't work. Almost every owner makes the mistake of continually screaming. "FIDO NOOO NOOOO NOOOO FIDO NOOO". This not only doesn't help, it will actually make the fight worse since dogs are egged on by your yelling.  They feed off your screaming as a cue to increase their aggression. To them, your yelling is no difference than other dogs barking at them.   

**4.** **ALWAYS** approach the fighting dogs from the rear...stay as far away from their heads as you possibly can.  

  **DON'T:** Try to grab their collars. In the heat of a dog fight, they will both interpret this as you jumping into the scrum. This is a bad idea...once you pull your dogs head away, there is nothing stoping the other aggressive dog from latching onto you. Even your own dog will not recognize you while fighting, &amp;amp; can turn around and bite you.  I've seen dozens of people get bit trying to pull dogs apart by their collars.

**5.**  **DO** Grab your dog by his hind legs, near the thighs, and lift his legs into the air like hes a wheelbarrow. If you can, instruct the other dogs owner to do the same with their dog.  This puts you in complete control of your dog, while staying far away from their teeth. They will be unable to turn around to bite  you in this position, &amp; physically unable to lunge at the other dog without falling on their face. 

**6.** Still grabbing his hind legs, start quickly backing up in a zig zag motion. If they're latched on biting each other, this will force him to break off. With all of his weight balanced on his front paws, and you backing up, he really cannot do anything except focus on balancing. Without the use of his back legs, he will soon realize you are in complete control, and submit to your movements. 

**7** Keep backing your dog up until youre well away from the other dog, and the other owner has control over them.  Don't stop backing up until the other dog is completely under control by their owners. As soon as you can, yell "NO, BAD DOG",  roll your dog onto their back or side, and hold them down with your knee.  Your dog is now in submission and physically immobilized from re escalating. (**Edit**: Will add, only do this if you can do so safely based on your experience with your pet, otherwise just hold them tightly by the collar or immediately leash them. The idea here is to completely immobilize your dog from breaking free from your control &amp; going back after the other dog).  Keep them held down until their breathing slows and they are completely calm.  While they're on their back/side, talk to them in a soothing voice to diffuse the tension.  This may take several minutes...if you let your dog up before he's completely calm, he will likely run right back towards the other dog to attempt and attempt to continue the fight. 

**8.**As they calm down, rub their belly and tell them "Good boy". Reward &amp;amp; praise them for being calm. 

**9.** After you release your dog, keep a close eye on them. At this point you should keep them completely separated from the dog they were just fighting with. Either you or the other owner should leave the park. If you don't there is a very good chance they will get back into it. Its a good idea just to leash your dog at this point and remove them from the area. 


Last, ALWAYS watch your dog closely during play so you can de-escalate a situation before it turns into a full blown fight. If you see tension building during a play sesion, teach your dog the "BACK OFF" command.  Loudly and forcefully tell your dog to BACK OFF along with a clap.  Keep him separated from the other dog, and roll him on his back to submit. Then praise him once he's on the ground. Make sure to tell the other dog owner to grab their dog as well. 

Follow these rules and you will find breaking up a dog fight is much safer and MUCH easier. 

**EDIT:** One of the first pieces of advice I gave is to access the situation.  While this method has worked in probably 90% of the tussles I've seen, it doesn't make sense in every case. There are a lot of considerations such as the size of the dogs, which dog is controlling the fight, how many dogs are involved.  If you have a tiny Chihuahua being attacked &amp;amp; pinned down by a 100lb rotty...this is not what I would call a "fight"...this is an attack, and you should treat it as such.   Tools such as whistles &amp;amp; water bottles can be great to help break up dogs going at it...assuming you have them readily available..which often is not the case.   Break sticks are also good to have on hand, but should only be used if one dog has another dog pinned down or locked up in his mouth. Using a break stick requires getting your hands dangerously close to the dog's mouth, and should only be used as a last resort if all other options have failed.   Always remember, while we love our animals like family,  your life &amp;amp; safety is more important than any dog's.

**Edit 2** 1) Some people are responding with the assumption that only aggressive dogs get into fights. Anybody who has been around multiple dogs knows this just isn't true. Dogs are still animals...if they get aggravated, or instigated, they will defend themselves or lash out regardless of how well behaved they are normally.  
                2) The "roll him on his back/side" at the end seems to be a point of contention here. I will admit that the effectiveness of this maneuver is still highly debated in dog training.  However, I suggest it here not as a training tool, or means to establish your dominance, but rather as a practical method to gain complete control over your dog &amp; immobilize until they're calm enough to let loose. Often after a fight, with both dogs still aggrevated, i've seen one or both break free from their owner's hold of their collar or snap at other dogs. With your dog pinned down, one knee on their head, and your body weight holding down their body...they are physically unable to re-escalate the situation or snap at you.  You have a far greater chance of them breaking loose or turning around &amp; snapping at you if you're just pulling them by the collar. With practice you can do this safely without hurting the dog or exposing yourself to a bite. My experience with the dogs i've worked with is this works very well. The praising, and speaking in a calm voice is rewarding their calmness and submission, which is also beneficial. If you choose not to force your dog to submit, just make sure you have a damn good hold of them until they chill out.  
               3) This video is a good example of exactly what not to do in a dog fight..but is an all too common sight at the park: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKqyMQ4LqTw
      As you can see, the guy was knocked down, causing him to get bit on the leg. He then tried to pull them apart while still on the ground, and you can see around the 10 second mark how the one dog turns around &amp;amp; snaps at him.
