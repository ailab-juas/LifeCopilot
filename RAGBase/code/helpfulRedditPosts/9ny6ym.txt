title:
YSK: plunging sinks and tubs often does nothing because the air forced down is redirected right back out the overflow drain unless you seal off those holes first with duct tape.

content:
Sinks and tubs have overflow prevention drains hidden near the top of the basin and a slot under the bath stopper toggle switch, respectively. Any force applied to the drain with a plunger just comes out these holes. If you seal them up with duct tape first, you can plunge sinks and tubs as effectively as toilets and avoid wasting money on chemicals and plumbers.
