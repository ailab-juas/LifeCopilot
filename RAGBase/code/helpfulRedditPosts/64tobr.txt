LPT: Learning a new language? Practice with children's books like you did when you learned your first language!

content:
I've found that reading children's books helped immensely to form sentences I could use in a (simple) conversation. 

EDIT: A lot of comments saying this is a bad idea and to stick to the text books. I meant this should be used as practice while learning a language. Having lists of words, conjugations and grammar rules did absolutely nothing for me when I was trying to learn Spanish. With children's books, you are presented with a lot of pictures that relate to the story, and I found it was easier for me to make the connections this way.
