YSK SiriusXM is likely selling your info to those extended car warranty spammers

**Why YSK:** SiriusXM is *likely* selling their customer data to those extended car warranty call lists. Here's how I know this.

Many years ago I purchased a used OEM radio that was originally installed in a 2008 Chrysler Aspen that had SiriusXM compatibility. The radio was compatible with my car though, like many Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep cars of the time, which was *not* a Chrysler Aspen. This was a cash sale, so the person who sold it to me knew nothing about me.

Since my last radio did not have satellite radio, I wanted to give it a try, so I subscribed. When you call or go online and enter the radio ID, it will confirm with you the year, make, and model that they have in their database for that radio ID. It matched what the seller said it came out of. Subscribed, activated, and everything worked fine.

To this day, I continue to get calls about purchasing an extended warranty for my, you guessed it, 2008 Chrysler Aspen.

How could that be? I never actually owned one, nor have I owned anything even remotely close to that. The only person or company that ever knew I had any connection to one was SiriusXM. So that's how I know they sold/shared my data.

**Edit:** I would like to clarify, I am not saying they are the only ones. I get a lot of these calls. Some will specify a make and model of what they think I own, and some do not. Itâ€™s very clear that the ones that do sourced their data from SiriusXM, as they are the only ones that could link me to a 2008 Chrysler Aspen in any way.

**Edit 2:** I would also like to point out I have been getting these calls for *years*, even before these abundant spam calls that everybody (including myself) gets. These are real people calling who would answer or leave a voicemail and say something like, "Hi, this is John calling from the vehicle services department regarding your 2008 Chrysler Aspen's warranty."
