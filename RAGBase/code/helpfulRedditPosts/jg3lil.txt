LPT: if you eat out frequently because you "can't cook", spend a few hundred dollars on cooking classes and nice knives. A little knowledge and good tools will return all that money back to you in less than a year. Bonus: cooking has been regularly shown to have great mental health benefits.

The most common excuses I hear from people who eat out multiple times a week are that they either "can't cook," or they can, but they just hate doing it - and usually the frustration from doing it stems from having really poor quality food prep tools.  With a little know-how and a set of knives that will easily slice through things, cooking becomes both easy and enjoyable.  And it will save you a *ton* of money compared to delivery / takeout. It might sound like a pricey investment at first, but it will come back to you so quickly when you start cooking for yourself.  And you'll feel so accomplished when you're sitting down to eat something you made yourself.
