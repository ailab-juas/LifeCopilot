LPT: If you work in retail and want to call out someone making a mess in your store/department kindly ask them "Am I okay to put this back/away?" most of the time they'll say they're done with it and make an effort to not make any more mess.

If you follow up with a "That's okay! I've just got a habit of tidying up things people are still using and now I always make sure to ask." it usually prevents them from getting insulted.

Of course doesn't work for all customers, but I can say that I only find myself putting away a few things most of the time than having a one person tornado.
