title:
LPT: If during an interview you discuss your pay, benefits, or your responsibilities and the employer avoids the topic, shuts you down, or chooses not to hire you, you dodged a bullet. Thatâ€™s an employer who is not interested in you or your well being, but would treat you like you are expendable.
