YSK that if you like to read, your local library might have an app where you can download ebooks and audiobooks for free.

Why YSK: It's free! As someone who has paid for services like Audible or has had yearly memberships to Barnes and Noble, I feel like such an idiot for just now discovering this tool.

Many public libraries have an app, or use a third party service like Hoopla or Libby by Overdrive, where you can download tons of ebooks and audiobooks just by using your library card. 

There may still be a wait list on certain books, but it's definitely worth using, especially since you already pay the taxes to use them.

Happy reading!
