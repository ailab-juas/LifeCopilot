YSK: Lawyers are hired guns. If they accept a case, then they have a moral and legal obligation to defend their client to the best of their ability

Why YSK: People often unfairly blame lawyers for their courtroom antics and for the actions of the client.  Sure, it is fair to argue that maybe a lawyer should not have accepted the case to begin with. But also, private law firms are often "assigned" to defend horrible cases. 

There are many lawyers that go home and take a cold shower because they had to defend a rapist or a mass murderer. 

But in the USA, one of our legal principles is that EVERYONE has the right to a competent attorney. And we should be proud of this fact.  Because if the law protects rapists and mass murderers then it will protect you and me too.

You should not blame a lawyer for doing their job.  They can literally lose their license, career, and go to jail if they don't do their job.
