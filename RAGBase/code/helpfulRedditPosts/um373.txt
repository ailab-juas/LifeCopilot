LPT: All the Windows 7 tools you'll ever need, in one place. Great for those who are always called upon to "fix my computer for me."

content:
EDIT: WARNING!!! THIS IS WINDOWS 7 ONLY -- DO NOT use it for Vista or XP.

Some machines seem to have a problem if you create this on the desktop, so you should probably put it somewhere else that is handy, such as a folder or a USB drive.

You can put this folder on a USB drive so you have it wherever you go. It puts every tool that Windows 7 has in one place, so you can just change settings and fix stuff with ease. And it takes up basically no space.

1) Create a new empty folder wherever you want (probably not on the desktop...see caution above)(e.g. nested inside another folder or on a USB drive)

2) Name the folder whatever you want, but ADD a dot (period) and THIS sequence as the last part of the folder name:

{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}

That's it. Open that "folder" and you'll find everything you need right there.  I call my folder: "Windows 7 Tools.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}"
