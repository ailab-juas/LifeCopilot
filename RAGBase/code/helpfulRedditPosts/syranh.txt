title:
LPT: A Mind Trick to Cope with "Difficult" People

content:
If someone is being really abrasive but non-violent - shouting in my face, rude, or just illogical - I pretend (temporarily, to myself, in my head) that they have an actual mental disability.

As in "this person has a condition they cannot help, and/or they do not know better than to behave the way they are now."

- Maybe it's true.

- Maybe they were bullied or beaten as a child.

- Perhaps they recently lost a loved one.

Who knows? But what I do know is I can't get mad at a person with a limp who slows me down, or someone who experiences epilepsy if an episode somehow inconveniences me, or a person with a support dog that keeps them safe.

We're all people with different strengths and obstacles to overcome. Sometimes those obstacles get the best of us. How is this situation any different?

So in the moment, I just assume that this behavior is beyond their control, and my attitude almost always changes from defensive to supportive.

It's entertaining how often I've used this to keep composed, and during the process realized that their behavior was justified and less illogical than I first thought.


Disclaimer: Nothing here is a personal absolute. Just a mind trick I play on myself to de-escalate situations and keep myself composed, when that is the active priorty. All well-intentioned.
