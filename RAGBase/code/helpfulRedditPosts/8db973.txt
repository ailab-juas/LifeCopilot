LPT: When it is unclear whether you should use"who" or "whom" in a question, pay attention to the potential answer. If "he" sounds right in the answer then "who" is usually correct. If "him" sounds right in the answer then "whom" is usually correct.

Examples: 
"Whom is our leader?"  --&gt;  "Him is our leader"  :/
"Who is our leader?"  --&gt;  "He is our leader"   :)
"Who should we follow?"  --&gt;  "We should follow he"  :/
"Whom should we follow?"  --&gt;  "We should follow him"  :)

Edit: also works with who/they and whom/them. "Who is next? They are next." "Whom do we admire? Hmm, definitely not them"
