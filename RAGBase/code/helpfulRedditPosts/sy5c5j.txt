LPT: grab a bag of rice and a bag of beans every time you go to the store. They are cheap and last a long time. You never know when things will go south for you or your country.

edit: so many of the comments don’t seem to understand my point so let me see if I can lay it out a bit better. 

Try to grab some extra shelf stable food when you are at the store if you can. Rice and beans are a good option for that. Set yourself a reasonable goal and shoot for it. My goal is 6 months. Once you’re at your goal just try to maintain that amount of food and make sure to cycle through the food because you don’t want it to go to waste. Try to stock things you normally eat. 

I really hope no one is ever in that tough of a situation but it happens from time to time. There are a lot of great recommendations in the comments about more basics you might want to consider depending on where you live and your situation. 

Thanks for the upvotes and awards!
