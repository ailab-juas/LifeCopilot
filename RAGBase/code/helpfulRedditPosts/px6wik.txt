LPT: recording video at a concert? Don't sing along. Yes, the speakers are louder than you are in general - but you're a lot closer to the microphone.

content:
I see so many videos from concerts that are completely ruined by the fact that the person recording it is singing off-key and out of time with the actual artist, and it's even louder than the person they're filming.  I don't know if this is because people think "there's no way the recording will pick it up, the speakers are louder than I am" or if they just don't know better.  But if you want to preserve memories of a show that you love, do yourself a favor and be quiet while you're recording.  I assume you want to remember the artist you paid to go see, and not your own out of tune vocals.  You and your friends will enjoy the ensuing videos much more this way.
