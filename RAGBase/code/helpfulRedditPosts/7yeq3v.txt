LPT: Instead of using the phrase "I assumed..." use the phrase "My understanding was..."

content:
The phrase "I assumed..." has a very negative connotation, and people will view it as you jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.




On the other hand, if you use the phrase "My understanding was...", it has a way more positive connotation. Plus people will just view it as you made a slight mistake in understanding, and will be far kinder to you.



This is best applied in a workplace/professional environment. If you tell your boss that you "assumed" something typically results in a reprimand; saying "My understanding was..." will instead just be viewed as a miscommunication.
