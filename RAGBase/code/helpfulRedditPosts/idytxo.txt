LPT: Buy a wool blanket to keep in your vehicle

content:
Speaking from personal experience. I've found uses for even the most basic wool blanket. It doesn't take up much room, is durable, and inexpensive. Mine was $20 for a 8x6 ft. sized blanket.

Going on a picnic? Throw this bad boy on the ground to sit on.

Moving furniture? Lay it down to protect from scratches.

Last winter I was camping with friends, I brought a light sleeping bag which was a big mistake. I got out my wool blanket and wrapped myself up and actually stayed warm in the freezing temperature.

This thing can be a life saver and it's no big deal if you ruin it.

Edit: A lot of people are mentioning protection from bushfires as well. I personally don't have to deal with that, but it's one hell of an idea!
