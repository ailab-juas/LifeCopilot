LPT: College Students - Do not "pick a major." Instead, pick a career and then find the correct major that goes with it.

content:
This seems simple, but I teach at a college, and thinking along the lines of "Career" instead of "Major" makes a huge difference in how well my students do academically and professionally.  
 
Edit: I am NOT saying you need to pick your career at 17/18. Rather, I am saying that when you get to college you need to decide what your career will be BEFORE you choose your major.  Decide what you want to do, then pick the major that fits it.
 
And, since people are commenting on it, I will say yes, you need to take a bunch of different classes but it is a really good idea to have your career locked down by the end of your sophomore year, and preferably sooner.
