LPT: If you're nearsighted, alone, &amp; can't find your glasses pull up the camera on your phone &amp; use it as your eyes to spot them

content:
I'm practically blind without my glasses, I have spares at home, work, &amp; in the car cuz I would be functionally useless without them. A branch took my glasses while mowing &amp; I was able to spot them in the grass using the camera on my phone, holding it up to my face. It's not perfect, but it may help you out of a pinch.
