YSK people who gossip about everyone they know are probably doing it to you, too

content:
This is something that isn't limited to a single gender or age group; people across the world do it. 

If you notice that every time you speak one-on-one with a person, they have negative or salacious things to say about your mutual friends (or even people you've never met!), that person has a personality or behavioral problem that affects ALL of their friendships and relationships - you are not exempt.

Sometimes it may be simply for the attention they receive for bringing "the tea"; other times it may be indicative of a more sinister issue, undiagnosed mental illness, or a malignant personality disorder (such as Narcissism).


**WHY YSK** : Because you should distance yourself from untrustworthy people, and this is a red flag that often goes overlooked. It's a tough pill to swallow that someone who you might consider to be a good friend could be capable of betraying you in this way, but it is important to realize, so you can make informed choices about who you want to allow in your life.
