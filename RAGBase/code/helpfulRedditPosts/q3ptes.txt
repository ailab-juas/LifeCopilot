YSK: There's a website that allows you to move playlists from one platform to another--or convert those playlists to txt or csv

Why YSK: I can't be the only person who has been trying to find an easy way to convert Spotify playlists to text. This site (which I am not affiliated with in any way) also allows you to convert or move a playlist from one platform (like Google Play Music, iTunes, Tidal, SoundCloud, even YouTube) to any other platform. You can transfer up to 1,000 songs for free, but the premium plans are really cheap. $2/mo for unlimited transfers, and you only have to buy one month at a time.
