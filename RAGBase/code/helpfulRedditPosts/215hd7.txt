LPT: The REAL way to look better in photographs. I went from being unphotogenic to taking nice pics with this.

This video was the secret.  It shows you before and after differences.  It is very much a how to on the subject of appearing well in photographs.  The short of it is: move your entire head towards the camera, and drop your chin slightly.  This creates more definition along the chin and neck area.  But even with that said - watch the video.

edit - I wish I could claim credit for finding this video... but I could swear that this has been posted here before.  I just don't know who posted it so that I can give appropriate credit.

edit2 - Hurley814 has been identified as NOT the source of the video.

edit3 - the same guy did another video on squinching.  APColleen suggested it in a post below.  It's pretty good so if this subject interests you, then you might want to check this video out as well.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff7nltdBCHs
