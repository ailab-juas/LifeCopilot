LPT: When you put in a fresh bin bag, sprinkle some cat litter into the bottom of the bag. It will absorb any gross liquids, and your bags will have almost no bad odour.

content:
1. Bin bag = trash bag/rubbish bag/garbage bag.
2. You don't HAVE to use cat litter. You can use shredded paper, baking soda, dryer sheets, whatever.
3. In my country we only have trash collection one day a week, so I can't change my bags every day.
4. Unscented cat litter is a thing.
5. The litter goes in the BAG guys
