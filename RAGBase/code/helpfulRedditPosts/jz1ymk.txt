LPT: When you're stuck in making a decision, pretend your friend is going through the same thing and ask yourself what advice you would give your friend, sometimes our own feelings tend to block the logical/right choice

Hey guys! This tip has helped me out a lot. Ok so, when you're stuck in making a decision or don't know what to do, pretend your friend is the one in the situation and ask yourself, what advice would you give them? Let me explain, one of the reasons people have trouble making decisions, is because their feelings will block the logical or right thing to do. Don't get me wrong, sometimes feelings can help your decision, but sometimes they can also get in the way. 

Here's an example: let's say you're in a troubling relationship with a significant other, it's toxic but you don't want to leave because you believe your S/O will change or things will get better. Now imagine if your friend was in the exact same situation, knowing what you know, while blocking your feelings off, what would you advise your friend? Would you also tell them to stay because your friend loves their S/O? Or would you tell them to leave the toxic relationship because your feelings aren't blocking the logical and right thing you should do(every situation is different, but that's why you analyze it from the inside and outside POV). Hope this helps and makes sense!

Also, I suggest typing out life rules/lessons you learn along the way of life, so that way you have something to look back on or update as you go. Plus, you can share it with friends and family in case they have something to add or you just want to advise them. I have one of my own, it's useful :)
