LPT: Hate the feeling of putting eyedrops in your eyes? Run the bottle under hot water for a few seconds to warm the solution and you'll barley feel the drops.

content:
I do this every time, and it makes the eye drops feel more like actual tears than anything.  Room temperature drops "sting" my eyes going in. Putting drops in after warming the solution  is honestly barley noticeable.

**EDIT**: After reading through the comments, I'd like to point out what others have said that are of value.
This post was meant for OTC eye drops for redness/allergies/irritation and such. If your prescription drops need to be refrigerated, of course don't do this.

Also, as /u/MouthyMike pointed out below "you don't actually have to have your eye open.. just drop it in the corner of your closed eye and open your eye then... makes it much easier.."

I do that, and I actually STILL need the drop to be warm. For me, cool drops are like icepicks in my eyes.


**EDIT 2**: If you want to know if the solution is at a good temperature, do a test drop on the *top* side of your hand or forearm. It should feel only wet with no temperature sensation either way.

Cheers and thanks everyone.
