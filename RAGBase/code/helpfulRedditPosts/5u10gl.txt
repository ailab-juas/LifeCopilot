LPT: If you have a friend or family member that provides a professional service (legal, medical, accounting, etc), always offer to pay for their service. Don't assume that they will help you for free.

My in-laws are accountants and we were talking about taxes this past weekend. Since I just started a business, I asked if I could hire them to prepare my taxes. The response I received was very eye opening; my mother-in-law said, "I'll take care of it and give you the family discount, but I want to thank you for offering to pay...most of the family EXPECT us to do their taxes for free."

EDIT: Obligatory "I can't believe I made the front page of Reddit!" - I'll be sure to tell my mother-in-law (to which I'm sure she'll reply, "huh?" 

Sorry if I didn't include your profession, but I love hearing all the responses. On a personal note, my father was in the trades and would always help out friends/family/neighbors with simple repairs. However, in return, he would always ask if they could donate their time to [Habitat For Humanity](http://www.habitat.org/) for a local build. Don't want to get to preachy, but [HFH](http://www.habitat.org/) is a really great organization and if you ever get a chance to volunteer on a build, I highly recommend it.

EDIT2: Great replies, keep 'em coming! Apparently, IT professionals are in demand and tired of hearing, "I have one small favor to ask you..." from friends/family.

For those who think expecting to get paid is greedy, I would advise to at least offer some food, gas or you could trade services. My father once helped a welder remodel his bathroom and in exchange he received a new wood stove for the sauna.
