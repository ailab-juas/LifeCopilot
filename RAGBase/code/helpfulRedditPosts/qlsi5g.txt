LPT: How to professionally take a sick day

content:
Boss,

I'm not feeling well this morning. 

[I'll be in late / I won't be able to come in]

[I hope to be in tomorrow. / I'll let you know my status for tomorrow this evening / I'll probably be out tomorrow as well]

(Bonus line for 2021!) [I'm pretty sure it's not COVID / I plan on getting a COVID test]

[I'll be working remotely for my usual hours / I'll check email as I can today / I'll touch base tomorrow morning]

Thank you,
