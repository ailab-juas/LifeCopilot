YSK: You can still cum and ejaculate even if you've had a vasectomy.

Why YSK: A common reason why men are reluctant to get a vasectomy is that they falsely think that they won't cum or ejaculate after the procedure. You can still cum but this will have no sperm in it. You have to wear a condom for the first two weeks though as some sperm may be present. Posting this to celebrate November as Men's Health Awareness Month.
