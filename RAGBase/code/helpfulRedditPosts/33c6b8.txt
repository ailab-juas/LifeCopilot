LPT: Create "snapshots" in your life every now and then.

content:
If you are for example talking a walk or spend times with your loved ones or drive home from work or any other time in your life you can create (what i call) snapshots. I am NOT talking about taking your camera or phone out of your pocket and taking a picture. I am talking about mentally creating a memory which you like to remember.

You begin by focusing your mind and all your senses (sight, smell, temperature etc.) on the sensations which happen at this exact time. Dont think about anything else and just breathe in the moment and try to remember this exact moment as best as possible. Do this when you notice that the moment you are living in right now is a happy and nice moment and you want to remember this moment exactly as it is and connect it to a good feeling.

If you do this correctly (which isn't a hard thing to do) you then have a pretty pretty good memory of all the things you felt in this moment the place itself and the time it happened.

You can use this imaginary "snapshot" to think about when in bad times or just if you like to when you just don't feel so well. You will notice that this is a pretty good way to just save moments in your life and you will learn to live more in the now and in the moment instead of being in the future or past with your mind or "clouded" by your own thoughts.

I really hope i explained this as best as possible.. this method really improved my life and i am a lot more happy with it!
And always remember: Mind before matter! There is always a reason to be happy.
