LPT: A good way to start loving yourself and gain confidence is to keep the promises you make to yourself.

content:
If you don’t keep your own promises, you won’t trust yourself or believe in yourself. If you keep your own promises you will prove yourself reliable and trustworthy, which is important for self respect and confidence.

”Small” everyday promises are equally as important as ”big” promises too. If you say you’re gonna do something everyday but always end up procrastinating, that will affect you long term in a lot more ways than one because you break your own promise.


Edit: WOW this blew up! Didn’t realise so many people were in the same boat. I’m glad I could help with this post it means a lot to me, I’ve struggled with this a lot myself. (Learned all this the hard way).

As many mentioned, being kind on yourself when failing is important, but I also think a lot of people are too kind, they don’t take their promises seriously enough, so breaking them means nothing. This goes deeper than it seems. 

BUT, don’t hate on yourself when failing either, just feel that bit of dissapointment and shame, say ”that’s not like me” and use that as motivation to keep your next promise.
Also be careful what you promise yourself, you may just let yourself down. You wouldn’t promise anyone else something you can’t hold, so don’t do it to yourself. Maybe try promising ”trying your best at X” instead when it comes to certain things, like getting a specific job.
