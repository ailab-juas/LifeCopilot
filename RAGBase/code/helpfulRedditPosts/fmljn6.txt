YSK that Aquariums may be shut down, but their livestreams are not!

content:
Monterey Bay Aquarium sent out an email recently that reminded me of their exhibit cams! If you're stuck inside and anxious, you can watch jelly fish, the kelp forest, turtles, otters, and more!  If you love this service and have a little to spare, consider making a donation to your local aquarium or (ethical) zoo! Have fun and stay inside, yall &lt;3
