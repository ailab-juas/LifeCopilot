LPT: If you start working out on your own, or in a low price gym without much personalized training, consider this: the first thing a good personal trainer does, is checking your posture and fixing muscle imbalances if necessary.

This means, if you do not have a personal trainer, you must take this step yourself. Fixing posture comes first, then you can think about bulking or losing weight. Of course you can do both, I'm talking about priority, not timelines.

If you sit 8 hours a day, it's almost certain that you'll have some of them.
That is a *good* thing, because tackling them will mean rapid progress.

Examples to check for are pelvic tilt and round back. Often these are muscle imbalances and you should train in a way that fixes them. If you do this, you can sort of become taller and appear more lean, because your back is straight and your belly pulled in.

Edit: one more thing, I'm not trying to talk you into hiring a personal trainer. A good one is always beneficial I guess, but do you need a personal trainer to figure out whether you have a round back and include  one or two exercises in your workout to address the issue? Not really. And that is all you need to make a difference already.
