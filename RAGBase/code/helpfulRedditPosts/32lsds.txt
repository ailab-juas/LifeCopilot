title:
YSK that you can totally customize Netflix

content:
With the chrome extension Flix Plus, you can customize your Netflix to do things like: 

* Hide the descriptions of episodes of television shows to avoid seeing spoilers by accident


* Show reviews from Rotten Tomatoes instead of having to decipher the sometimes-misleading Netflix star system

* Hide movies and shows you've already seen and/or rated so that everything you're searching through is new content

* And more! ... check out [this LifeHacker article](http://lifehacker.com/flix-plus-customizes-netflix-to-your-hearts-desire-1640968001) about it. 

I promise I don't work for LifeHacker or chrome, but this has totally changed the way I use Netflix!
