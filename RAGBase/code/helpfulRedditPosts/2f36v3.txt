LPT: As opposed to what the other LPT says, don't offer beer to people working on/in your house. Instead, it's far healthier and far less risky to offer coffee, tea, lemonade, or gatorade throughout the day. Also, homemade treats or candy bars work wonders for motivation :)

[The other LPT](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2f2ii8/lpt_if_you_have_trades_working_on_your_house/) suggests giving beers to your tradesmen at the end of Friday.  This is very risky for many reasons, and something that you should NOT do!  Want to motivate craftsmen through food/drink?  That's awesome!  There's many alternatives to alcohol.

* Edit: a LOT of people on here clearly aren't understand the risk associated with giving tradesmen alcohol.  To keep it easy, I've listed some of the risks involved:
1. The underage issue: It's illegal to give anyone underage alcohol, and without carding every person, it can oftentimes be impossible to gauge the age of all the workmen.
2. Liability: If you give someone alcohol *while* they're working, and then they mess up or hurt themselves or someone else, you could easily be held liable.  If you give someone alcohol *after* work and then they have an accident while driving under the influence, you could also easily be held liable.
3. You could get the person fired: Many (most?) companies have a strict no alcohol/drug policy while at work.  If a boss finds out that your tradesman was drinking while at your house, they could easily be fired.
4. You have no idea how that specific individual will react after drinking: Unless you know this workman very, very closely (in which case, have at it), you have NO idea how this person will react after having a brew or two.  Everyone has a different tolerance, and everyone has aspects of their personality that become more prevalent upon consumption of alcohol.  What happens if they start demanding more, or if they start rampaging?
5. It's just not professional:  I agree that free beer is great.  I agree that most people would LOVE for their employer to give them free beer.  Often.  During their shift.  After their shift.  All the time.  Of course, there is a reason that most employers in the world don't give their employees alcohol, and why drinking alcohol in the workplace isn't generally tolerated.  Why should it should be any different, just because the job in question is in a person's house?  If anything, tradespeople should be held to an even higher standard, as they're working on people's private property.

To all the workmen who are currently calling me a **cunt**, or a **bitch**, or "mom" for me suggesting that they **shouldn't be drinking alcohol while on a job** (and as long as you're at the employer's house, you're on the job), I've put together some really important information for you:
Alcoholics Anonymous: http://www.aa.org/
Information about Alcohol Liability Laws: http://socialhostliability.org/law/
How to quit drinking: http://www.wikihow.com/Quit-Drinking-Alcohol

And let me just reiterate, because **a lot of you aren't getting this**: there isn't anything wrong with drinking beer.  At your house.  Or with your friends.  After work.  I love beer!  But it would be nothing short of irresponsible and unprofessional for me to drink while at my place of work.

Also, special shoutout to /u/yeahujelly, for a pm reading: "u a bitch. stfu u cunt, I aint doing shit for a hatoraid and a fucking cookie...shove it up your moist ass twat"

Thanks for the gold, whoever you are!!
