If you use a multi-computer setup try Garage Mouse without Borders to use your mouse and keyboard across your computers.

If you used a multi computer setup for a while you may have found [Synergy](http://synergy-foss.org/). Synergy allows you to use your main desktop mouse and keyboard on other computers. 

After using Synergy for a few days I was annoyed to choose which input to be used. After some search I found [Garage Mouse without Borders](http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=35460). In fact it allows you to use the input of any connected device.

Give it a try, its free and safe to use, the setup is quite easy.

**Edit**: It's **Windows only**. Forgot to mention it, because I'm just using it on my Windows machines.
If you work across Windows and Mac you can try [ShareMouse](http://www.keyboard-and-mouse-sharing.com/), but I hit into a bug when using multiple monitors on one machine. ShareMouse has similar features as Garage Mouse.

**Edit2**: Thanks to /u/duclicsic , he recommends [x2x](https://github.com/dottedmag/x2x/) for **Linux**.

tl;dr:

* **Windows** machines give *[Garage Mouse without Borders](http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=35460)*  a try

* **Windows and Mac** try *[ShareMouse](http://www.keyboard-and-mouse-sharing.com/)*

* **Windows, Mac and Linux** try *[Synergy](http://synergy-foss.org/)*, which requires one computer to act as host (Only host can control mouse/kb across multiple devices).

* **Linux** try *[x2x](https://github.com/dottedmag/x2x/)*
