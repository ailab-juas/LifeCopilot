LPT: Don't let all these "Dad swore he'd never have a pet, but look at him now!" posts fool you. Most people who don't want a pet 1) mean it 2) wouldn't be good owners 3) both of the above

content:
It might be tempting to think that you can surprise someone with a pet and they'll "come around", but this is a risky move for all parties. Pets are an enormous financial, time, and emotional obligation and these posts that celebrate the times it turned out well are exceptions.
