The scandal with Wells Fargo continues to grow, with [more fake accounts being discovered, including credit cards and bill pay services.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/31/investing/wells-fargo-fake-accounts/index.html) (In addition, they're accused of ripping off auto insurance customers and small business owners.)

When I worked there in 2008, I was trained to convince every customer that they should open more accounts. The managers even pressured me into bringing friends and family members in to open accounts. It's clear in retrospect that the "rock star" bankers were getting their big numbers in questionable ways. I'm sorry I played along. Now I just want to make sure that everyone who was affected by this terrible sales culture receives justice.
