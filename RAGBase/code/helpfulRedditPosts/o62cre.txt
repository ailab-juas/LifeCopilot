YSK: your body is still changing in your 20s

content:
Why YSK: This is something I had never learned until the past year. None of my friends had heard of this either. I noticed my body composition and where fat went was changing. I previously struggled with an eating disorder for several years, so this was hard for me to accept. Your body is still maturing and changing as you age, not just in your 20s but throughout your life. It's normal and healthy. You may try to get back to a weight or shape you were when you were a teenager and it may be impossible/unhealthy because your hormones have shifted. I wish I had known this sooner myself so I figured I would make a post about it to let other people know that gaining some weight or your body changing shape still in your 20s is a normal part of life.
