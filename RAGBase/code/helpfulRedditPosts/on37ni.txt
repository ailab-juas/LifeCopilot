title:
LPT: If youâ€™re potty training your child, put TWO sets of mattress pads and sheets on their bed, in alternating order: mattress pad, sheet, mattress pad, sheet. If they have an accident in the middle of the night, just pull off the top set and the bed is already ready to go again without a hassle.
