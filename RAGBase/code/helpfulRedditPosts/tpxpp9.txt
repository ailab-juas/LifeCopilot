title:
LPT. Start the meeting on time.

content:
Don't "hold off for a couple of minutes " to wait for those who aren't there. Whether it's a meeting, class, or whatever, those who showed up on time are the ones who deserve your courtesy.

Edit: Didn't expect that so many would find this advice  controversial. Just looked last night after a busy work day. It's because we're all busy that I stick by this guideline. It's not about shaming latecomers or doing anything obnoxious like locking the door. We all have good reasons why we might be late sometimes. But if I am late, it is only right that I am the one who is inconvenienced. Obviously, if it's your client or boss, all bets are off: we meet them on their terms. For those who speculated, I am a professor and consultant, and evidently an all-round uptight jerk. I meet with students, other faculty, administrators, non-profit organizations and their clients, lawyers, etc. My advice is based on decades of meetings. (Cue "okay boomer" or substitute another dismissal of your choice!) Thanks to all who shared your views.
