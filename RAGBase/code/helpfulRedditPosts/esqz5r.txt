LPT: You don't need an opinion on everything and you certainly don't have tp make one during a conversation.

content:
Recently I've discovered that I have opinions on matters that don't affect me or I didn't care about prior to  someone made me make one during either a conversation or thru Social Media. 

If you're in a conversation about a matter you know nothing about, understand or care about, it's fine to tell the other person you do not have any opinion on the matter and aren't ready to make one based on that one conversation between you two.


If you see something on social media that hits your moral compass the wrong way, it's because it's structured to do that, make it seem like a black and white subject with no grey area. 


Don't be a part of what divides the world, make your own opinion on a matter based on logical or factual information rather than your/others biases.


Edit: Had to make a second post due to the lack of LPT at the start and now I dun goofed the title. Sorry about the typo.
