LPT: To get a small child to stop crying, ask them what colors various things around them are.

content:
If a kid is screaming their head off because they're going to bed or something but then you ask them what color their shirt is, 9/10 times they'll stop crying to tell you. Keep doing that with different things and pretty soon they'll forgot they were ever crying. This works for any time you need to distract them. 

You can use this concept for other situations too. If they're not eating their food, ask them what it taste like. Stuff like that.
