title:
If your baby or small child is waking up too early, put him or her to bed earlier, not later. This is counter-intuitive but it works and is easily explained biologically.

content:
We found this out after our first son was waking at 5 am. Friends had the same problem with their daughter, so they kept putting her to bed later.  

We were told by a paediatrician to put our child to bed earlier.  With a 7 pm bedtime, he slept until 6:30. We adhered to the bedtime like we were OCD and it was magic.  

Our friends stuck to their plan and ended up with a midnight bedtime claiming that they had to because she would wake too early otherwise. She made up for the lost sleep by napping.

Edit - just saw that I was supposed to preface this with LPT but didn't and cannot edit the title now.  I hope I don't get deleted.
