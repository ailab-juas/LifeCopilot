YSK: How to Use Plex Media Server Without Internet Access

content:
After having used Plex server @ home on different TV's with no issues a recent update( months ago?) broke the DLNA function on one of my TV's , forcing me to have to login to Plex online before i could get my content.

But today i stumbled on [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/303282/how-to-use-plex-media-server-without-internet-access/) article from howtogeek and i am on happy camper. 

No more having to go thru 3 different menus to watch my content!.
