YSK: You do not have to suffer in order to be “good” or to do something good or well

content:
Why YSK: sometimes you may encounter an attitude that something only counts as “good” or worthy of goodness or respect if you suffered. 

For example: 

Good work ethic (e.g if you’re having fun working you must be lazy)

Learning or achieving a degree (“rigorous” curriculums that make students super stressed/“weed people out”)

Doing a good deed (e.g it should be somewhat difficult and/or you should get no recognition and don’t seek recognition for it to “count”) 

Achieving a goal or completing a project

Being a good person 

The list goes on…


The requirement of “suffering” seems to me to be rooted in some archaic puritanical thinking. You don’t have to suffer to be good to do something well. It’s not a prerequisite.
