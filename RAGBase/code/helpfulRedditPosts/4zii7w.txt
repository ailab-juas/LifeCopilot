LPT: (for the Brits) talk to the ticket master at your local station. They'll work out a journey for you taking the cheapest routes to save you money, especially if you're a student. You'll save up to 60%.

**EDIT 3**: (putting it up here because it's important) I've inly just realised that there seems to be a lot of confusion here between TicketMaster, the website, and an actual physical human selling you tickets. I am English, but have never lived in the country. As such, my knowledge of the language and customs are flawed. I thought that a ticket master was someone who sold tickets, just as a station master is someone who runs the station. The LPT here is to approach an **actual physical human being who sells tickets**.

All you need to do is ask them if they can help you find a cheaper route to where you need to be. If they're nice and not too busy, they'll sift through all the connections and find you a journey that works. 

It's especially good for short notice train journies too. The ticket master in Cobham (amazing guy, very friendly - spent ten minutes going through options to find the cheapest route) managed to cut down my journey cost to Penzance from £150 to £64.90. I don't have a credit card, I didn't have any family around, and I had just £65.00 cash. If he hadn't found me that ticket, I'd have been stuck with nowhere to go. Thanks to him, I got down to Penzance, met up with my uncle, and now I'm staying with my Granddad till university starts. The ticket man was a hero, and I probably owe him a pint when I'm next up there.

**EDIT**: Okay, a few notes. This isn't a universal LPT. First of all, it's directed at Brits, because I don't know if it would work elsewhere. Second, it's largely directed at those in smaller outlying stations, and obviously at those using stations with actual people selling tickets. Furthermore, I recommended this in particular as a means of buying tickets if you have to buy them last minute. If you're buying in advance, however, it might still be worth going to your station to see if you can find anything cheaper. It's worth checking the online ticket companies, but in general they hide the cheaper options, like those that go via many different stations rather than direct (particularly the websites run by the train companies themselves - that way they make more money). 

And notably, a lot of people have pointed out that you have to get lucky and get someone friendly to be given this sort of help. True, if they're grumpy, unfriendly, having a bad day, or something like that, they might not help. But try being friendly, polite, nice, and cheering up their day - they're not working the nicest job in the world. 

As for the particular guy who helped me, another Redditor reminded me that his name is Steve. From what I know, he's worked there at least a decade. He's a brilliant guy, very friendly, and if anyone's travelling through CSD, drop in and say hi, tell him he's awesome for me, and be friendly to him.

**EDIT 2**: so the comments seem pretty divided. A lot of Brits/tourists have had similar experiences. On the other hand, a lot of people say that it's almost impossible to find someone helpful like that. I think the reason is disposition - if you're unfriendly and negative, or even just not particularly friendly, they'll be less inclined to help. On the other hand, if you're nice to these people, who are unfortunately working jobs that are fairly tedious and not too pleasant, maybe you'll be that ray of sunshine that brightens their day, and they'll return the favour.

**EDIT 4**: as many people have pointed out, you can save a lot with a railcard, if you qualify for one of them. But obviously if you get a cheaper ticket *and* have a rail card, you're saving even more. Just note that a railcard costs thirty pounds a year (for a student one, anyway), so if you spend less than ninety pounds on long distance rail travel a year, you're losing out.
