LPT: If you overhear someone say “I wonder if we need a booking?” - make the booking, for the love of happiness just make a god damn booking.

Especially at this time of year. I used to work in restaurants and the amount of times a family of 12 would rock up for Sunday lunch and be heartbroken/aggressive that theres no space for them was staggering. 
Like just call the place before you get in the car. Have a plan, because you’re competing against anyone who also wants to go out for lunch and they’re nice with it.
