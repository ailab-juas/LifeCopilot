LPT: When involved in a auto accident, ALWAYS take a photo of the ID plates of all cars involved first.

Edit: To clarify to the people stating the obvious ... This is after making sure all parties are OK and nobody needs emergency assistance. 

TL;DR: Take a photo of any cars tags in an accident you are involved in. There's no guarantee all parties are good people and stay. 

This happened to me yesterday. Gold Ford Focus(?) on highway in Orlando lost control and sideswiped my car. We pulled over and I checked on my wife and little one (who were ok) and the dude in the lost control of his car pulled over to see if we were ok and to pull his now-torn off bumper from the middle of the highway. Nevertheless, minutes later (while I'm on the phone with the police) he speeds off leaving his bumper behind and us with no info to identify him (tag was still on the car and not on left behind bumper).
