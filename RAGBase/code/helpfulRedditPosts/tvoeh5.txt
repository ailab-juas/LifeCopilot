LPT: Don’t be afraid to do things normally done in groups on your own

content:
It’s not weird to go to movies, concerts, sporting events, etc alone. I’ve learned this by moving to new cities where I’ve known no one. The first few times my anxiety made me feel like everyone knew I was a loner and I didn’t belong. Now I almost prefer it. 

And you also meet people going places alone. If your passion for your hobbies outweigh the need for social support, people do generally respect that, and you’ll end up making friends along the way because of it
