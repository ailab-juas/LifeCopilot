LPT: If you have a healthy relationship with your family and friends and then suddenly don't after dating someone new. Question the relationship, not the friends and family.

Apparently I have to clarify this isn't saying: if your racist dad doesn't like your new relationship trash the relationship. 

I'm saying: if you have a healthy relationship with your parents, siblings, cousins, grandparents, aunts, uncles and friends and then suddenly don't, question the new relationship not your friends and family.

Also, it's question the new relationship, not trash it immediately upon any hardship. You could learn that your family is actually using or abusing you or that you don't actually have a healthy relationship with them from an outside perspective. 

This also obviously doesn't apply to racism / homophobia / other inexcusable human traits from your family.
