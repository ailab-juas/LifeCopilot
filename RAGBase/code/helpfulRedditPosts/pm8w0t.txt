YSK that if you Google/search for a gift card balance check, make sure you click on the retailer's legitimate website

Why YSK: This morning I found a Target gift card in my closet. I Googled "Target gift card balance" so that I can see if it actually has money in it. The first result was an ad, and I noticed that the website domain was totally unrelated, but when I clicked on it, the page looked exactly the same as Target's. This is definitely a scam. If you put your card number and access code, they will steal it and you can kiss your balance goodbye.
