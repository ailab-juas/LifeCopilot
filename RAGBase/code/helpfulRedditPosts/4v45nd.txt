LPT: When you're procrastinating, do something that is extremely easy and quick. This will get your motivation pumping.

Remember this: ACTION COMES BEFORE MOTIVATION





Procrastination is terrible. A majority of people have the wrong idea- they sit around and wait for some inspiration or sudden motivation to hit them before doing anything. They might as well sit around forever. 



Action comes first.  Action gets your motivation pumping. Start by doing something small, maybe as simple as getting up and throwing your fast food garbage away. That's action. Then you will gain a little motivation and want to do something else, thus even more motivation. It's a snowball effect. 



Example:  you have a big paper to write for your class, but you are stuck procrastinating. Get up and brush your teeth, or get up and do anything quick and easy that is completely unrelated to doing your paper. You have to prime the pump.
