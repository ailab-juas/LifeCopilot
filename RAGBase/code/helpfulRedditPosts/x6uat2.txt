title:
YSK: homeowners, you should clean your outdoor A/C compressor units regularly

content:
Why YSK: the outdoor A/C Compressor unit is probably not something you ever think about. But the unit collects a huge amount of gunk, dust, dirt and grime, making it far less efficient and shortening the life of the unit. Cleaning the condenser coils regularly (once a year is recommended) will make it run much better. I am guessing most people know to replace the inside air filter, but never think about the outside unit (at least that was me).

I have been a homeowner for 15+ years, and just discovered this in the past few months. I honestly never thought of the outdoor A/C unit as something that needed to be messed with. But after opening it up and seeing how gross it was, I can’t believe it worked at all. It was surprisingly easy to clean. 

Of course, if you get your A/C professionally serviced, they will do this. But I’d you’re like me and more of a DIYer, this isn’t probably something in most peoples radar.

I’m sure there are many guides out there on how to clean the A/C condenser coils, but here is one I followed:
