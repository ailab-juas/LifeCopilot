YSK that you’re better off giving close family you don’t want to have any money $1 from your will rather than omitting them altogether.

content:
My dad updated his will a little while ago; leaving me and my brother everything. Our sister was originally getting nothing (long story). The lawyer suggested that he give her $1, because she could argue he was either forgetful or not in the right state of mind while filling his wishes out. So if you don’t want anyone questioning the integrity of your “spotty” mind, give them a buck to remember you by. 

Edit: i have only watched the first few episodes of better call Saul, up to when mike gets recruited or something. Honestly purely coincidental. But I guess r/nothingeverhappens

My sister has been abusing drugs and alcohol, dropped out of school, arrested for DUI’s, arrested for stealing medication (and breaking and entering) from an old folks home, and the father of her daughter is a registered sex offender and is on the Megan’s law website

Sorry about the r/titlegore. One of those things you don’t realize until it’s too far gone

Lastly, I never said blindly do it. In my experience (in Pennsylvania, USA), it was highly suggested by our trusted family attorney. I never expected a decent response to this post.... I just figured I could provoke a few people’s minds into looking into it to save you / your loved ones hassle later on. 

Edit #2: I’m aware that you can state you don’t want to give someone something. My dad was just advised of giving $1.
