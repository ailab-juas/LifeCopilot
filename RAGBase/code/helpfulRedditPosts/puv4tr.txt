LPT: Create an email address for your car.

content:
This has worked so well for me. You can send everything regarding the car to it: maintenance records, gas receipts, registration, even pictures of it before you let a friend borrow it or leave it parked for a while (for insurance reasons).  Doing this keeps everything in one place and puts a time/date stamp on everything you send it.  When you sell the car, you can turn over the email address or just forward the new owner everything that's relevant.  

Bonus: this also works great for a house!

edit:  Yes 243 commenters, we all know about gmail folders and Dropbox. This is just a nice, clean, fun way to do things.  Enjoy your folders!  But seriously, protonmail people, way more secure.
