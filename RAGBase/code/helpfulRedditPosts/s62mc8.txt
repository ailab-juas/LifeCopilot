LPT : Label the water and natural gas shutoff valves in your home. Then show and explain them to your family. It may save your house and family in the future.

After seeing the recently posted video of the failed TV wall mount where water was gushing out of the wall, I decided to show my family all the shutoff valves in the basement again.  When I realized they may forget in a panic situation (there are five valves in a four foot span on the wall with my water inlet pipe) I decided to neatly label them to eliminate that chance.

Five minutes to save your home and maybe even your family's lives one day.  Stop scrolling and do it now.
