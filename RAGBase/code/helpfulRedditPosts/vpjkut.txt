LPT: If your SO doesn't know where they want to eat, make suggestions based on flavours and textures, not actual dishes or restaurant locations.

content:
Ask some questions, do you want something crunchy? meaty? light? soupy? zesty? spicy? This will bring up cravings and you'll be sure to settle on a decision in no time.

Don't get caught up in where you want to eat, or even what you want to eat, but talk about the properties of the food instead.
