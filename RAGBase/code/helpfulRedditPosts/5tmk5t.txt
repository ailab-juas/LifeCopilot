LPT: If you use your laptop for work, create a separate user for presentations. This will prevent embarrassing pop-ups or web history.

I've seen people open their browser and it shows their porn history in the first tab and another guy had his text messages display on his screen. A buddy was texting asking if he wanted "to get fucked up" after the meeting.

This can be avoided by creating a user that you only use for presentations and only grant access to office related programs.
