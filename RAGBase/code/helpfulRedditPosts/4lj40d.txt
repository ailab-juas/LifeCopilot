YSK that EPUB files are basically just compressed HTML files. You can rename them from ".epub" to ".zip", unpack them anywhere, then read/bookmark them with any web browser.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB):

&gt; **An EPUB file is a ZIP archive that contains, in effect, a websiteâ€”including HTML files, images, CSS style sheets, and other assets.** It also contains metadata. EPUB 3 is the latest version. By using HTML5, publications can contain video, audio, and interactivity, just like websites in web browsers.

Clearly EPUB is a great format for eReaders, I'm just pointing out that you can read EPUB files without installing an eReader if you want to, just by unzipping it.
