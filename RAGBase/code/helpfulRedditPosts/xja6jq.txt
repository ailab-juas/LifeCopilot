YSK if you're hosting a party and you have guests arrive early, you can deal with the awkwardness/rudeness by putting them to work on building the party.

Why YSK: After all, of they want to arrive before you've had time to "place the veil" of the party (decorate, make food, clean), then they can help you build it.

This isn't meant to be a slight at the very similar previous post about guests arriving early, just sharing how I dealt with it when it happened to me. And you know what? I still had all my guests regularly show up with about half of them early each time.
