YSK: If you are leasing a car and the end of the lease is coming up DO NOT JUST RETURN THE LEASE TO A DEALER WITHOUT FINDING OUT HOW MUCH THE CAR IS ACTUALLY WORTH

Why YSK: 

Car values are *insane* right now and most people who got into leases before the market went crazy will have a good amount of equity stored up in the car compared to what the buyout amount is. 

Call the financial institution your lease is through (if you don’t know who your lease is through just Google “#your car’s manufacturer here# lease company” to find out) and get a “dealer payoff” amount from them. 

Once you know your payoff amount take your car to a few different dealers that sell that brand (It HAS to be a dealership that sells YOUR brand because finance companies are generally not allowing lease vehicles to be sold to third party dealers) and tell the dealership only that you’re shopping around to sell it and you want to get their offer to buy it from you. (DO NOT TELL THEM IT’S A LEASE RETURN)

 Once you get a number you like and begin to do the paperwork to sell the car to the dealer, *then* you can tell them there is a payoff amount and that it’s a lease.

Dealers would be SO happy to just take the vehicle back without you knowing what it’s actually worth. I have seen people return their lease and miss out out on nearly $10K because they didn’t know they had the option to SELL their lease vehicle.

IMPORTANT EDIT: *You* do not have to buy out your lease first to sell your car. When you sell the car to the dealer just mention to them that there is a payoff on the vehicle still and they will get the necessary info to pay the lease off on YOUR behalf just like they would if you traded a car with a payoff still on it.
