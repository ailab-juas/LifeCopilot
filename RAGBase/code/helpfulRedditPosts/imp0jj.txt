title:
YSK that body-shaming yourself doesn’t make you look down-to-earth or humble. It makes other people uncomfortable because they don’t know how to respond.

Why YSK: People confuse self-deprecating humor with pure self-deprecation in social situations all the time and if you do this, it’s probably not coming across the way you want it to. I (26f relatively fit person), for one, never know what to say when an overweight girl calls herself fat around me. If I agree, I’m an asshole, and if I disagree, I’m a liar. So I end up just saying something stupid like “girl staaahhp lolz” and it’s just a waste of time because I’m not thinking about the fact that she’s overweight, I see a whole, unique and complex person when I’m talking to her. If you don’t like how you look, change your appearance if you can. If you like how you look, celebrate it humbly. Don’t make it someone else’s job to validate you.
