LPT: Do you miss reading good, challenging fiction but can't seem to get back into it? It's a skill like any other that needs to be kept up, try re-reading an old favorite to get you back in the game.

It's easy when you're a busy student or working adult to just fall down the rabbit hole of watching movies and reading non-fiction (both good things, but fiction is good for some of us, too). 

If you stop reading novels for a while, it can feel like there is a lot of inertia to find a good book and get into it. You're also pickier about books, I find, when you don't read them as often. 

Start off with re-reading one you know is a winner. Many good books actually improve on re-reading, and it's fun to revisit books that meant a lot to you in different parts of your life and see your different reactions.
