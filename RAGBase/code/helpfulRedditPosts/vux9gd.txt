title:
Ysk that professional chefs don’t cut like that to look cool. They do it so they don’t chop their fingers off.

Why ysk: The amount of home cooks or “internet chefs” I see that cut with their fingers flat or their thumbs out is absolutely staggering. Either make an Italian hand 
🤌 &lt;- like this but flipped over or make a hand similar to a falcons claw shape and let the knife slide against the **3rd knuckle** not the flat part. Keep in mind to tuck the thumb in. This isn’t just a pretentious chef thing. this is to save those *precious* fingies. I personally have seen many people cut themselves with flat hands and have even done it myself and I’ll tell you: slicing fast and catching on your fingernail quickly reminds you how human you are. 

You don’t need to cut fast, precise or pretty but you should cut safely! ^please

Edit: Some people also pointed out that a sharp knife is always safer! Sharpen *and* hone! Honing will make the bevel have less scoliosis. 


Edit: since a lot of people are asking “who thinks it makes them look cool?” I implore you to try and correct a middle aged home cook and see their reaction. Most people brush it off or become defensive. “I’ve been cutting like this for 600 years and I still have my fingers!” That doesn’t make it any safer George.
