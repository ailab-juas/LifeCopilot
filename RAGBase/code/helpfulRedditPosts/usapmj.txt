LPT: Learn to eat until you're content not full

content:
Most people tend to overeat. You feel much better when you learn to eat until you're content. Content means you're not hungry, but you're not full. Feeling curious is the best way to describe it. Once you're content, if you think you're hungry drink some water first. We often confuse thirst with hunger. Eat often, eat small, prioritize proteins first and you're on your way to a healthier lifestyle!
