LPT: If you are out of state and your insurance only covers ER visits in an emergency, call your plan’s 24/7 nurse line first. They will usually refer you to the ER to avoid “liability,” in which case they themselves declared it an emergency and you can avoid stressful billing disputes.

Not enough people know enough about nurse lines, so I’m posting this in the hopes it saves someone from crippling medical debt or never-ending billing disputes. Almost all major carriers have them. Often times the number is on the back of your insurance card, but if not google “[your plan] + 24/7 nurse line.” One of the main roles of the nurse line is to decide whether or not someone should go to the ER, and they typically do so very formulaically. Practically everything gets a referral. If they tell you to go then - emergency aside - you can rest easy knowing your finances won’t be ruined.
