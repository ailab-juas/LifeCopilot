LPT: Before you point out a problem, first think of a realistic solution to suggest.

content:
People are eager to brainstorm what's wrong, instead of brainstorming solutions. Before you bring a problem to a boss or even in a relationship, first think about a viable solution. Instead of being seen as a complainer you will be seen as a confident, assured, problem solver. People will soon ask for your advice giving you the opportunity to improve your status around the office.

Edit: Today I woke up to my typical eggs and bacon to find that my post made the front page! Thank you redditors! That's the most successful bathroom break I've had, I get to check off a bucket list item today.

Edit: To those who said this is bad advice without offering alternatives. I think you just proved my point. "If you are not a part of the solution, you are a part of the problem." ~ Eldridge Cleaver
