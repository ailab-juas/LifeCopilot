title:
If you have a new puppy or kitten, don't ever feed it first thing in the morning. They will grow up having no reason to wake you up.

content:
Make the morning as boring as possible, don't play with them, just ignore them for the first 25 minutes or so, I did this with my 2 cats and it worked perfectly.  They don't even wake up when I do, they stay in bed for about an hour then come downstairs to hang out.
