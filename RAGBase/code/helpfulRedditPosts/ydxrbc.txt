LPT: Never defend yourself by throwing a staff member giving you a break under the bus.

content:
Ex: A parking garage security guard lets you park in the CEO’s spot when you come in after 9pm. A new guard one day tells you that you can’t park there. DO NOT respond with “Well Security Guard X let’s me park here” 

The most likely result is you lose your parking cheat code and the guy helping you out gets reprimanded/fired.
