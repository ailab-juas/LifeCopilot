LPT: When it’s hot out (like now, in the northern hemisphere), consider leaving a frozen sports drink or bottle of water out for your mail carrier. Mail trucks do not have AC and it will be GREATLY appreciated

content:
Just make sure you tell your carrier it’s for them, or leave a note, otherwise they generally won’t take it. Heat indexes are outta control right now and I promise you, your mail carrier is sweaty and miserable.

Edited to add: The FedEx, UPS, and garbage pickup folks like cold drinks too!
