LPT: Feel like you're stuck in a day to day routine? Try listening to different or new music.

content:
I found myself stuck in a routine many times where listen to new music on the commute or at work really gave my day a different feel.

Edit: If you want something easy this is my daily driver. https://open.spotify.com/user/stickykeys_/playlist/1mU1YcmDtfBRDivbZVXep1
I always try to add new songs to it to keep my days refreshing.
