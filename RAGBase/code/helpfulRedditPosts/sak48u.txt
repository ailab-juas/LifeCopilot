YSK: If you're looking to help out around the house more, taking the mental stress of a chore away can be just as (if not MORE) of a relief to your partner than the physical part of the chore

**Why YSK:** A little bit of problem solving and self-management can really go a long way towards building a better relationship with your partner. It can be mentally stressful and frustrating for people to manage household chores alone. So often, when they're asking for help, what they're actually asking for is the freedom not to worry that something won't get done.

If you're asking questions about where to put things or find things or how and when to do things that adults should generally know how to do (or can easily look up online), you haven't actually removed any of the mental stress of that task. Whomever you're helping will still feel like they're going through the steps of the chore mentally even if they aren't physically doing it and that still leads to stress and mental energy spent on that activity.

On the flip side, if you find your partner relies too heavily on you to outline steps for them, try making lists and labeling items. Writing down what you do as an easily accessible reference can provide you both with a quick, easy way to answer questions. You can even take some time to do the chores and tasks with them so that it's understood and expected that they'll be asking questions and that you'll be involved in the process. Changing the context and expectations can really help with feeling of frustration and annoyance.

This can also apply to roommates, family, friends, colleagues, etc. Basically any relationship where chores or tasks can be shared and have become a source of stress or friction.
