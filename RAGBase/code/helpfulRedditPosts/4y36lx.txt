LPT: When giving change, place coins in the open palm BEFORE paper money and/or receipt

content:
I feel this should be taught at every retail job. I had no idea until my boss at a family owned toy store told me. This makes things much easier for the customer, reducing fumbling and the feeling of being in the way. Now, as a customer, it drives me crazy when I get a coin sandwich that I don't have time to manage.

FPE: Didn't plan on starting the next world war. Money really is the root of evil!
