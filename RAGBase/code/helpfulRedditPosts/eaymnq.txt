LPT: Reddit can be just as addicting, and mentally damaging as other social media. Take a step back every once in a while

content:
Lets be real, Reddit can be quite repetitive, frustrating, and sometimes straight up depressing (especially if you follow the news and politics closely), so it's nice to take a step back and leave it for a while.
I think that it helps me, especially around this time of year, to connect with the people close to me.

I'm not saying to quit Reddit forever, it's a great site. But a break can do you some good.

Edit: I’m surprised that so many people actually agree with this, but it makes me feel more sane knowing that I guess haha. Think I’ll take my own advice and leave Reddit for a while. Thanks for all the comments!
