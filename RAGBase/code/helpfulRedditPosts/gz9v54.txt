LPT: If you post photos or videos of yourself online, especially NSFW, remove all the embedded information beforehand

content:
A lot of people nowadays are posting sexually explicit media of themselves online, which is cool, but not necessarily smart.

You should take the time to protect yourself. Many phones automatically place location data, along with other metadata, like the model of your phone, within the media itself. 

You can configure your settings so your phone stops doing this. You can scrub the metadata even after the photo/video is created. 

Location metadata is very terrifying as often times the exact address of the location can be found, and some phones will straight up list it, or even show a map, in the details of the image/video for anyone who downloads it to find.

Protect yourself from stalkers. Delete location metadata.

Edit: many platforms automatically remove the data, but some don't.
