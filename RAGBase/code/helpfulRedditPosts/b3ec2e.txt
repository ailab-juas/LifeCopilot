YSK about Supercook.com, a site that tells you what you can make out of ingredients you have around.

content:
If you're anything like me, you might panic when stressed to make something out of whatever is lying around for company or for a 2-year old. This site tells you what you can make and if you're only 1 ingredient away, it will tell you what to go buy.
