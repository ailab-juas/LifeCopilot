LPT: If you insist on leaving valuables in your car keep a McDonald's bag handy as a disguise

content:
I keep them around because I'm filthy, not smart...but I can't count the number of times I've stuffed my camera gear/gps/new electronics purchases/purses in an empty McDonald's bag on the floor of my car. Rest easy knowing nobody will smash your window for McDonalds trash.
