LPT: If you have an especially good experience with a customer service person, (in addition to a nice tip, if applicable) be an "anti-Karen" and ask to speak to their manager about what a great job they're doing. It makes the employee's day and can help them get promotions.

I once had a manager who didn't like me that much, but the customers loved me and kept saying so, and now I have that manager's old job. Positive feedback is so rare in customer service. It's 99% complaints about stuff that isn't your fault. But those few kind words from customers helped me get through some hellish shifts and advance in my career.

Edit: Obvs this will vary from workplace to workplace and it can be inconvenient for the employee and manager in question if they're super busy at that moment. Comment consensus tips are: keep praise vague (they may have skirted policy to take care of you), mention the employee by name, fill out any survey on the receipt or at the end of the phone call with max scores and the employee's name so there's a record, tell the employee why you're asking for the manager so they don't get scared, leave a great name-drop review in online spaces, if sliding into the dms of a corporate account be sure to include the store location along with the employees name.

Edit 2: Some of y'all work for shitty managers. That sucks very much and I'm sorry. It's a bad situation that isn't your fault and you deserve better. I hope you'll be able to get out of that job soon and get into something better where you can shine.

Edit 3: "Wow, this blew up" time. Thank you for all the kind messages that came with the awards. They mean more than the awards themselves. It feels like you're telling my manager (reddit) that I'm doing a good job.
