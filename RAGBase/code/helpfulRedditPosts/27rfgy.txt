LPT: Don't rent a modem / router from your ISP.

content:
I've been renting the equipment from Comcast for over two years without thinking much about it.  After getting sick of paying them $8 / month for nothing, I decided to buy my own gear.  Instantly, my internet was double what it was before, and was closer to what I was actually paying for.  I had two modems/routers before that from them, each peaking at 2.5 Mbps (when I was paying for 5).  It has made a huge difference since!
