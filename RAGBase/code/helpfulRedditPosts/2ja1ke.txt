LPT - Don't use WD-40 to lubricate your bike chain. It contains a solvent and will actually breakdown the remaining lube on your chain.

content:
The light lubricant in WD-40 will last a couple of days before your chain starts chirping like a flock of birds is following you.

Get real bike chain lubricant from a bike shop to stop those squeaks and actually make you feel like you're pedaling faster.
