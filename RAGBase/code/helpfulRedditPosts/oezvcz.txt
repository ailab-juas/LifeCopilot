LPT: There's a difference between a genuinely messy house and one that merely looks lived-in. It doesn't always need to look like a museum if someone will see the inside. Not everyone requires, notices, or even prefers a house that looks like no one lives there.

I first noticed this years ago when I would go over to one of my friend's houses and I noticed how much more comfortable I always felt there. 

I realized it was because he wasn't a slob by any means, but he left mail on the front table, a dish or two in the sink, maybe his coffee mug and the paper was still in the living room somewhat askew from being read. It felt like coming into a home, not a showroom, and also communicated to the guest that they can just relax and makes themselves at home.

A lot of the time now, I find I need to tell people explicitly not to go crazy cleaning for me, it's OK to have a house in a normal state of usage. 

I was of the hotel-level of cleaning school until I made this realization. Now, if a worker or a friend is coming over, I just make sure the place isn't yucky messy or dirty, but having a few things out and not everything totally neat and hospital cornered is OK. I don't think people are as judgemental as many of us assume, and if it isn't even a friend or a relative, why do we care to prove how super neat we can be?
