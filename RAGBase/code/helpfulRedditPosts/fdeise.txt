YSK: You can improve your frozen pizza experience instantly by lightly oiling your crust

content:
Avid frozen pizza connoisseurs will know the struggle of a crust that's way too dry coming out of the oven, and putting it in for less time results in a flimsy floppy crust that disappoints you more than I disappoint my parents. Obviously there's a really tiny sweet spot that results in passable pizza, but it can still be vastly improved.

â€‹

A bit of olive oil (or any oil really) along the sides and bottom can help create a barrier between the heat of your oven and your crust and will prevent it from drying out. You will also be rewarded for your efforts with the most incredible texture on the bottom of your pizza that will absolutely make you crave more.
