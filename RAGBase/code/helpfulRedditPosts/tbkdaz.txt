LPT: Potatoes are cheap and easy to grow indoors or outdoors, and one potato plant can result in 5-10 potatoes easily. Don't be afraid to garden for staple foods!

I recently did some research on growing potatoes indoors as the cost of living rises, because potatoes are tasty, nutritious, and filling. I was pretty surprised by the results. Fabric indoor grow pots are $20-25 USD for 4-6 of similar sizes, grow lights can go for around $20 if you don't have enough natural light, soil is (literally) dirt cheap, and you can even make your own seed potatoes from a store-bought bag. For a relatively small investment, you can grow plenty of potatoes to feed yourself and your cohabitants. There are plenty of guides online for specifics, and it might just give you a hobby or interest to keep you sane and occupied in your free time.

Other plants can certainly be grown indoors as well, feel free to add other nutritious/easy options (especially those that can be done indoors) in the comments. It seriously blows my mind that more people don't garden for food and very few schools teach the possibility.
