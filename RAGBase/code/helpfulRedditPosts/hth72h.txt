LPT: Found a lost iPhone? Pull up the passcode lock screen, hit ‘emergency’ and then the ‘medical ID’ option. If the owner has input any info, it will be there.

My husband found an almost new iPhone while diving in a nearby lake. Surprisingly we got it to charge up and were able to locate the owner and return the phone using the medical ID. I know if it were my phone I would have been stoked to get that call!
