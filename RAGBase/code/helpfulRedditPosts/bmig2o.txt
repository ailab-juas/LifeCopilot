YSK Most human interference with wildlife causes more harm than good. You don't know what's normal for them, so please leave them be

content:
Though it may seem counterintuitive to our compassionate impulses, we humans don’t need to try to be surrogate parents to young birds we come across or any other any baby animals we see.

A number of wildlife offspring can be found at this time of year, but a frequent sight in yards throughout the region is young birds on the ground. In these instances, the parent birds (i.e., the true parents) often have the situation under control.

Any “rescue” efforts humans attempt often does nothing but botch things up and add unnecessary stress to what had been a completely normal routine.
