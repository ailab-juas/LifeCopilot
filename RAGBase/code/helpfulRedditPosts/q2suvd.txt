YSK: most men’s “cologne” is not actually cologne.

Men’s fragrances are generally referred to simply as “cologne” but technically speaking, most men’s fragrances are not actually cologne. A cologne is a specific concentration of a fragrance and is typically the weakest. The majority of men’s fragrances you’ll come across are going to be an EDT (eau de toilette) or EDP (Eau de Parfum).

Why YSK: Well in general, EDP is stronger and lasts longer than EDT, and both are generally stronger and last longer than cologne (EDC), though it of course can vary slightly. Like a fragrance but wish it lasted longer? Check if it’s an EDT, and if so, see if it has an EDP! That being said, sometimes an EDT and an EDP can actually have different scent notes, so keep in mind they may not smell the same! Typically speaking though, it’s unlikely you’ll run across true cologne in your general shopping.

Concentration strengths go from least to most concentrated: Eau Fraiche, Eau de Cologne, Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum, Parfum.

BONUS TIPS: As some people have stated, fragrance should be discovered, not announced. Even the best fragrances can be overwhelming if you wear too much. Another wearing tip is to take into consideration the temperature, time of day, and occasion when choosing a scent. There are some good all-rounders that are pleasant, though won’t make a statement (Acqua Di Gio, Bleu De Chanel, Versace Dylan Blue), while others don’t work in all settings, but in the right setting can really amplify your presentation. Spicy and sweet scents, for example, are best saved for colder temps, while bright and fruity scents are better for warm weather. Versace Eros is a great night-out fragrance, but would be somewhat out of place in an office setting, where Prada l'homme would be a sure thing.
