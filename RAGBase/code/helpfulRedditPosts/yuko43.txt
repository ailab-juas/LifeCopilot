LPT: Taking an ambulance will NOT get you seen faster at the ER.

DISCLAIMER: READ ALL EDITS.

Before you come at me in the comments talking about how your brother's sister's uncle's best friend's cousins called an ambulance and was seen faster because xyz, read the post in it's entirety.

Anyway.

The speed at which you are seen at the emergency room is determined based on the urgency of your problem.

Your problem may seem urgent to you, of course, but your broken arm will always come second to someone having an active heart attack. 

You can save yourself some money, and time, by driving to the ER **as long as you feel safe driving or have a driver.**

As an EMT in a busy 911 system, I promise you, I absolutely can and will wheel you out to the same waiting room you'd have walked into if you had driven to the hospital yourself.

EDIT:

Wow, this blew up. 

So just wanted to address one thing, this post is *not* intended to shame you out of taking an ambulance if you really need it. This post is more aimed towards those who think that their mildly annoying seasonal allergies are a sufficient reason to dial 911. 

If you are having symptoms of a stroke, heart attack, bleeding profusely, have burns to multiple places on your body, have any sort of penetrating trauma or multi-system trauma, ***call us.***

If you feel like you can't stand up on your own, if you don't have family/friends, or if your family/friends are unable to assist you to the ER, ***CALL US.***

By all means, we are here to serve you and respond to your emergencies. But if your situation isnt emergent, and you could fix your problem in several hours and be fine, then think twice about calling **emergency** transport.

EDIT 2:

"ThIs OnLy aPpLiEs tO tHe USA!!1!1!"

Only the "save you money" portion. That one was thrown in especially for my country, because we have a dystopian healthcare system. Yes, I am aware of this.

Taking an ambulance when it isn't a life threatening emergency in several other countries would likely result in the same wait time, because all hospitals have a triage system. 

If you don't need to be fixed *right this instant,* you will probably wait. That's just the nature of hospital care. 

You are being assessed and sorted by your presentation, condition, symptoms and severity of your illness/injury as soon as you walk through the door. As *soon as hospital staff lays eyes on you,* they can generally tell whether or not you'll be fit for the waiting room, or if you need to be seen immediately. This isn't exclusive to the US, and I know several emergency medical providers in other countries who can all confirm this.

"So you're expecting average people to assess themselves properly? You're putting lives in danger with this advice!"

If you *think* that your situation is emergent, call. 

Period.

That's literally my job. Give us a call and we'll show up.

All I'm asking is to think *a little bit* about what an emergency is, before you call an ambulance and tie them up. Because they can't respond to anywhere else until you're off the bus.

Did you stub your toe? Not an emergency. Even if it hurts real bad. 

Are you suddenly unable to move the right side of your body? **Emergency.**

Do you just feel kinda stuffy and weak today? You're probably sick. Take some over the counter meds and call your doctor to schedule an appointment. Not an emergency.

Do you suddenly feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest, and have radiating pain to your neck/jaw/shoulder? **Emergency.**

Imagine your family member is having a medical crisis that undoubtedly falls into the **super fucking emergent** category. 

Now imagine no ambulance is available at the time to respond, because someone wants their prescriptions refilled and doesn't feel like waiting in line at a pharmacy. So they called the only available ambulance to take them to the whole ass emergency room, just to refill meds. And we can't deny transport. So we're tied up with this person until they're signed for.
