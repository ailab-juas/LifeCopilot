YSK: If you’re traveling and your ID/passport gets lost or stolen, you can still fly home. Just arrive a few hours early to the airport, and do an interview with TSA so they can verify your identity. Having a police report is strongly recommended.

EDIT: This is useful for US domestic. I don’t know about other countries or international flight. 

Recently was in Chicago for a concert and some absolute trash people stole my girlfriends wallet. Obviously you can cancel the cards and dispute the charges, but the ID is usually the bigger issue. We went to the police to file a report mainly because we wanted official documentation to help us get home. The interview process with TSA was actually super quick and easy. They just made me stand off to the side so I couldn’t hear, but they basically just ask a few questions to verify your identity. Then they let us go through pre check. Hopefully this never happens to you though! 
This may seem like common sense but I had never thought about it before, until it was too late. Hopefully this helps someone.
