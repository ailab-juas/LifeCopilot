YSK that if your vehicle gets impounded/towed in the US, (for any reason, be it lack of insurance or forgotten ticket), after 30 days they can auction off your vehicle with no notification.

Why YSK, They will tell you $20 or so dollars a day to get it out, but what they don’t tell you is that after 30 days they can place a lien on your vehicle and auction it off to pay off that $1000 that you owe. I accidentally found this out recently and almost had my life completely ruined.

I’m just hoping somebody else’s life won’t be ruined.

Edit: as a lawyer pointed out in the comments, this may not be true in all states.  This was in Florida. I’m not a lawyer.
