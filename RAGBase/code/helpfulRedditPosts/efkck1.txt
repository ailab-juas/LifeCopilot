YSK that if you are over 65 you can get your tuition waved at any public university. Every state has something like this and in some states it’s as low as 60

content:
This is extremely useful especially for retired people. You could learn something new and maybe start a hobby. Take an art class or photography or get a better understanding of biology. Whatever you desire.

Edit: waived*

Edit 2: 

Here is a link to a list of the rules for all 50 states

Edit 3: since some have complained: **USA ONLY**

Edit 4: I understand how there could be some anger here. Trust me I’m 17 and leaving for college in just a matter of months. But please don’t direct that anger at me. Thank you to those who have been more nice and understanding.
