LPT: Unless you are exceptionally close to someone, don't ask why they don't have kids, why they didn't have more than one kid, or if they're going to have kids.

content:
It's none of your business and there's a very good chance they wanted kids or wanted more kids.  You're likely to put someone into tears after the conversation is over.
