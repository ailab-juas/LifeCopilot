title:
YSK a high percentage of Amazon's sale prices are fake markdowns

content:
Why YSK: Like most retailers, Amazon relies on your perceived savings to trick you into thinking you're getting a deal. A tool called CamelCamelCamel allows you to see an independent price history of that item. In most cases, the "was" price never happened, or was so brief it barely happened.

Points that have already been redundantly made:

1. Yes I know this is common. I put it in the original post. I'm talking about Amazon.  
a. For each time you tell me all retailers do this, a lightning bolt strikes a kitten.
2. Yes we don't like Amazon. Companies with lots of money are bad.  
a. Yes Amazon is actually bad. Every major retailer is in some way.
3. I've been made aware of Keepa and will try it out!  
a. other countries have some apps.
4. In some countries, this is illegal.
