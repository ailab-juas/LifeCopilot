LPT: in every new city you visit, allow yourself a $20 “idiot fee” before you get upset over any wasted/lost money

content:
I’ve been traveling around for a few months solo and little things just happen. You enter the subway on the wrong platform and have to buy another ticket, you missed the train that you were supposed to get because you got lost, late fees, I’ve gotten ripped off by several street vendors etc. Just remind yourself that it all goes to your allotted $20 idiot fee because you’re new here and it happens and you won’t make the mistake twice. I’ll only start to get hard on myself once my little mistakes cost me more than that $20 and it’s greatly improved my attitude with these small annoyances.  Adjust the number to whatever fits your lifestyle!

Edit: holy crap this exploded, thanks for sharing all of your silly stories guys! And to anyone leaving something negative it’s not about being able to afford the $20 it’s about keeping up the positive energy and going with the flow in little stressful hiccups, don’t be too hard on yourself and the universe will pay you back later :)
