LPT: Plumbers hate this one trick! - Blocked toilets

content:
Blocked toilets are a fact of life in the US with the traps having a diameter of small marble.  

But one really easy and mess-proof way to get rid of blocked toilets is just to add detergent and hair conditioner to the mix and leave for a while. 

And if the toilet is not overflowing, after adding the detergent/conditioner, add a pot of hot water to the bowl which will help soften things and help circulate the hair conditioner which will reduce friction between the blockage and the bowl.  (Often calcium/salt deposits from the water basically can leave the bowl like almost sandpaper which snags the paper etc). 

I've never had to resort to toilet snake or plunger since doing this, and everyone who I tell about this has said it works.
