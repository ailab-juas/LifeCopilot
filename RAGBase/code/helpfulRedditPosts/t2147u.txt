LPT: When getting into an Uber, close the door and open it again, pretending it didn’t close properly. This is a safety check to make sure the child lock isn’t on and so you can get out if comes to that.

This is something I do, as a guy whenever I get into an Uber. I can’t trust anyone after I was in an Uber and the child lock was on.
