**The many uses of WD-40 include;**

* Protects silver from tarnishing
* Cleans and lubricates guitar strings
* Gets oil spots off concrete driveways
* Gives floors that 'just-waxed' sheen without making it slippery
* Keeps flies off cows
* Restores and cleans chalkboards
* Removes lipstick stains
* Loosens stubborn zippers
* Untangles jewelry chains
* Removes stains from stainless steel sinks
* Removes dirt and grime from the barbecue grill
* Keeps ceramic &amp; terra cotta garden pots from oxidizing
* Removes tomato stains from clothing
* Keeps glass shower doors free of water spots
* Camouflages scratches in ceramic and marble floors
* Keeps scissors working smoothly
* Lubricates noisy door hinges on vehicles and doors in homes
* Gives a children's play gym slide a shine for a super fast slide
* Lubricates gear shift and mower-deck lever for ease of handling on riding mowers
* Rids rocking chairs and swings of squeaky noises
* Lubricates tracks in sticking home windows and makes them easier to open
* Spraying an umbrella stem makes it easier to open and close
* Restores and cleans padded leather dashboards and vinyl bumpers
* Restores and cleans roof racks on vehicles
* Lubricates and stops squeaks in electric fans
* Lubricates wheel sprockets on tricycles, wagons and bicycles for easy handling
* Lubricates fan belts on washers and dryers and keeps them running smoothly
* Keeps rust from forming on saws and saw blades, and other tools
* Removes splattered grease on stove
* Keeps bathroom mirror from fogging
* Lubricates prosthetic limbs
* Keeps pigeons off the balcony (they hate the smell)
* Removes all traces of duct tape
* Some folks spray it on their arms, hands, and knees to relieve arthritis pain.
* The favorite use in the state of New York: WD-40 protects the Statue of Liberty from the elements.
* WD-40 attracts fish. Spray a LITTLE on live bait or lures and you will be catching the big one in no time. It's a lot cheaper than the chemical attractants that are made for just that purpose. Keep in mind though, using some chemical laced baits or lures for fishing is not allowed in some states.
* Keeps away chiggers on the kids
* Use it for fire ant bites. It takes the sting away immediately, and stops the itch.
* WD-40 is great for removing crayon from walls. Spray on the mark and wipe with a clean rag.
* Also, if you've discovered that you have washed and dried a tube of lipstick with a load of laundry, saturate the lipstick spots with WD-40 and re-wash. Presto! Lipstick is gone!
* If you sprayed WD-40 on the distributor cap, it would displace the moisture and allow the car to start. (If I knew what a distributor cap was, it might help)
* WD-40, long known for its ability to remove leftover tape smunges (sticky label tape), is also a lovely perfume and air freshener! Sprayed liberally on every hinge in the house, it leaves that distinctive clean fresh scent for up to two days!
* Seriously though, it removes black scuff marks from the kitchen floor! Use WD-40 for those nasty tar and scuff marks on flooring. It doesn't seem to harm the finish and you won't have to scrub nearly as hard to get them off. Just remember to open some windows if you have a lot of marks.
* Bug guts will eat away the finish on your car if not removed quickly! Use WD-40!
