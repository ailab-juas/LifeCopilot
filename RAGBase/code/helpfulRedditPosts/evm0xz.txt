LPT: If you struggle to wake up and get moving in the morning, buy a stress ball or grip strengthener

content:
I have chronic anemia and ever since I was a little kid, I have never known the feeling of "waking up rested". Friends of mine describe waking up and immediately having the energy to jump out of bed. It is always a slow crawl for me to eventually muster the energy and drag myself out.

Last week I bought a grip strength trainer to strengthen my hands and left it on my nightstand. This morning, in my stupor, I decided to put a few rounds into it half-asleep. To my great surprise, I was wide away within 10-15 minutes from this simple act of exertion getting the blood flowing. 

Try it!! It's brainless and all you do is squeeze your hand a bit which pretty much anyone should be able to do! A stress ball should also prove to be an effective alternative

Edit: A couple of things to add, the anemia in question is a genetic mutation called thalassemia. It is the result of a blood mutation that causes my hemoglobin to decompose at an abnormal rate, thus hindering my blood's ability to deliver oxygen to the rest of my body.

While this was the first time I tried this, I posted to LPT because the effect was SO noticeable over everything else I've done to try and alleviate the morning fatigue. Memory foam mattress, getting to sleep earlier, morning wank, sleeping pills, melatonin, all these had a marginal effect if any at all. But today, BAM. I was up and moving around with no issues at all. I'll continue to trial this and keep you posted. I hope that others have success with this tip!
