LPT: when visiting London, or any other big European city don't fall for these popular scams

content:
A ["Cups &amp; Ball" scam](http://urbansome.com/urban-scams-1-cups-and-ball-scam-westminster-bridge/) is very popular on a Westminster Bridge in London. The idea is simple: there are three cups and one ball in scammer's hands. He then hides the ball under one of the cups and shuffles them around for 30 seconds or so. All you need to do is tell him which cup is the ball under and you win £10 (depends on how much you bet). Unfortunately, you will never get it right!

["Friendship Bracelet" scam](http://urbansome.com/friendship-bracelet-scam-paris/) is very popular in Paris, Rome and many other major cities. You will be approached by a “smiley” scammer who will say something like: “You look very happy, you need this magical friendship bracelet to make your relationship last forever”. And he will not give you a choice. While saying that, he will be already holding your hand and in a matter of seconds the piece of string (Yes! it is just a piece of string) will be on your wrist. Obviously, he will then demand a  payment for it.
