LPT: To study for a test, pretend you are able to have a cheat sheet and fill it with as many short and concise notes that would help you pass your test. By the time you are done, you will have successfully studied.

Whenever I had an exam and was able to make a cheat sheet, I never had to use it because of how much I reviewed in the process of making the sheet.

Edit: I go to sleep and this ends up on the front page! I hope this LPT helps as many people as possible!
