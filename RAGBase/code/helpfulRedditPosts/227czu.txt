LPT: To all my fellow students working on end of year projects / thesis - Back up your work!

content:
Back up your files! Every time you save your documents / spreadsheets / CAD models - upload them to a remote server such as Google drive or drop box, or e-mail them to yourself.  
I was using an older laptop and my hard drive just crapped out. If I hadn't followed this tip I would have lost a ridiculous amount of work.  
You know what's worse than doing your thesis? Doing it again.   
This applies to non-students as well.
