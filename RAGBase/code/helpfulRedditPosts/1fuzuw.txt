LPT: If your loved ones fall ill and have to go to a nursing home/hospice or have an in home caretaker, place all their jewelry and sentimental valuables and in a bank vault.

As an insurance agent in a predominantly retired area, this is a claim I see far too often.  Nursing home employees and caretakers are with your loved ones at their most vulnerable times.  It is far too easy for them to take advantage of the people they are entrusted to care for.  While most are trustworthy individuals, there are always a few that aren't.  While the insurance would pay for the jewelry, it can't replace the sentimental value of "your great grandmother's ring that has been in the family since the civil war."  

Edit:  Thank you everyone for adding your personal and professional advice to this tip.  It is a sad reality that this tip is needed.  I appreciate everyone sharing their experiences as well, the loss of a loved one is already difficult enough.  To lose the things they loved and would have helped you remember them by only adds to the tragedy.
