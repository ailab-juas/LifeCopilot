Why YSK: Persistent rumination can amplify the symptoms of some existing mental health conditions such as depression. 

 An endless loop of negative thoughts about our current suffering, which in turn creates even more suffering.
Conversely, by controlling our rumination we can [ease](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-stop-ruminating) our mental suffering and deal with conditions better.



Separating the ACTUAL negative feelings from ruminating thoughts is essential in Rumination Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (RFCBT). 

RFCBT was developed by professor Edward R. Watkins and his colleagues and it is showing promising results in helping people escape that mental loop.


[While standard Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) focuses on the CONTENTS of the dysfunctional thoughts, Rumination Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (RFCBT) focuses on modifying the THINKING PROCESS regarding those dysfunctional thoughts.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532251/)






I know depression or any other mental health conditions can feel overwhelming with no hope in sight, but understanding how the mind works might help. 
If you are currently suffering, please seek professional help and remember: 



You are not your thoughts. 


With love.
