LPT: Students, try to apply to one scholarship a week in high school... and don't stop when you get to college!

content:
A high school teacher told me that for every 50 scholarships I apply to, I should expect to receive, at most, one. This really encouraged (scared?) me to apply for one scholarship a week in my senior year of high school, and I wish I had started sooner.

I applied to over 50 scholarships and received four. I was extremely blessed that one was a full-ride to my dream school, but I'm also glad that I had a couple others to fall back on just in case. I give campus tours now and my top tip is to try to apply for one scholarship a week in high school. Treat it like homework with deadlines - a scholarship application due every Wednesday, for example. There are so many scholarships out there and they're all extremely different. One could simply ask for your name and email, while another could require three long essays and a video. It's tough but definitely doable to submit one a week!

And don't stop when you get to college! A lot of people forget that there are so many scholarships out there for those at any step in their undergrad career. In fact, I felt like I saw more for current undergrads than high school seniors when I was in high school. I've also seen a lot of scholarships even for middle school students, so you can start even earlier! Which I realize is getting a bit r/ABoringDystopia, but it's a sad fact that it's never too early to start saving for college. Scholarships were 100% necessary for my family and if they are for yours as well, I hope this tip helps.

Edit: thank you all for the comments! Just wanted to address some things:

1. This is obviously a tip for those in the United States wishing to go to college. There are many other paths to take in life and college is just one option! I wish our education system wasn't so financially INSANE but currently it is what it is. Scholarships were a necessity because of this. Go vote!!!
2. A few comments addressed that it's very difficult to apply for scholarships while having to work. I don't disagree! SAVE YOUR ESSAYS. I recycled so many essays and saved a ton of time, only had to make a couple minor edits. I think I used one essay for 15-20 different scholarships at one point. This made one a week a very doable goal!
3. The bigger scholarships took me much longer than one week to apply to - the full-ride private scholarship was a seven-month application process that required a huge application (with five essays), three letters of rec, and an interview. Obviously, it was worth it as it paid for tuition, room and board, fees, and some study abroad for four years. I know the big ones are timely but I'm telling you, they're worth it just to apply. Those who made it to the second round but not the third for my scholarship still got $4,000.
