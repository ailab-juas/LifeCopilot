LPT if you're looking for sports sunglasses try looking at safety glasses. You can get shaded, polarised, impact resistant glasses with full UV protection designed to be worn all day at a fraction of a price of a 'sports' brand.

Safety glasses are normally certified to recognised international standards and give you good field of view. Designs are also pretty modern.
