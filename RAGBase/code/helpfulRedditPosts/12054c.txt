LPT: Cool down your oatmeal in seconds.

content:
I make oatmeal at least 4 times a week for my family and got annoyed at having to wait for it to cool down while having it get super thick in the process. I came up with an idea and tried it and it works wonderfully:

Add frozen blueberries (you coukd probably use any frozen fruit, but I haven't tried others yet)! They thaw super fast and cool down the oatmeal almost instantly. Plus bonus fruit serving!
