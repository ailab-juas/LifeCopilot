LPT: If you are thinking about getting someone who's grieving flowers, consider getting them a nice pot plant instead

content:
Obviously, flowers are beautiful and appreciated. But the nicest gift someone got us when our son passed away was a pot plant.

All the flowers ended up dying at around the same time, but the pot plant is thriving to this day.

My wife and I now get lovely pot plants for people who have lost a loved one, and we get regular updates from them on how the plant is doing. 

And it doesn't end up being much more expensive than a bunch of flowers at all!

I guess it goes without saying that not everyone would like a pot plant - do it on a case by case basis. You don't want someone feeling extra guilt in keeping it alive if it's not for them. But for others, it'll be the perfect gift.
