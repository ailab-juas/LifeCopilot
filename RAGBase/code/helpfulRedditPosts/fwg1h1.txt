LPT: in order to fix your sleep cycle, don’t think about what time to go to bed. In stead, ensure you always get OUT of bed at the same time every day. No naps. No set bed time. Just get out of bed at a fixed time. That’s it.

content:
You won’t go to bed at 2 am if you consistently get out of bed at 7 am. If you always wake up at 7, you will automatically end up going to sleep around 12. The reason your routine is out of whack is because you don’t give a ruck about when you get out of bed, you focus only on when you go to bed AND you are failing at disciplining yourself on top of that. Every day you sleep a little longer and therefore get tired a bit later. Then you go to bed later and wake up even later etc. Etc. 

Just don’t be a bitch and have at least ONE minute of self-control when that alarm goes off. Even if you don’t set any “fixed” bed-time, you’ll be alright naturally.
