title:
YSK: Some Hotels offer a “bereavement rate” for funerals and emergencies.

content:
No one plans for these things so call the hotel and ask since these rates are not advertised. 
Also, if you have been flooded out of your home as a result of Hurricane Florence- ask the hotel if they have registered with FEMA to house victims. You will need to provide your FEMA registration number &amp; personal information.
