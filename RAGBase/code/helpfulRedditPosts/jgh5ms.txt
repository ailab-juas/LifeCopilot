title:
LPT: anytime someone insults you, respond with “Is that supposed to hurt me?”

content:
This is something my therapist recently told me and, after putting it to use, I can see why he recommended saying it!

It basically causes the other person’s brain to reset, making them feel as if they were caught in the act... even though they kind of were. It leaves them with two responses: no, which will cause them to walk on eggshells, or yes, which will not only make them look childish, but cause them to run out of things to say, too. Side note, almost no one will ever say yes.

It’s non-conflicting, non-instigating, and, it strangely deescalates any argument from growing.
