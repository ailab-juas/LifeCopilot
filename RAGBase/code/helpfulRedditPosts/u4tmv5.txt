LPT: Your parents are just regular humans trying to figure their way in the world just like you. They don’t know everything.

I often say that we become adults when we realise this fact about our parents (or whoever raised you). They’re not omnipresent and all-knowing, they’re just trying to make the best decision they can at the time much like ourselves. I think some people never find this realisation and those are often the people that live by their parents law until late in their life
