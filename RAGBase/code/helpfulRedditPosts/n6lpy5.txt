LPT: If you have low self-esteem it could be because you are comparing your own flaws with others so stop doing it, there is a logical explanation why you shouldn't.

Because you're aware of all your flaws, while being aware of only a fraction of other people's flaws, by comparison, you think you're worse. You're not worse. It's just that you can't hide your own flaws from yourself as well as people can hide theirs from you.
