LPT: If you sacrifice, or work hard for someone else’s benefit and they realize it on their own, they think, “what a wonderful person.” If you point it out to them, they think, “what a whiney jerk.” So keep it to yourself. If you need the appreciation, maybe you’re doing it for the wrong reason.

Yes, it’s ok to enjoy being appreciated. No, you shouldn’t let people take advantage of you.

Obviously this tip is not about your job. If you’re working hard you should let your employers know. 

The point is, in a relationship, constantly pointing out what a martyr you are probably isn’t going to earn you respect, just contempt. And it may indicate that you need to change your mindset. Plus, knowing that you’re sacrificing for someone else without trying to gain from it can be satisfying.

Also, the other side of this is implied: show appreciation when people do things for you, without them having to point it out.


The last half of the tip may have been more harsh than I intended, but that’s because it was aimed at myself.

I was inspired to post this when I realized how much I wanted to find ways to bring up to my family how hard I work at my job, how long I suffer through traffic, how much I do when I get home, etc. 

I had to ask myself why I needed them to praise me for it. I realized it was time for me to man-up and do whatever it takes to support them, regardless of whether I’m applauded for it. I needed to shift my perspective: why should I be bitter about working hard for people I love, rather than reveling in the chance to be of service!? If they realize how much I do, great! If not, I can feel good just knowing how much I’m doing for them.

P.S. Wow, that’s my first award! That means a lot to me, thank you! I appreciate it! 😄
