title:
YSK if your face wash has retinol in it, DONT GET YOUR FACE WAXED

content:
Why YSK: I just remembered this painful story  after watching an ad for Pro-Active and felt I had to share. 

I used to get my eyebrows waxed fairly often. Never had any issues and we made sure to go to a place that used organic products. One day I decided to start using Pro-Active on myself. I don’t think it helped my acne, but it did have another affect! CHEMICAL BURNS AFTER WAXING MY EYEBROWS. 
My eyelids and the areas under my brows were bright red. The top layer was burnt off and it hurt for weeks. 

Just a small tip. If you change your face care routine at all...let the aesthetician (person who does your waxing) know.


EDIT: [This article](https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a26287552/skin-ripped-off-during-wax-what-to-do/) goes more into why using retinol with wax can be dangerous. I think mixed with whatever my aesthetician was using, I got a very severe version of what she talks about. [this is not me in the article nor me in the photos]

EDIT 2: apparently my wording has caused anger within the bowels of another human. I should say don’t put retinol on sensitive areas of your face or any skin really ESPECIALLY if you’re going to wax.
