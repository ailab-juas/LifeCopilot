LPT: If you’re on the fence about buying anything ask yourself “if I had to choose between being given this item or it’s equivalent value in money, which would I take?”

For example, I want new boots that are $200. Imaginary magic being offers me boots in one hand or $200 in the other. I can only pick one. 

Most of the time I pick the money! But every now and then I pick the item. Something to help y’all save some money when making purchases :)
