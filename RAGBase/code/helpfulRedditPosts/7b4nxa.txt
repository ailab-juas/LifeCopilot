LPT: If you find yourself waking up an hour earlier than normal — because of daylight savings time — now would be a good chance to start a workout routine.

I know that one big road block that prevents me from working out (besides the fact that working out sucks) is the lack of time. Now that I’ve gained an extra hour, I’m planning  on utilizing it to improve my life.

**Bonus Tip:** working out in the morning gets your metabolism fired up for the whole day, as opposed to working out at night. 

**EDIT:** Thank you for the gold, kind stranger! Also, I get that this tip won’t work for everyone. It’s a BIG “if,” and I understand that. But as one user articulated it better than me, it’s more about taking advantage of creating a new routine while your circadian rhythm is adjusting. It’s always a good time to start being healthy, and getting sleep is also healthy, so if that’s what you choose to do with your extra hour, so be it! 

**EDIT 2:** Daylight SAVING — singular — got it! Can’t change the title now though. Sorry :(

**EDIT 3:** Apparently the Bonus Tip I mentioned is triggering some controversy. [Heres an article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.elitedaily.com/life/theres-big-difference-working-morning-night/1035312/amp) that talks about the benefits of working out in the morning as opposed to the evening. At the end of the day, exercise is good for you no matter what. However you can make it work, it will benefit you.
