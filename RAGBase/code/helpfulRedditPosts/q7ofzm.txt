LPT: Be prepared to not have a job anymore the moment you put your 2-weeks notice in.

content:
Employers can terminate your employment at any time, in many states, for no reason whatsoever (called at-will), and though you may think "I will have 2 weeks to work here still," that is not always the case. I personally have had this happen whereas I put my notice in, and immediately management says "alright, well, today is your last day then," and had me turn in my gear.

"Unprofessional" only works one-way sometimes. What do you say to them when they do it to you?
