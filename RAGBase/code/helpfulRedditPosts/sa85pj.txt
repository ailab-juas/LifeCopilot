YSK: One large 18” pizza is larger than two 12” mediums.

content:
Why YSK: because two mediums is typically more expensive and more crust. There’s the topping variety argument, but you can always do half and half. 

π r ² = area

[2 mediums] 3.14 x 6 ² x 2 = 226.08

[1 large] 3.14 x 9 ²  = 254.34


It’s blowing my mind and my world is upside down.
