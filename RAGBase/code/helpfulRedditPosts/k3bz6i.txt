LPT: Take regular photos of the everyday happenings around your home &amp; family. Someone on the sofa, cooking, doing yard work, a regular old dinner etc. The big milestone events are memorable enough and easily reminiscenced. Pictures of everyday life are the real nostalgia bombs when looking back.
