LPT: If you are bad with names, let people know when you first meet them. You will be more comfortable admitting you forgot, and for many people it's a relief that they don't need to feel bad about forgetting yours straight away either.

There are a lot of name 'hacks' out there for remembering names but if you're like me, they don't usually work. Many people try asking how the person spells their name when they forget it, but that backfires, trust me. I asked a guy called Tim how to spell it :/. Asking for the name and then saying "no your last name" sounds great in theory but is incredibly transparent irl. Please, just give up on these tips and be honest.

When you first meet someone let them know you are bad with names, and that although you are trying your best you will probably forget theirs. Apologise pre-emptively. They will feel less offended and you will feel more comfortable asking for the name when you forget it. It also is a huge relief to 50% of people who immediately admit that they too will struggle with your name. From then on both parties can comfortably ask for a reminder of the other's name, and sometimes I have found it to be a good method for starting a more personal conversation. When you admit a weakness the other person feels less pressured and talks more naturally as well.

Seriously just do it. I am over the moon when people I meet say the same thing and I can feel less awkward about my own social networking abilities. You might be surprised just how many people struggle with the same problem.

Edit: My first gold! Thank you kind stranger!
