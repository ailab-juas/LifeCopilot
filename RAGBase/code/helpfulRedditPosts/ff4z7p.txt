LPT: Put as much effort into developing your personal life as you do your work life. Your long term happiness will thank you for it.

content:
We spend 12+ years mostly learning the basics of what we need for careers, and are heavily discouraged from many things that we love just for the sake of loving, not necessarily to make money out of it. What that means is by the time most of us are adults, we don’t have many fun hobbies beyond the relatively simple ones- watch tv, read, maybe play video games or go to the gym. Take the time to develop your social circle and get in tune with community groups, and learn hobbies that require more than passive engagement. Long term you’ll enjoy your time and where you live more.
