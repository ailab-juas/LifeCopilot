YSK about bismuth subgallate, an "internal deodorant" to make flatulence less smelly

content:
If you've ever eaten something that has disagreed with your GI tract, essentially turning you into a walking fart factory, bismuth subgallate is here to help. 

While it may not reduce your gas-load, it will make them less smelly; reducing your paint-peeling anal winds into a nice spring breeze in your pants.*

While there are a few brands which market themselves as an "internal deodorant," make sure the one your getting actually has bismuth subgallate, instead of something with "all natural cellulose bullshit." 

You might notice this stuff is fairly expensive at roughly 20 bucks a bottle. Just understand that each bottle will last a while, especially if you only use it occasionally, such as not wanting to melt the nose off your date after you ate 10 servings of bean dip and chugged 5 gallons of chocolate milk. 

How does it work? Honestly I have no idea. It's probably witchcraft or something. Perhaps the bismuth subgallate binds to the aerosolized shit particles and teleports them elsewhere.
 
Be aware that if you're allergic/sensitive to pepto bismol, you shouldn't take this stuff either as they're chemically similar.


*Individual results may vary. For exceptionally smelly farts, you should probably take a shit.
