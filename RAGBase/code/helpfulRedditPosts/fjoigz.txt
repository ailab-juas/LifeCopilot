title:
LPT Make Irish Soda Bread if the Grocery Store runs out of Bread

content:
Irish soda bread takes less than an hour to make and it's a very forgiving bread. Unlike some bread/pastries it still tastes good even if you mess it up.

Here is the recipe I use : https://www.recipetineats.com/no-yeast-bread-irish-soda-bread/

I substitute buttermilk for 2 cups milk and 1.5 teaspoons of lemon juice (you can also use vinegar)

The bread rises through the release of gas cause by the baking soda reacting to the lemon juice. As such, it's important to get it in the oven quickly (within 3 minutes) once you mix the wet and dry ingredients. I recommend prepping everything you need before you start mixing.


Good luck, and stay safe!


ETA:

u/shesaidgoodbye gave a good recipe for beer bread in the comments that may also work if you are wanting a sweeter bread.


&gt;3 Cups Flour (wheat if you prefer and want additional fiber)

&gt;12 Ounces Beer

&gt;¼ Cup Brown Sugar

&gt;¼ Cup Butter (softened)

&gt;1 Tbsp Baking Powder

&gt;1 tsp Salt

&gt;How to make it:
&gt;Sift the three cups of flour into a medium size mixing bowl (make sure that you don’t use 3 packed cups or you’ll have a much less moist bread). Add all of the rest of the dry ingredients and mix well, then add the beer of your choice and the room temperature butter and blend again. Lightly dust a bread pan with flour or coat it sparsely with grease and distribute your dough evenly throughout, smoothing over the top. Bake for 60 minutes at 375°.

You can leave out both the sugar and the butter if you need to do so as well
