YSK the easiest way to make sure your kid fights you on every chore is to avoid saying "thank you."

content:
I'm a teacher. Every year, I get at least one parent who tells me that they just expect their kids to do their chores, and they won't ever say "thank you" for doing them. Then these parents wonder why their kids fight them on chores. 

These same parents often tell me they don't understand why their kids put so much effort into my class. 

It's really very easy. I thank them for their answers in class. I thank them for helping their classmates. I thank them for picking up after a lab. I thank them when they give their presentations. 

Every opportunity I have to do it, I say "thank you." 

My mom always gave me an enthusiastic "thank you!" when my sister and I did chores. As a result, we always did them, often without being asked. We said "thank you" when she made dinner. 

A home culture of saying "thank you" is a very easy and effective way to improve adult/teen relationships, and you'll have happier teens too.
