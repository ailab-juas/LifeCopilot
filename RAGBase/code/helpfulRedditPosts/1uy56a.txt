LPT: Have sleep-onset insomnia (difficulty falling asleep)? Stop thinking with words and think with images instead.

content:
When we are awake, the part of the brain (roughly, the outside layer) that controls the language is “in control”. When we're asleep, it's the inside that takes on. The moment you can fall asleep is the moment you give up your articulated thoughts and start thinking only in images and abstract sounds. I've had sleep-onset insomnia for 20 years and this method changed my life.
