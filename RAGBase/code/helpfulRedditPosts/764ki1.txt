LPT: Mention in your will that you want a cheap casket/gravestone

content:
Funeral Directors are businesses like any other and will usually prey upon mourning vulnerable loved ones. The family of the deceased feel bad "cheaping out" and will buy any expensive services suggested to them. Do your mourning family one last favour and take the choice away from them.

Or as /u/FluffyBlizzard suggests; just buy it beforehand.
