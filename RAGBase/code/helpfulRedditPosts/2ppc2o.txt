YSK if your sink's flow rate is getting worse over time, you need to clean the faucet strainer

content:
I just doubled the flow rate of my kitchen sink by cleaning off the little mesh screens inside the faucet. Mine has three screens with different mesh sizes. I reassembled it with the largest holes on the water side and the smallest holes on the sink side. I highly recommend taking pictures as you take it apart as mine wasn't very obvious to me the first time.
