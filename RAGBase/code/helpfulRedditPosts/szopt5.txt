LPT: Getting a raise is more difficult than negotiating a job offer. Switch jobs every 1 to 2 years and negotiate on the offer if you want to be less poor.

NOTE: This probably only applies to career level jobs.

EDIT: YMMV. In my industry this is common, but in others it may not be. Attenuate your tenure to what is acceptable in your industry so that you are not considered a job-hopper.
