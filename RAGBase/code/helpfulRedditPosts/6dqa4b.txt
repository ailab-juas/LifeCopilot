LPT: When making any decision related to exercise, productivity or simply going out of the house, stand up, walk around and even just step outside your front door. It's always easier to say "No" when you're not moving.

Whenever I feel like skipping the gym, bailing on my night plans or not going to class, I force myself to stand up. Then, I walk out of the bed/living room, and then I walk outside. I don't know whether it's a psychological attitude of "Well, I'm already here, so I might as well" or any other reason, but it's almost like a lightswitch flicks on and I feel so much more inclined to do... pretty much everything. It's just a lot easier to say "I want to do something" when you're outside, or even just on your feet.

I've found this to be a big help in combating the days where I feel I want to be lazy, non-productive or even simply introvertedâ€”all of which never fail to make me feel terrible about myself and make my depression flare up. Perhaps this is conventional wisdom, but it's worked really well for me in fighting my own sloth and depression, and I've heard similar advice from others enough by now, so I figured I'd share. I hope it helps someone.
