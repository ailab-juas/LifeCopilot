LPT: if you know someone who's feeling low, is dealing with a down turn, is feeling depressed or anxious. Do not tell them that they can come talk to you or "PMs are open". Go and actually talk to them!

content:
Most people don't want to be a burden on others, and by saying something that is actually quite noncommittal, you're not really helping them much by asking them to make the first move apart from feeling good about yourself. 
Since a lot of people also say this kind of stuff, it's not easy to figure out if someone actually means what they're saying or not.

If you want someone to open up to you, show them that you mean it and strike a conversation with them. Rather than asking them to take the risk of coming to you themselves, since most would rather choose to keep it in instead!    



Edit: a lot of people have written comments opening up or expressing their situation and/or loneliness, then immediately deleted their comment!   
To those people, I am sorry to hear about that! I've read all of the comments even if I can't physically respond to them! I hope things turn out alright in the end!
