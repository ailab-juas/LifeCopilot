LPT: Making crepes/pancakes? Use a protein shaker bottle. Easy to mix/shake the batter inside, easy to pour onto the frying pan, less to clean!

content:
Learned this during my undergrad of course. For easy crepes in a 750ml protein shake bottle;

Crack 1-2 eggs, fill 40-65% with flour, few pinches of salt, top up with milk (in 2 stages to prevent lumps). Then do what shaker bottle was designed for, imagine you are making a cocktail or something, shake it!

I prefer bottles with a metal whisk inside for this. Pour straight onto the pan through the spout/mouthpiece. At the end of it just pour some water and washing liquid inside, and shake again!
