title:
LPT: you cannot therapy your way out of a bad living situation. If your basic needs aren’t being met there is no amount of therapy that will help your mental health be ok about it. Don’t let people blame you for being “weak” about being depressed, anxious, hopeless about being poor.

This blew up more than I thought. 

I want to add: Therapy can help you identify ways to solve your environmental problems, set boundaries with toxic people ect but if your life is tough it is ok to feel it, toxic positivity is harmful and sometimes no matter how hard you pull on your bootstraps they don’t move.
