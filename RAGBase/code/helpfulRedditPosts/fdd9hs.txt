YSK that if you need to cough or sneeze but don't have a tissue or handkerchief, it is much more hygienic to cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow than your hands. Health &amp; Sciences

content:
When coughing or sneezing, it is always advisable to cover your mouth and nose in order to avoid spraying an aerosol of your potentially hazardous bodily fluids over every nearby surface. You should ideally do this with a tissue or handkerchief if you have one to hand, but if not then it is quite common to cover your mouth and nose with your hands. However, this is quite ineffective as it often leaves gaps, either between your fingers or where your fingers meet your face, through which the aerosol of your bodily fluids can be propelled with great force, and also because it covers your hands with those same bodily fluids, which will then contaminate every surface you touch until you wash your hands (ideally with soap and warm water for about 20 seconds or as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday to You twice).

Accordingly, if you are caught without a tissue or handkerchief and feel the need to sneeze or cough, cover your nose and mouth your elbow. This is far more effective at covering your mouth and nose as you can bury your nose in the inside of your elbow so your upper and lower arm form an effective seal against each side of your face and direct any escaping fluid projection downwards, and also because it keeps your hands clear of contamination.
