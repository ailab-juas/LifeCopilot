title:
YSK activated charcoal interferes with prescription medications

content:
Ysk activated charcoal is on trend and being used in toothpastes, cleanses, foods, cleaning products...I'm sure you've all seen the adds. Activated charcoal is actually very effective because it bonds to alien molecules preventing your body from digesting them. Poison control uses activated charcoal to prevent people from overdosing or digesting toxins.

 The issues is, activated charcoal can't distinguish between alien substances we choose to put in our bodies like prescription medications and more harmful ones. As a result, people are finding activated charcoal interferes with their prescription medication including antibiotics and birth control. If you are taking part in the new trend, please be mindful of how it will effect your medication.

Edit: To clarify, you have to ingest the activated charcoal for it to interfere with medications, face washes and such should not cause this specific issue. I do not know enough about all activated charcoal products to answer peoples specific questions and reccomend some but not others.

Lots of comments arguing there is not enough in toothpaste to interfere with medications.  My doctor warned to stop using it and following so, my birth control stopped being weird (extra periods and whatnot). Regardless, numerous self-identified dentist in the comments have warned activated charcoal toothpaste damages your enamel and causes dental problems. Will specifically reccomend not to use this one.
