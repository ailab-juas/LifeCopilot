LPT: When getting fit, or fitter, I find it a huge help to count descending. Psychologically it is far easier to complete your set approaching 0, rather than giving up at 7/8 out of 10. Two more to get to 0 is easier than two more to get to 10! An easy and simple change that makes a huge difference.

So often when I’m in gyms or exercising anywhere I see and hear people gearing up/psyching up for a set and then...1, 2, 3. Flip that around and  count 10, 9, 8... you’ll find you maintain your form, and more often achieve your goal reps. You can always add more if you hit 0 with more in the tank! In time, progress your reps as normal to 12/15/20. 

I also find it helpful distracting your mind from the pain during the set by working out the fraction/% for checkpoints. For example, for a set of 20, once you hit 15 you think to yourself 1/4 of the way there come on, next checkpoint is 5 more to get to 10 and you’re 1/2 way there. And so on...
This also works with your sets by the way, 3/5 done, only two more to go, think to yourself, of course I can do that.
