YSK: Dead black widow spiders may only be playing dead

Why YSK: Finding this infamous spider dead may garner interest, but it may be only playing dead. Not taking care can result in getting bitten. 

I found one "dead" inside my outdoor cat shelter. It was huge, so first, I left for 5 minutes to get my husband to come see it, then I put my hand next to the "corpse" for a picture. I wanted to throw it in the grass afterwards, but I dropped it in the driveway, which the thing took as an opportunity to run away. I've always heard to watch out for this spider, but was never told it was smart enough to play dead.
