LPT: On crutches? Zip tie a bike water bottle holder to the side of one of your crutches.

content:
Put the zip tie through the height adjustment holes that are not in use. If you buy a solid water bottle cage instead of a wire one you can also use it to place items such as your phone or keys in it. You can put one on either side too if you need.

I'm currently on crutches and this is very helpful and time saving for me.

**EDIT:** They also sell metal spikes that can be attached to the bottom of crutches and lifted up and down for when you're outside and it's icy.
