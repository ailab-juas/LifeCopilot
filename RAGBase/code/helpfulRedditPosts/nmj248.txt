LPT: Get a copy of everything you sign. Everything. You'd be surprised the number of businesses that don't plan to give you a copy or don't want to.

content:
Example is one time I signed a contract with a home builder that acknowledged all of the design options and specifications of my home were correct. I asked for a copy. The project manager said he didn't know if they were allowed to provide it since, if they made a mistake, it would be recorded. I told them that I get a copy of anything I sign. Why would one party only have the contract? I went to the agent and eventually got a copy. It's something they owed me. It's not a courtesy.

Edit: As many people have noted, part of this LPT should also be to READ what you sign before signing it.

Edit: Some people have commented and said things like I should have walked away at this point. Building a new home, however, involves multiple contracts, the first of which involves getting things started by reserving land, choosing a model (if not using a custom builder), etc., and all of that requires a large, non-refundable deposit. By the time we got to the specifications and design contract, we were already 10s of thousands into it. There is no walking away at that point without a substantial financial loss.
