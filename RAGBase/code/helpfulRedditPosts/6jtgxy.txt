YSK: Always add your spouses name to your reservation at hotels, even if they have the same last name.

ALWAYS add your spouses name to your reservation at hotels. A lot of hotels have very specific rules about checking into hotels (for your safety)
Spousal abuse is very common, and just because you're married and have the same name doesn't mean they are allowed to be in your room. It's much easier and less complicated to go online, or call and add a name, then to wait for someone to verify they are allowed in the room.

I can't tell you how many times someone has had a fit because I couldn't check them into a room under their spouses name.
