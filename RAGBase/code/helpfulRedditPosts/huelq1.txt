YSK that seeking help is not, and will never be, a sign of weakness.

content:
Sometimes the weight of things is heavier than we want to admit and we carry it for too long. Make sure you’re taking care of your mental health. Sometimes venting to friends, family, or people online can help, but sometimes the help of professionals is what we need. Please don’t feel shameful in reaching out, however you go about it.

Your life is important and it matters more than words could ever explain. Know that you’re loved and you’ll always have support and someone who will listen. Do what you have to do to be the best, healthiest, and happiest you.
