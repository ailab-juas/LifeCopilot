title:
LPT: When helping a friend in need, be specific about things you could do for them, rather than making a broad general offer.

content:

- I can pick up your prescription during lunch today. Let me know. 
- Making lasagna on Thursday, can I bring some over for you?
- Saturday afternoon for Netflix? I’ll come over with snacks...don’t clean!

Specific things work so much better for someone going through a hard time than saying “anything you need, just tell me.” Even if you really mean it!
