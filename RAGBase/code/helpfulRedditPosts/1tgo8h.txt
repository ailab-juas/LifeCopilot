LPT: Don't exit school for the workforce until you've take a personal finance class

content:
I can't tell you how many people I know (my family members included) who have screwed up their lives by not knowing the basics of personal finance.  The concepts taught in a personal finance class can save you a ton of hardship in the long run and set you up to enjoy retirement one day instead of stressing about it.

Most folks think they know how to handle money, and to *some* extent, that's always true.  But money is a touchy subject for public conversation, so it's pretty rare for folks to have stumbled across all the important personal finance concepts by the time they're out on their own with a good income.  There are just *too* many things you need to understand in the money world nowadays -- revolving/installment credit, interest, insurance, retirement vs. non-retirement investment vehicles, stocks/bonds/ETFs/mutual funds, estate planning and associated laws, the list goes on.  

I wish our school systems would make this a requirement, but we haven't gotten there yet.  So...please.  If you're graduating in May, take a personal finance class this spring.  Take it for audit or for credit only if you must.  I have a degree in engineering and I stumbled into a class in my senior year because I needed an extra elective.  It was the most useful class I've ever taken, *much* more useful than my engineering classes.  I hope those of you that choose to take this advice will agree.  If you're out of school and want to pursue this, there are other options -- perhaps subscribe to a personal finance magazine or maybe check the free online course offerings out there (there are lots of good free classes nowadays on coursera.org or edx.org or others).

edit: d'oh, just realized I left the "n" off taken when I was rewording the title.  Sigh.

edit 2: on the recommendation of some I checked out the **Khan Academy** and their curriculum looks very solid.  So I am recommending their class in [Finance and Capital Markets](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance).  It's missing some insurance topics I'd recommend, and doesn't go into estate planning, but overall is a win, especially for the low, low price of free.
