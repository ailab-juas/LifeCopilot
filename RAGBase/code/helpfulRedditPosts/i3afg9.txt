A child that says hello to you is learning social skills. A smile or wave can mean a lot to someone learning to interact with the world.  I sometimes see my daughter muster the courage to say hello to a stranger and feel sad when she looks at me confused after she's ignored.  A small acknowledgment is a quick and easy way to put some positive energy into the world.
