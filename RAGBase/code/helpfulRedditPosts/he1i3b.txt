LPT: In a debate if you don’t have a response, it is ok to say ‘I don’t know’, it does not make you look weak or intellectually inferior; only a fool thinks they have the answer to every question.

If you’re involved in a debate, and the subject matter is complex. It is ok to say ‘I don’t know’, it does not make you weak or intellectually inferior. 

I feel with everything going on in the world, it is important to understand that only a fool thinks they know everything and it is the wise man or women that knows the limits of their knowledge.

To be a true subject matter expert in any field takes decades of study.
