YSK: Most car bluetooth phones are extremely loud and hearable to the outside even if the windows are up.

Why YSK: Because everyone outside of the car, walking by or even standing outside can hear everything you're saying regardless of if the windows are up.

Definitely don't discuss banking or any other confidential subjects or information on a bluetooth car phone because it is easy for someone outside the car to overhear and possibly steal the information.
