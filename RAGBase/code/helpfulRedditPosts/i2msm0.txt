LPT: When you've offended a child, even if you're "only teasing", apologize to them.

content:
There's a little boy I've seen at three different family gatherings. He doesn't remember me every time I see him but the first two encounters were fairly pleasant and today, when I went to his parents wedding, I teased him a little about his outfit. We were all supposed to carry swords and a lot of people had medieval style costumes. He had "armor" and his hair was done in a style that made think of Bran from Game of Thrones.   


He told me to "stop," because even though I had playful intentions, he thought I was being mean.   


Even though he's seven and he's likely to forget the whole encounter, I still made sure to apologize to him and to explain that sometimes I don't always know when to joke around with someone. He said, "okay," we fist bumped and we parted as friends.
