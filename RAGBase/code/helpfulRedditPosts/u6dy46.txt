LPT: The moment you are taken into the police office for questioning, do not say anything to the police other than "Am I being detained or free to go?", if they keep you then say "I want to speak to an attorney and will invoke my right to remain silent from here on."

content:
Police are required by law to stop the interrogation the moment you say you want to speak to a lawyer or you invoke your to remain silent. Some may continue to question you or make you feel guilty for not talking to them, but continue to repeat "I want to speak to my lawyer, and I will invoke my right to remain silent."   

Understand that at this point they will try to fish any information out of you to incriminate you for a crime, regardless of how innocent you are and will continue to lie or press you for any information.  Anything you say or do will be used against you in court, including the video of you sitting there alone in the room to analyze your behavior,  your fingerprints from the room temperature water bottle they give you, and/or the food they provide to you.     

They are not your friends despite how they may tell you that they want to help you prove your innocence.
