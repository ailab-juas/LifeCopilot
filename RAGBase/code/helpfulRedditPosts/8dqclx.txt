YSK Planet Fitness has a 3 day refund policy that they DO NOT tell you about before or after signing.

I recently signed a 12 month commitment with Planet Fitness and did not (silly i know) visit the gym before hand. Long story short i was disappointed by the lack of barbells for deadlifts/benchpress/etc. I talked to the front desk, they told me i could cancel after paying the $60 fee. I called and talked to two different managers, same thing. I looked through my membership agreement and surprise surprise they have a clause (section 9, paragraph 1 for Texas memberships) that allows canceling within 3 business days without paying the fee! 

PS: the manager i talked too in person told me, to my face, i couldnâ€™t cancel without the fee so i slapped down my agreement with the section highlighted and within 1 minute i was walking out with a canceled contract.

EDIT: I should add that i got an email confirming my cancellation and the reason they had listed was "lunk", seems like an unprofessional way to say "he cancelled according to our own agreement"?

EDIT 2: I have been stewing all day about this and reading all your complaints with sleazy gyms decided to submit a consumer protection complaint with the state attorney, hopefully they get a talking to about lying to customers about their own policies.
