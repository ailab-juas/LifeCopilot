LPT: Always keep a 24h go bag in your car

content:
Make sure you can comfortably stay away from home for 24h in case anything happens or you don't have time to stop and get your stuff.

I keep a set of gym clothes, a swimsuit, a set of regular clothes, shoes, a towel, deodorant, wipes, a battery pack and some cash in mine. It has saved my ass multiple times.

Edit: for everyone asking about the swimsuit, it's so that I can decide to go swimming after class in a dam nearby. And for skipping class a and going to the beach.
