LPT: Sometimes in life its better to identify a bad investement, swallow your pride, admit its just not working and cut your losses. This stands for business and relationship choices, in the long term you will be better off.

content:
I have made investments in the past in business's and other things that early on I have identifies may not be as good as I first thought. I have also been in relationships that I have known are not healthy or going anywhere however I have stayed in that relationship hoping it gets better.

The truth of the matter is if I had swallowed my pride, not waited for a change in luck or completely just denied what is front of my eyes then I would be better off. You can put it behind you, get over it and then start to move on faster, you have not wasted long periods of time, energy and less money than you would do sticking to it.
