LPT: Sleep with your car keys close by. If you ever hear anyone trying to break into the house or your car, quickly trigger the cars alarm.

content:
All that extra noise will be a huge deterrent. Even if it doesn't totally stop the intruder it will give them pause, and give you time to make your next move.

**EDIT** because lots of ppl are saying I just made this up. I decided to post this because I successfully did this for the second time 2 nights ago when someone was trying to pry my front door in (previous time was like 6 years ago). 

As soon as I heard them trying to enter, I set off my cars alarm and they took off. 

Will this trick deter every criminal? Of course not. Is this trick accessible for everyone? Of course not. Is it dependant on having a certain key fob and being able to park your car close by? Of course it is 

I was just trying to post something that has helped me twice now, and I thought might help keep other people safe. 

If anything, it might just give you some extra time to grab a weapon, make some more noise, or get to safety.
