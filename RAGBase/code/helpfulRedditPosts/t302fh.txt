LPT: Stop Watching "FaSt FoOd HaCkS", If You Want Something Really Specific For Your Order Just Ask

content:
I see all the time people ranting about how they know the best tricks and tips for fresh food and secret menu items. If you want something fresh or custom, just ask man it isn't that deep. Most of the time it's some teenager (like me) taking the order or making the food so it's not like we care. Do you want extra ice cream on your cone? Just ask we'll do it. Do you want fresh fries? Sure. The only people who may give you grief are managers, but due to customer service policies, they can't do much.  

And a side note, stop worrying about us judging you for what you order. The fact that you came here is an inconvenience because we actually have to do something, so we don't care if you want tartar sauce with your breakfast sandwich.

And I know this is barely a LPT, but you can use this tip at any fast food place to get whatever you want.

Edit; Wow this post blew up, thanks for the awards and comments it’s been great replying to them. I work at McDonalds btw, so I’ll answer any questions if you have any.
