LPT: When meeting a person for the first time, ask them about "what they like to do", rather than asking them about "what they do".

content:
You meet someone for the first time and ask them, "What do you do?".  They respond with a scripted answer of their job tittle and duties and maybe some history of their employer or the field they work in.  They ask you the same question and you take your turn mindlessly telling them about your mundane job.  The conversation peters out because you can both sense no one is in the mood to talk about work. 

But what if you had asked this person, "What do you like to do?".   The response from this question will be drastically different.  The person will become excited and talkative while they are sharing what they do for fun or where they like to travel.  Who knows, you may share an interest or hobby that would have remained buried if you had never asked the question.

I know that many conversations will naturally progress from talking about work or school to things like hobbies and passions.  However, first impressions are important and time is of the essence.  When someone is walking away from a conversation with me, I want them to remember me as the guy who is excited and passionate not they guy who is boring and overworked.

TL:DR, Have better conversations when meeting new people by asking them about they like to do and not what they do.
