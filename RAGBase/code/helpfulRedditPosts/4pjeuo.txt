LPT: When asking someone to speak in another language, don't ask them to just "say something," ask them "tell me about your day."

content:
It's exciting to hear a different language, but too many people (*cough* Americans *cough) just say "say something in xxxxxx :)."

Asking "tell me about you day in xxxxxx" gives them a topic to talk about, and you might be able to hear similar words.
