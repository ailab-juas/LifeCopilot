LPT: Beware someone, claiming that they work for an alarm company, going house to house asking if you have an alarm system. This person could simply be looking for the perfect house to rob. Always answer yes, that you already have an alarm system.

Had this happen to me once. I thought it was odd, that after answering yes, that I do have an alarm system, the man continued on by asking, "Do you have those little things in the inside of your windows and doors? Uh, yes. Sometimes the person could be trying to figure out if your house is easy to enter.
