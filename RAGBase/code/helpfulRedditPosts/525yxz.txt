LPT: Groups of friends where one couple now has a kid, continue to invite them to events/gatherings, even if they continuously are unable to attend.

content:
 We are (were?) friends with a large group that frequently has events, outings or gatherings.  We were the first to have a child in the group and have been struggling to figure out a healthy home/life balance. Things were hard with work and a kid so we declined a lot of invites. 

After a year, we've started to get in our groove and do things more but the invites have nearly stopped. We definitely feel like outcasts sometimes as a result of this.
