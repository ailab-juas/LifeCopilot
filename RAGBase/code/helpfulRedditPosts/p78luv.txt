LPT: When you’re in an interview, a good interviewer will always end with the question….Do you have any questions for me? You should already have a question ready…

content:

My go to question is this.

&gt;Yeah, how did you get your job? 

This is great question because you don’t have to really answer anything from there, how would you know anything about this subject? And it’s highly unlikely that anyone else has asked the interviewer specially about themselves. And in the interview process the best thing is to stand out, and are you going to remember the person that didn’t ask anything or the person that asked about yourself? 

And they usually have some great story, even if long winded…mostly they are… omg, I haven’t thought about it, it such-a strange  thing really, I was here, then there and something happened and now I’m HR director or whatever. 

From there when they end you can either continue up with follow up or, say something like well it was great meeting with you Mr./Ms. Blank, and it’s u/adrewmc if you forgot.

Edit: a lot of comments are calling this silly, or pointless. But I feel a lot of these people are talking about jobs that require, a lot of experience and skill.

So I say, this is back pocket question. If you have really pointed question about the job ask those instead, that should be obvious.

It’s Something you can walk into any interview and go…well I know I have a good way to end this.
