LPT: We take photos of things that we don't see everyday. Make sure you remember to take pictures of people you're going to miss when they're gone.

After losing my father I realized I haven't take many photos of him. I hung out with him basically every day which is why I had no photos. I had tons of photos containing things we built together, but like 10 of him/us. Luckily, I have siblings that did much better than me in this regard. Take photos of your loved one often and make sure you are in some of those pictures too!
