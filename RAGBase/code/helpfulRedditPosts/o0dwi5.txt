title:
YSK that if you’re out with people and don’t want to drink for any reason; having a non-alcoholic drink (anything really) in your hand can help you feel at ease and signal others you don’t need a drink.

content:
Why YSK: Our society expects people to drink, and there are hundreds of reasons people don’t. A lot of people simply get very anxious of the possibility they can called out or asked why they don’t drink. I know I did and still do today.   

This tip has helped me through my 15 years being sober and hope this tip helps you too.   

Original tip was removed from LPT as “advice”. I’ve appealed and hope this tip gets back up.


Edit:  Holy crap!  Thank you all for your comments and support of each other!  

For those saying just to “say no”, obviously this is what we can do, unfortunately many people do not just say “okay cool man”. Moreover, it’s the internal struggle that often can be worse than the crap from other people.
