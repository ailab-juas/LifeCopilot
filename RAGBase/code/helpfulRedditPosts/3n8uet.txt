LPT: In an active shooter situation, police trainers now recommend that civilians fight back

content:
I am a teacher at a high school, and they gave us a really amazing training this year from the state police about active shooter situations.

They told us to avoid or escape the situation if at all possible, and they taught us how to break windows and bar the doors. But they also taught us how to defend, how to grab the gun and push it to the ground and hold on to it so it will jam when they try to fire it. They also told us to yell, scream, and throw things and not to get under furniture and just wait, because it won't protect you. They told us that they had trained police officers who would try to fire a (paintball) gun at a group who was throwing tennis balls at them. Even the trained police officer couldn't fire anywhere but the ground with all the objects flying at them. 

It was very eye-opening. Of course everyone has to make their own decision on how best to survive in the moment, but they repeatedly told us that, if the gunman is in the room with you, you'll have better chances if you fight back rather than "wait to die" as they called it.

There are news stories coming out about a man, Chris Mintz, who charged the attacker in Oregon. He was shot several times, but survived and probably saved many. Also, the state police told us that during the Virginia Tech shooting, a man stood up to the shooter in one of the rooms and the shooter left that room temporarily. They also showed us  videos where people had the opportunity to defend themselves, but did not.

Maybe if people start fighting back, these shooters will be less likely to commit these horrible acts.
