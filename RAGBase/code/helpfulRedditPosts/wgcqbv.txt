LPT: buy only one brand and color of short socks so you don’t have to pair them ever again

content:
I got this idea bc I’m tired of me and my bf constantly loosing short black socks. So the idea was to only buy one specific brand of black short socks and have them all in some drawer. Now we don’t have to bother if we have the right pair bc all the socks are the same (works even better if you and your partner have the same size of feet)

Edit: omg I wasn’t expecting this post to blow up, thank you guys!
