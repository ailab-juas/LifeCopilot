LPT: December is a tough month for those struggling with depression. A great way to fight it is by volunteering and volunteering is very simple.

content:
It's a win-win situation.  In my personal experience my own problems seem to sort themselves out when I start to help other people with theirs.  Get in the holiday spirit and volunteer!

A very simple example would be a service like meals on wheels, it can be as easy as picking up food and dropping it off to someone that needs it.  If you don't have a car they also need help prepping food.  Their info is readily available online.

Animal shelters always need volunteers to walk and wash dogs amongst other things.  Be careful with this one, you will be tempted to adopt!

Perhaps you are skilled in a trade.  Find a lucky individual to offer your services to for free.

There are endless ways.  Make cookies for your work.  Shovel your neighbors driveway.  Watch your friends kids for free.

Things to expect for 1st timers:

It's work!  It won't necessarily be fun.  You will need to sacrifice to make it happen, whether that's time, money, both, or simply canceling/skipping out on something else.  You WILL feel good about it and if you are someone that is struggling with depression it can help you realize you are a good person that deserves to feel good about yourself!

Feel free to share positive volunteering stories, without advertising of course.
