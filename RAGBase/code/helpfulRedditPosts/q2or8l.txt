LPT If your SO is complaining to you about work don’t offer advice to fix the solution, just listen to the problem and make them feel heard.

content:
I’ve had this happen a couple times where my SO has comes to me to vent about how work is making her angry. 99% of the time when I offer solutions or try to help her fix the problem it turns into an argument and she gets more flustered. When I just listen and validate what she is saying and her feelings, it often makes her calm down and feel better. I recommend trying this with your SO when situations like this arise. Sometimes people just want to vent and have you understand the problem, not fix it for them.

Edit*** I want to flag that all relationships are unique and sometimes advice is required, this post is really meant to be the first step on listening and validating, then you can ask if they want to be heard or want advice. 

Also the title should say “don’t always” not “don’t” all relationships and situations are unique to the people involved.
