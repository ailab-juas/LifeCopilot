LPT: The goal of conversation should be to make it enjoyable for the person you are talking to

content:
I'm always amazed how many people simply don't ask questions about others and just continue talking about themselves unless they are stopped.

We all like the feeling of the endorphin rush we get from talking about our passions and interests, but after a certain amount of time, if you never ask me how I'm doing or what I've been up to, talking with you just becomes an effort. It's not a conversation anymore, it's a duty to listen with no hope of reciprocation.

What makes a conversation enjoyable is when someone tells you a story or something from their life, not because they just want to hear themselves talk, but because they want to hear your opinion on what they've said and give you the chance to respond, or maybe share a similar story of your own.

A conversation should be entertaining. When you stimulate someone's interest, you need to pause and give them the chance to express their feelings about what you just said, that's the best part! Seeing how your words impacted the other person! If you just keep talking, the other person's interest will dip off again, and eventually diminish entirely when it becomes clear you have no interest in actually hearing anyone's thoughts but your own.

This is a universal truth, and one everybody should be aware of to make conversations more enjoyable.
