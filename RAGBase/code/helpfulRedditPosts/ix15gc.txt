LPT: Ambulance personnel don't care if you've done illegal drugs. They need to know what you've taken to stop you dying, not to rat you out to the police. You have patient clinician confidentiality.

This is a strange belief we get alot. It's lead to funny incidents of:

"I swear he's never taken anything"

"So that needle in his arm..."

"... It was just once!"

We don't care. Tell us immediately what you've taken. It's important so we don't accidentally kill you with medication. This includes Viagra which if we don't know you've taken it has a strong risk of killing you if we give another vasodilating medication.

Edit:

I write this as a UK worker. As many have pointed out sadly this is not necessarily the case in countries across the world. 

That being said. I still do believe it vital that you state drugs you have taken so a health care worker can support you properly.
