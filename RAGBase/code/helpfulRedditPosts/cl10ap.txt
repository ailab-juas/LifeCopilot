LPT: If any relationship seems too good to be true at first and then suddenly becomes inexplicably difficult / up and down, be very careful! This could be the start of an emotionally abusive relationship.

content:
I wish someone told me this prior to my last relationship. Honestly, I just didn't know how manipulative people can be!

Dark personality types seem perfect at first because they are mirroring what you want to hear.  Eventually, these relationships progress into an abusive and addictive cycle, which can leave you feeling hopeless and depressed and cause issues in all aspects of your life!

Edit: grammar clean up
