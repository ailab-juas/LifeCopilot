YSK - If you know someone that is trying to start their own business or be an entrepreneur then you should help them sooner rather than later. They will most likely fail if you wait to see if they “make it.” They need help in the short term in order to continue in the long term.

Adding onto the post.... If you do want to support as a friend or family member then you should pay market price and not expect a discount. Business owners sacrifice a lot to be able to serve you and it’s a disservice to them to expect a discount. It only harms their business by trying to take advantage of them.

Support for a business can be shown in multiple ways.

Source: I have tried starting multiple businesses and it’s easier to have a foundation of support when you begin. Other people have these same difficulties with business start ups. People like me just want a chance to have a business on their own.

Edit: no one is obligated to support, however, it does help! Support doesn’t always have to be financial.

MLM is no bueno.
