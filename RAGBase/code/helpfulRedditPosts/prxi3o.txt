LPT: Hide fake treasure in your kids sandbox or at the playground for hours of fun!

Burried some fake treasure in the kids sandbox about 4 months ago. They found it this weekend and have been out there for hours looking for more. Nothing makes kids happy like unexpectedly "discovering" things. Have fun with the kids!
