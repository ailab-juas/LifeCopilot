To minimize your risk you should use any gift card balances that you have remaining, and please avoid purchasing new gift cards until Walmart takes action to protect their customers.

Another option is to consolidate any current balances to a new card that has never been on display. Officially they no longer allow gift card consolidation, but my local store had no problem doing this for me.
