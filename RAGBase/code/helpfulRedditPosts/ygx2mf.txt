YSK that dog toys are meant to be destroyed and there will never be an indestructible toy

Why YSK

Dogs like to destroy things. They like to chew and tear and rip and dig at things. It's what they do. Especially prey driven dogs. You giving them things that are specifically theirs is how they manage those base desires without ruining YOUR things. You will likely be buying toys for your dog for their whole life. So expect that. Toys to dogs are not like toys to children. You will probably find yourself buying the same dog toy over and over. They get ripped up. They get dirty. They fulfill their purpose.

There are many different types of toys out there. Standard plush type toys are likely to survive the least amount of time. That much is obvious. But there are other types that will last much longer even with excessive or rough use. It all depending on how your dog plays and they toys they like.


There will never ever ever be an indestructible toy. Not ever. The dog toy industry would never make it because then you wouldn't buy more toys. It's just not a thing and it never will be. BUT there are some toys that are stronger than others (more info in comments) 

ALWAYS SUPERVISE YOUR DOGS PLAY ESPECIALLY WITH NEW TOYS
