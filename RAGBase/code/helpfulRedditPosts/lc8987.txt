LPT: Don’t throw away a blanket that’s just a bit worn out or stained. Instead, donate it to your local animal shelter. For many homeless pets, a soft place to sleep is their greatest solace.

I can’t believe this post has gotten so much attention. Thank you all so much! This is surreal and also gratifying. It makes me happy to know that this tip is getting out there, along with several others that I’ve seen mentioned in the comments. 

A lot of you have brought up homeless people, and I agree that their lives matter too. The main reasons I didn’t mention them in the post title are because this is about animals, and also about blankets that most people would consider unappealing or even unusable. If your unwanted blanket is still in decent condition, then by all means donate it to a homeless person or shelter.

Some of you have mentioned the fact that many animal shelters have an overload of donations or for a number of other reasons aren’t accepting them. So yes, it’s always a good idea to call ahead. 

Veterinary clinics are a good place to donate to as well, and as mentioned, towels and sheets are also a good thing to keep in mind.

One more thing I’d like to say: I am so humbled by your generosity with awards for this post, but I implore you to give your money away elsewhere. Please donate it to homeless or animal shelters or to other reputable charities. They need it more than I do.
