YSK that being dehydrated drops your blood pressure which can make you feel depressed. This can also cause your heart to beat harder, causing anxiety.

Why YSK: if you are already prone to depression or anxiety, dehydration makes it feel much worse, and it's so easy to do by accident. Because you don't have enough volume of blood, its harder for your body to maintain blood flow. This causes your body to mimic the symptoms of depression (fatigue, brain fog, dizziness), which can cause you to think the depressed thoughts, causing your brain to make depression chemicals. When that makes you feel shitty enough, your heart will try to fix it by beating harder, raising your blood pressure, mimicking anxiety. Additionally, it becomes harder for your blood to carry oxygen, making you breathe harder, which for me is the one that causes me to panic.

This isn't a WoW tHaNkS iM cUrEd, but for me personally makes a huge difference. For hours today my anxiety was unmanageably high for no particular reason. After an almost-breakdown I chugged 20oz of water, took a few deep breaths, and 20 minutes later felt so much better it spawned me to write this.

EDIT: lots of people being skeptical because I linked a "blog" (an anxiety-focused charity), so here's your scholarly article, [Effects of Dehydration and Rehydration on Cognitive Performance and Mood among Male College Students in Cangzhou, China: A Self-Controlled Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603652/#:~:text=As%20a%20conclusion%2C%20dehydration%20had,memory%2C%20attention%2C%20and%20reaction.).

Sorry for using such unscientific terms as "shitty" and "depression chemicals" on reddit of all places. Also can someone point out where I say depression isn't real and people just need to drink water? it's not like I'm telling people to replace their meds with hydration jeez louise ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
