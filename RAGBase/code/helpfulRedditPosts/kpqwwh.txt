YSK there's a difference between cleaning out a "dryer lint filter/screen" and cleaning out "the inside of a dryer trap."

content:
Why YSK: a lot of people regularly clean their lint screens/filters but don't actually clean out the lint trap itself, which can lead to bad dryer performance and even risk a fire.

A lot of posts on Reddit recently have shown "lint traps" being cleaned out. Most of these videos/gifs are actually just the **lint screens/filters** or are outside the dryer itself. Don't think mistake cleaning out the filter for being the same thing as cleaning out the **inside of the trap** itself.

Here's a few photos that walk you through what the difference is: https://imgur.com/a/aANbamo
