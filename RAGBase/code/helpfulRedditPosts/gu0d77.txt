YSK when faced with an emergency or stressful situation the fist thing you should do is take a deep breath in and let it out slowly.

content:
Huge caveat to this! If you are in a life threatening emergency do whatever possible to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you. Do not endanger yourself by doing nothing!

Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly stimulates the vagus nerve which can help to suppress some of the initial fight or flight reflexes that can cause inappropriate reactions or cause panic. 

The best thing you can do in an emergency is remain calm, assess, and then react. Reacting on fight or flight instincts can cloud your judgment which could cause you to make the wrong decision or react in an inappropriate manner.
