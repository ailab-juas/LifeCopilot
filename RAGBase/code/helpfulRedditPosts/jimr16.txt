title:
LPT: If you offer someone an alcoholic drink and they say no, immediately tell them what non-alcoholic drinks you have. With no judgment. They don't owe you any explanation of recovery, medical contraindications, or whether or not they just don't feel like it that day.

content:
Recovering alcoholics struggle because a lot of people don't understand that 'just one' can't be done. Also, nobody should owe you their medical history just because you think not drinking with you is 'uncool'. 

If the person was just objecting to the TYPE of alcohol you offered, believe me, they'll ask what else you have on hand. Or you can just say, 'We have other drinks, and these are the non-alcoholic drinks I have: blah blah blah."
