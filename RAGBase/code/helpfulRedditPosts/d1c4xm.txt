title:
YSK: Ingredients on a food label are listed in order of quantity from high to low.

content:
This is helpful when you are looking for an item with a high or low concentration of a particular ingredient in products that have multiple ingredients, like cereal, juice, sauce, pesto, salsa, soup, protein powder, and even pet food.

It's also helpful for gauging the concentration of an active ingredient in non-food items like skin care products, tooth paste, deodorant, and soap.

Note - the first ingredient listed isn't necessarily the majority ingredient, its the highest ranking in terms of quantity.
