LPT: When someone who is hard of hearing says "what?" make sure to make eye contact before you repeat yourself.

I'm a younger guy who is hard of hearing and it drives me nuts when I miss something that is said and people just repeat themselves immediately, at the same volume &amp;  speed,  and speaking in the same direction as they did when I missed it. Making sure you have eye contact,  then repeating yourself will help slow you down, direct the sound, and even allows the person to do some basic lip reading. Saves you both a lot of frustration.
