YSK Reddit only allows you to view the last 1000 posts that you've saved.

I've been using reddit over 7yrs and I only learned this today so I imagine there's many of you out there that also don't know. In that 7yrs I've used the convinient "save" button on thousands and thousands of posts.

In the back of my mind I always assumed I'd export those posts at some point and categorise them. However I learned today that you can only see the last 1000 posts that you've saved - which for me might only be a couple weeks/months worth. Truly devastating.

If anyone knows of a solution I'd be forever in your debt.
