LPT: Just because someone is recovering, even drastically, from suicidal depression doesn’t mean they are safe from suicide. Keep your guard up still

content:
You still have to pay extra caution with them with access to guns, emotional care, etc. just as if they are still in their depressive state.

My brother was drastically improving his depression and was actually planning his future as well. It literally didn’t look like he was depressed at all because of the complete 180 he has done, but he committed suicide a few months later. I don’t want anybody to feel like shit because they lowered their guard.

[Here is a study on this topic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3712978/). It says that recent studies don’t indicate that they are *more* likely to commit suicide during recovery (because it is taught that this is true. I’m not sure of this validity), but nevertheless it is still a danger to be aware of.

Another similar thing to look for is sudden changes in emotion, like suddenly being very happy
