LPT: If you ever check-in to a hotel in an area you don't know, always grab the business card of the hotel.

content:
I went on vacation to Germany and my friend gave me the business card of our hotel and said "in case you need it."  I took it but was like i'll never need it.

Then I got hammered drunk with all our friends and didn't know how to get to the hotel. Our flight was in 3 hours, but our shuttle was in 45 min. I asked the taxi driver if he knew the hotel we were at then he said "which one."  Then I remembered the business card, i pulled it out and gave it to the driver.  He said "OK." 5 minutes later i was back at the hotel.
