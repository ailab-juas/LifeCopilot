YSK That for t-mobile users there is a scam currently going on where you are called for a survey offering $20 and they ask for information to steal your identity

This happened to me yesterday and I was not sure where to post this but I want everyone to know about this situation. I know this is a scam after confirming with t-mobile representatives. These scammers have hacked t-mobile and use official sounding t-mobile automated systems. Also when you call the scammers back they can actually put you on queue with real t-mobile representatives. Most of us know to be careful with our SSN but please tell anyone you know especially you're parents.
