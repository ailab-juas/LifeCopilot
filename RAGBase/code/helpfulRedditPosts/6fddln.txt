LPT: When a loved one is in the hospital, consider something more functional than flowers as a gift.

content:
If a loved one is the hospital for more than a 24 hour stay, consider different gift routes than flowers. Flowers tend to die quickly, and can pose an infection risk so they tend to be put in the corner of the room often. A great example is a water bottle cooler (e.g., Yeti or off brand equivalent) which does wonders to keep fresh ice water at hand--something a person who can't do everything on their own will really appreciate. This might sound expensive, but there are relatively cheap options AND hospital flowers/balloons are super expensive. Another idea would be a very soft blanket! Advice coming from a nurse as well as a patient hospitalized.
