LPT: Never send an email when you're in a heightened emotional state, even if you're extremely happy. Wait until you're feeling neutral, then send it.

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes, pals! I did want to clarify the part about "never" sending an email when you're extremely happy. 

If you're responding to an email about someone's amazing news about winning the lottery/buying a house/getting engaged etc. it probably makes sense to write them back with a message full of passion and emotion. I was thinking more in professional setting or in situations involving money or some kind of transaction. Sometimes when we're really happy, we agree to do things we wouldn't normally do and we get taken advantage of.

I feel most people already know it's a bad idea to send an email when you're super pissed about something, and that you should wait until you calm down. But fewer people (including myself, until recently) don't realize it might be a good idea to wait until you've calmed down from being in an extremely joyous/excited state before sending that email.
