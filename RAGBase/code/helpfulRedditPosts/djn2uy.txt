LPT: Instead of paying for every streaming service at the same time, alternate services every few months.

Not only will it be much cheaper, you probably binge watch shows on a single service at a time and you'll barely notice a difference. When you get bored with the current service (say HBO Now) or a new season is out on say Netflix, that's when you should cancel and switch.
