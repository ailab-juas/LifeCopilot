YSK how to write a resume as a recent college graduate with no job experience...

content:
A lot of job seekers don't include their "non-jobs" (i.e. non-paid activities) on their resume. You can take advantage of this with some creative language, and present these non-jobs in a way that shows their relevance to the job you're applying for.

Remember: potential employers don't care about what you want, they care about what you can do for them. 

In the "Experience" part of your resume, include things like past volunteer work, extra-curricular activities and clubs that you're passionately involved in, and things of that nature - and describe your role as if it were a "real job". 

So, for example, don't just write "volunteered for summer, teaching children" - speak to your duties. You might want to instead write "experience managing large groups of people, developed engaging training materials to help foster expertise".

There are more examples [here](https://www.vmsolu.com/resume-writing-tips-for-recent-college-graduates/) (where I got the idea from) but this is the **tl;dr** version. Hope it helps.
