LPT: If you're searching for a paper but getting paywalled, search the title on Google Scholar. Under the title, click "All x versions" and look for a link prefaced with "[PDF]". This will directly bring up a PDF of the article rather than a link to a host site.

This is also a good way to skip a few clicks even if the article isn't paywalled, especially if you're in a research time crunch.
