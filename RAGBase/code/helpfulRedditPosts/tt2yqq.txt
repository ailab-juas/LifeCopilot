LPT: As we head into April 1st, please remember: A lie or deliberate misinformation is not an April fool's joke. Especially if it manipulates somebody's emotions.

content:
Don't ask people on fake dates.

Don't tell them a family member died.

Don't make jokes about covid.

Don't pretend to fire somebody.

April fools jokes should be practical and, ideally, harmless or briefly shocking at worst.

Don't make somebody feel like shit so you can get a laugh.
