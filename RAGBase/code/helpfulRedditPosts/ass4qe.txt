LPT: If your flight gets cancelled while you are at the airport, don't approach the ticket agent, but call the 1800 number to re-book your flight.

content:
Everyone on the flight will be looking to get on the next best option and a lot of them will be annoyed or upset, adding stress to you, those around them and the agents. Your best move is to sit down and call the 1800 number of your airline where a person will be able to re-book you before the red-faced screamers ahead of you in line. 
As an add-on, always be polite to your ticket agent, they might have the power to make your travel a lot more pleasant, and even if they don't they do not have control over your flight getting cancelled, so taking your frustration out on them is not solving anything.
