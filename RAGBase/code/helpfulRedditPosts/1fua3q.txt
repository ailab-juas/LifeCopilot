(1 - 1:21) Reciprocity - favors and giving encourages favors and giving in return  
(2 - 3:07) Scarcity - the more unique and the more valuable the more persuasive  
(3 - 4:11) Authority - something in a more formal or professional or official form is more influential  
(4 - 6:05) Consistency - people like to stay true to their choices?  
(5 - 7:42) Liking - people who like each other are easier to persuade  
(6 - 9:06) Consensus - majority knows better and peer pressure  

The video is based on research by [Dr. Robert Cialdini, Regent Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini)

Edit: scientifically / statistically *supported.* Nothing in science is ever proven
