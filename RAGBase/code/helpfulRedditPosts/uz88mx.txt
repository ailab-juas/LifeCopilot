LPT: friends on a budget may not be hanging out because they can't afford it

content:
Sometimes it could be gas or the cost of eating out or parking..there's so many things that people on a budget watch. 
Even going to do something free but open ended could result in them being in a social situation where they may feel pressured to spend money they can't afford and will opt out with an excuse.


* be clear of all the activities planned
* offer to pick them up
* don't be vague if you're going to treat them to lunch or an activity, make it clear you'll be paying
*never bring this up with them. Unfortunately there's stigma and some shame around lack of money, so if your friends start spending more time with you after employing these techniques, just silently continue to be a good bud.
