title:
YSK about the app TraffickCam, it crowd sources photos of hotel rooms to aid the FBI in stopping sex trafficking.

content:
It takes a couple of seconds and could potentially save a child's life.
TraffickCam collects photos users submit of hotel rooms that are then shared with the FBI and compared to photos of child porn. If enough people can contribute, we might be able to make some small dent in this horrible activity.
I've shared the link with my favorite true crime podcasts, I think we should all try and spread the word!
