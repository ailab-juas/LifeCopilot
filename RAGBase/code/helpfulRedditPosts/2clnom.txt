LPT: Brush your teeth with your off-hand

content:
I learned this when I broke my right hand and was forced to do everything with my left.  I found that brushing my teeth was one of  the harder things I had to do every day, but after only a day or two it was much easier.  I've continued this practice until this day 

It is a great way to increase your strength and dexterity in your off hand, without having to do any extra working out.  This can be especially helpful for athletes who play sports where ambidexterity can give an advantage, like basketball or baseball.

EDIT: as others have mentioned, this can also help keep your brain healthy, by strengthening neural pathways which aren't frequently used ~~between the left and right brain~~

EDIT 2: Always be sure to brush gently and thoroughly, regardless of which hand you are using.
