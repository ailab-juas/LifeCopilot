LPT: If a dealership calls you to get you to re-sign a contract with worse terms, DON’T. Even if by $1 worse. Same for any other contract. Never, ever, ever, re-sign

content:
I just read a (now deleted) post about someone asking if they should re-sign because a dealer called them several times for $600 more down and a higher interest rate from 5.1% to 6.1%, or something like that. I got motivated to build off my comment to that post and add it to this sub.

**1a.** Always read the terms of any contract you sign. I like to read a contract at least 2x. If you need help (fine print and often confusing language) do your research and use the many free resources online to ask for help (like in 
r/legaladvice).

 **1b.** Be very careful to always redact any personal, identifying information about yourself whenever asking for help on said contract.

**2.** Don’t ever, ever re-sign if the terms are worse for you. Even if by $1 worse. Never ever. That goes for literally any contract you sign. Worth repeating: **any contract**.

**3a.** If the dealership, or any other contract source calls you again or just doesn’t take no for any answers, just simply say: “Well, I’ve already said no, but let me check with my lawyer. They’re great at contract law. They’ll know how to advise me on this”.

 **3b.** Whether or not you have (or even know a lawyer) is irrelevant. The people who’re calling you to re-sign will probably shit their pants and stop calling you at the mention of you saying the world “lawyer”. If you don’t have the car, or if the contract source is holding your product or service due to you hostage, they’ll probably expedite the delivery of said product or service to you once you say that line.

 **3c.** If you want to go a step further to get an Ace up your sleeve, I’d advise you post to r/legaladvice, with the same exact thing you’ve posted here and ask for help. Say “I told them I’d check with my lawyer, but I don’t have one. As a lawyer, paralegal, or someone who knows the legal angles here, what advice would you give me in how to deal with this”. Then follow that advice and stick to your wits. 

Good luck out there! **Never let anyone take advantage of you financially after you’ve already signed the contract.**

Edit 2: thanks to u/1decentusername below for advising to “calling the finance company you were initially approved with and telling them you want to file a Dealer Agreement Violation”.
