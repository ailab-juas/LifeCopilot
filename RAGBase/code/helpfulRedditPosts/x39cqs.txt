YSK: There is a website where you can actually find out how much medical care will cost at local hospitals before you go. The website is www.finestrahealth.com

Why YSK:

[The site](http://finestrahealth.com) has a map that says its currently available in Boston, NYC, Chicago, San Fran, and LA but it seems to be growing. (I donâ€™t remember seeing LA there when I checked on it yesterday but it's there now) Being able to find this info (and maybe shop around for the best price) will be so useful for me

**Update:** As per u/ambxshing's comment, this site only appears to currently work for hospitals in You should add that this website only works for hospitals in: San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City, and Boston.
