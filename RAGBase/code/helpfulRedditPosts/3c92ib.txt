title:
YSK not to go berry picking for a few days after heavy rains.

content:
In an abundance of rain the strawberries or blueberries or whateverberries soak up as much water as they can, so while they look super plump and perfect they're actually pretty flavorless.

Wait a few days for them to chill.
