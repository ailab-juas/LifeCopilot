title:
LPT: Stop Using Your Address for Lyft/Uber

content:
I recently had an experience that made me realize why you should not be using your home address as drop off or pickup location. Use the closest intersection.

&amp;#x200B;

I shared a Lyft ride with my female friend. The Lyft driver immediately started hitting on her. When he asked who was being dropped off first, I told him she was first stop. He started berating me for scheduling a ride and having her as first stop, started yelling about why he could not drop me off first.... During his tirade he got lost and when I tried giving him directions he just yelled at me. It was not amusing, it was scary - because now this drunk/high/creepy a-hole knew her address and mine.
