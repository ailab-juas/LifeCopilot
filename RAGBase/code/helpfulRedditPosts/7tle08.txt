YSK: If you find lost money at a place of business, check with the manager about what the store's policy is on lost and found money. Because you may not receive the money back after nobody claims it.

I work for a delivery company and went to a well-known pharmaceutical company's store and saw $20 in the ATM. I decided to do the right thing and hand it to the manager I get signatures from. While this made me feel good, the return visit two weeks later did not. When I asked if anyone had come to claim the $20 bill, the store manager (different manager) said no, and that head office said not to give me the $20 back. Which prompted me to say "so I should've just kept it then?" To which she replied "yeah."

Edit: So the best thing to do in this situation seems to be to take the money, report to the manager on duty that you found some money in the ATM and to leave your name and contact number with the manager. That way, you are responsible for returning the money to the proper owner (who should know the amount they lost) and also in control of what gets done with it if nobody claims it.
