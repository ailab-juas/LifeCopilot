YSK about Sumatra PDF, a (free!) quick loading pdf/ebook reader that loads nearly instantly and far, far outshines Adobe Reader XI in nearly every way!

^^* ^^I ^^suppose ^^I ^^should ^^start ^^this ^^out ^^by ^^saying ^^I ^^am ^^in ^^no ^^way ^^affiliated ^^with ^^Sumatra ^^PDF, ^^the ^^company, ^^the ^^creator ^^Krzysztof ^^Kowalczyk, ^^or ^^otherwise ^^in ^^any ^^way, ^^I ^^just ^^love ^^the ^^program! ^^*

 I have been using the program for about 10 weeks now and can honestly say that this fixes all the huge issues I had with Adobe Reader. My professors use a lot of PDF files for us to study and as such I may have 4 or five up at a time. They load SO SO much faster than Reader, scrolling is quicker, individual pages don't need to load, etc. I was trying to read one of my textbooks (an ebook) with Reader and its 600+ pages were taking **forever** to load.  But Sumatra PDF loads it almost immediately and each page is viewable nearly instantly. 

Seriously if you find Reader slow and cumbersome in any way, check out Sumatra PDF. It's my default PDF viewer, and I uninstalled Reader completely, there is nothing it does better than Sumatra PDF.

Check out the guy's website: (warning, ugly site) http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html

Or, if you'd rather download it from a (once) reputable website: http://download.cnet.com/Sumatra-PDF/3000-18497_4-10698785.html

Try it out, you won't be disappointed!
