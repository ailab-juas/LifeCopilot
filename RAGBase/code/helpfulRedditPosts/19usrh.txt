YSK Costco has a 90 day price guarantee. It saved me $175

content:
In early February I made an online purchase of a BlueAir 555EB Air Purifier for $650. In early March I received one of Costco's weekly emails and it had the same unit on sale for $475. So I emailed customer service, half expecting that nothing could be done. But they replied right away and told me about the 90 day price guarantee and that I would receive a $175 refund within five to ten days. Thank you Costco!
