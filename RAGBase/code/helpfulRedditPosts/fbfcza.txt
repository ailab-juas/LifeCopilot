title:
LPT Laugh at yourself when you do something embarrassing

content:
I’ve always been clumsy. As a kid, I was painfully shy AND clumsy. I learned that instead of getting embarrassed and making it even worse, if I laughed at myself and carried on like nothing happened, most others do too. Trip over my own shoelace and flail my shit everywhere? Get up laughing, if anyone else is looking, say something like “guess I should tie my shoes better huh?”, pick up my things and carry on.

Edit: OMG 1k upvotes! Thanks Reddit I feel special today (which,I think shows just how sad my life is)
Edit2: apparently using emojis is a bad thing here?! Reddit teach me your ways I’m the new-ish kid! (Shit I almost used another one)
