LPT: If you are ever tempted to tease someone for not knowing something, pause to consider where you learned it. They may not have had access to that resource.

I'm talking about friendly teasing, not outright mockery which is probably just not a very nice thing to do in any situation.

This is inspired by my getting to know a couple of people who spent much of their childhoods in the care system. They are doing great now, but have told me about their struggles to learn "basic" things on turning 18. Things like how money works or how to order at a restaurant. One of them talks about encouraging the frequent "typical blonde" jokes she would get because it was easier than the truth (i.e. "you learned that stuff from your parents but nobody put in that effort with me"). 

It made me feel very sheltered and I realised that there is a whole bunch of crap I take for granted. Everybody in life has access to different knowledge sources, different caregivers, different opportunities. A friendly tease might actually make someone feel pretty crappy about their situation. Let's just be nice to each other!

Edit: Lots and lots of kind people have responded to this post. You all rock.
