title:
YSK that the shortest route to a fire exit will be dictated by pushable doors.

content:
In almost all buildings (all new buildings), the fire doors that leads to the nearest fire exit will be push doors. This means that if you have to pull a fire door, you've probably gone too far.

edit 2: In an attempt to clarify, this YSK ONLY applies to fire doors. These will be placed in main corridors.
Your office door is not a fire door, neither is your bathroom door.

I have done my best to please the critics, both welcome and unwelcome. It is a general rule, but all rules are general.
