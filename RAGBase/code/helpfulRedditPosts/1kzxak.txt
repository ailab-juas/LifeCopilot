LPT: Easily become a clean and tidy person by making sure to leave your car, house, or apartment at least a little bit cleaner than it was when you entered it.

It's doing wonders for me. I would usually let junk accumulate and clean it later, now my car and apartment is pretty clean all the time. 

Edit: I appreciate the positive feedback. I guess it's in my nature to make a mess. I'd use something and toss it on the ground. This trick is the only thing that allowed me to be clean. Otherwise, I'd have a really messy apartment that I would only clean when my apartment was intolerable. I think people who are messy by nature are the ones who will reap the most benefits from this. I am glad this lpt is helping a lot of people. I am not a fan of the downvotes, I mean come on... it's already helping a lot of people!
