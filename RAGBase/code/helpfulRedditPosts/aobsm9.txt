LPT: If you're thinking about turning your hobby into a profession, be aware that it will no longer feel like a hobby in short order, and may not have anywhere close to the same enjoyment.

I'm sure this doesn't apply to every skilled hobbyist out there, but speaking for myself, and a lot of artists I've seen try to build successful businesses from their art, I can say that there is a good chance that you will hate what you do as much, if not more than whatever you're doing now for employment. Especially if you have no experience in self-employment or know how to manage yourself with discipline and dedication.

I've been building gaming terrain for a living for close to a decade now, most of that time it's been my primary income source, and while I build everything with passion and perfection that I take pride in, it also *suuuuuuuuuuucks.* I often hate working on this stuff and only feel enjoyment when I'm done and don't have to look at it on the worktable any longer. Before it was a profession I had great enjoyment for the process, but now I just can't help but count the minutes that I'm wasting, the cost-to-time-pay ratios, and so on. The business aspect of it has taken over my life completely and contributed to a real degradation in my mental health, culminating in a major breakdown last year.

If you're going to turn your hobby into a business:

* Start it as a side job, don't get ahead of yourself. Start slow and small.
* Manage your time, learn to put only a certain amount of time into your work per day, per week. 
* Never start getting in the habit of taking on more work than you can handle in those hours. Be strict about this.
* Avoid "Commission Hell" where you get backed up working on custom projects for people and at the same time have to do other work to keep the lights on.
* Charge appropriately. Don't sell too cheap because you're desperate to be seen. Don't charge more than your quality is worth. See what comparable work is being sold for and judge yourself critically.
* Cramming will destroy your soul. If you get in the habit of working past your scheduled hours into the wee hours of the morning to meet a deadline, you WILL burn out very quickly. If you're doing this, you don't have a good work ethic, you've made a mistake in your judgement of what you can accomplish.
* Motivation is a lie, a passing mood, if you wait for motivation to get work done, it will never get done. You need *discipline.* If you have a hard time with this regularly, you need to learn how to push yourself *before* you go into business for yourself.

Enjoy your hobbies as hobbies and only think of changing this dynamic if you are absolutely sure and driven to take it to another level. Keep your working life and your resting/recreation time separate, or you may end up regretting it.

Edit: Let me restate what I said at the top, since some people are dismissing the whole post. *This is a common occurrence with artists and hobbyists who take their passion and turn it to work*, it's **NOT THE RULE**. If you are doing what you love, wonderful. This doesn't always work for everyone though, and it's better to be prepared for something other than what you imagine going in or you might get in over your head and hate something you once loved. I'm not discouraging anyone from pursuing their passions, just the opposite, preserve your passions and pursue them with the right goals and mindset. Even the most fun activity is *work* when you have to do it 8 - 12 hours a day, so prepare yourself to *work.*
