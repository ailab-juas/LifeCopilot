title:
YSK that words like natural, artisanal, and traditional have no legal definition on food labels

content:
In light of the "natural brown sugar" post you all should know that there are other words (in addition to the ones mentioned in the title) that have no legal definition and can therefore just be added for marketing purposes. Applied to the EU and the US as well, though the US has even more loose definitions.

A product labeled "natural turkey breast" had listed it's ingredients as 45% turkey and 55% chicken.

Other words like traditional or artisanal also don't really mean anything and it just there to make the product sound more fancy.
