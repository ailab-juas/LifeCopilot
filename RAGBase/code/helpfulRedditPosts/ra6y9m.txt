LPT: this year, make you fancy/expensive gift from the parents and not Santa. Keep santa gifts inexpensive and relatively common. Children get confused when Santa doesn't give them expensive toys like he does with other kids.

Why LPT?

Growing up I always got amazing, expensive toys from Santa. One year I brought my just released Game Boy to school and told everyone santa had brought it to me.

This had upset some of my classmates because Santa had only brought them some realistic gifts, like socks and new shoes - I don't recall.

I do remember the kid asking me what I did for Santa to get such a gift, including what I put out for cookies and milk. He said his mom said they didn't need to and he was upset. She agreed to make some homemade cookies that he said turned out pretty bad. He wanted oreos because he seen that was in the TV. He thought for sure he made Santa mad by not giving him oreos.

I later worked for the YMCA and learned that a lot of parents struggle to give gifts to their kids and it affects them negatively because they don't understand why the rich popular kids got amazing gifts. This often leads them to believe that they are somehow broken, or damaged.

So, this year, and going forward - let Santa bring the socks, or pants and shirts. Mom and dad - let your children know you're the one that makes Christmas dreams come true.
