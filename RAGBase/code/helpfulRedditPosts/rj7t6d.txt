LPT: you want to really know someone ? tell them no

content:
edit: i don't mean playing weird manipulation games, just remembering that you don't really know someone if you never see them in such situations / pay attention to this kind of things

\---

or disagree with them, or see how they react while stucked in jam or when internet is down.

Globally, see how they react in middly frustrating situations.

It's easy to get along with someone when everything is fine. but disagreeing with them will really help you to spot people that are faking, eventually people with cluster B traits, people that are emotionally immature and so on.
