LPT: If you're ever at a job and in a situation where the higher-ups offer for you to resign to "avoid embarrassment" instead of terminating your employment, don't agree to resign unless you have something else lined up or you feel that the termination will ruin your CV.

Several years ago, at the start of my career basically, I wound up in this exact situation.  I was a young female in an industry mostly made up of males, and got caught up in a bit of a scandal with a member of the senior staff.  One day I was brought into Sr. Management's office and he said I have a choice ... that there would be an investigation done, I would be "suspended without pay" during the investigation, and everyone would know about what happened, and I would most likely be terminated at the end of the investigation ... or I could resign right then and there.

Being young, naive and new to the working world, I was scared, crying, and immediately offered to resign, and signed something to that effect.  When I went to file for unemployment, I was obviously denied, because I resigned "willingly".  Luckily, I was able to get another job offer within the month, so it wasn't that bad, and it was a way better job than the one I resigned from.

Looking back, I didn't do anything that warranted dismissal from my job, as I didn't break any employee policies or company bylaws and I definitely did not do anything illegal.  If I had known what I know now, I would not have resigned.

I know this is not applicable to ALL situations, but I wanted to put this out there because in the current economy, unemployment may be the difference in being able to buy groceries or not.  I was lucky that my situation occurred at a time when the economy was okay and I only had to tough it out for a month, but that's not the case right now.
