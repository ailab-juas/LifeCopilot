YSK The R.I.D.E. Method. Simple way to get through a Panic Attack.

From [Linda Walter LCSW](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-without-anxiety/201110/ride-the-wave-panic)

&gt;1) **Recognize** and accept that you're feeling anxious.

&gt;2) Once you're feeling anxious, immediately **Involve** yourself in your surroundings. Look around, pay attention to what's going on around you. Notice who's there, what people are saying, what the environment looks like.

&gt;3) Then I'd like you to **Distract** yourself. Talk to someone and really pay attention to the conversation, sing a song, read a magazine, or watch television. Try to become active in what you do, in other words, if you read a magazine, say the words aloud to yourself. The goal is to focus on something other than the panicky feelings you're experiencing.

&gt;4) When you are able to distract yourself away from your feelings, **the panic will End by itself**, without a struggle.

&gt;These steps are something you are going to have to practice, get used to and comfortable with. Please be patient with yourself. The technique probably will not come easily to you and will take some time to learn. If you have a long history of having panic attacks and have them frequently, you may want to consult with a mental health professional as you try this new approach.
