LPT: Before dropping your car at the repair shop, always remove your house key from your key ring

content:
Not sure whether this is considered common knowledge but it can be easy to forget. If thereâ€™s just one dishonest person at the repair shop, they could easily make a duplicate key and let themselves into your house later, since they know your address.  

This could apply to dropping your car with valet parking as well.
