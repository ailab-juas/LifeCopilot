YSK If you're not sure someone is gay, outing them or asking them if they are gay can be very traumatic and make them feel incredibly self-conscious, self-loathing, and shameful for days.

Coming out is a process. It has between 5 to 8 stages depending on where you find information about it. 

Even if you're "sure" someone is gay, unless they've told you, it's not your place to ask.

Before I was comfortable with myself, if someone said to me "are you gay?" I would immediately get a rush of adrenaline that would make everything slow down and speed up at the same time. I'd kind of stutter out a "no" and then I'd see how visably awkward the other person felt because they knew they'd hit a nerve. 

Afterwards, I'd spend days obsessing about what I did, how I acted, or what I said to make them think I was gay. Often I would distance myself from that person too because I didn't want to re-live that experience again.

I'm confident in saying every LGBT person has been made fun of as a child, or heard bad things said about being gay, so that's one reason self acceptance and coming out is so hard.

If you do suspect someone is gay, find subtle ways to let them know you're okay with LGBT people so when they're ready, they can feel more confident about confiding in you. Coming out is terrifying. You need to be able to accept that every person you tell may need just as much time to accept yourself as you did. Knowing someone is more likely to love you for who you are is incredibly helpful.

Also, when your friend is "out", don't tell other people they don't know. That's their job if and when it's necessary. Often times it's totally unnecessary, and it can compromise their safety or just make things needlessly awkward - even if your intentions are good.
