title:
YSK that having your lights on while driving in fog or rain is just as important for you to be able to see as it is for other drivers to see you

content:
Why YSK: Today is extremely foggy where I am and a little over 20% of the cars on the road did not have their lights on. Not only is this extremely dangerous it is technically illegal in many states. 

Please turn your lights on, you are not as visible as you think.

Edit: 
to everyone saying “but it’s common sense”. You’re right it is but that didnt stop the hundreds of people driving today that didn’t have their lights on. 

In terms of location: it is the massholes for me
