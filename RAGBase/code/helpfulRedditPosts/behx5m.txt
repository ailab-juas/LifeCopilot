LPT: If you are buying a tent for 2 people get a 3 person tent. For 3 people, a 4 person tent and so on.

When they say a tent fits 3 people, they mean 3 people that are not storing gear in their tent and that sleep like they are in a coffin. Even a 4 person tent for 2 people is ideal.

EDIT: After being away from internet at a camp, I jump back on briefly and WOW this blew up a bit. Thanks for my first ever silver, kind stranger!!
