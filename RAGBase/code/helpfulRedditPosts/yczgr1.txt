LPT: When my toddler is fighting bedtime or a nap, I start fake yawning to make him instantly sleepy

It took me 22 months to figure out this bedtime trick. Yawns are contagious so I'll fake a long, dramatic, sleepy yawn and then instantly watch my kid start yawning and his eyes get heavy. My wife thinks it's so funny and cracks up watching us yawn back and forth. Unless he is on hyper level 100, this works for my 2yo. YMMV.
