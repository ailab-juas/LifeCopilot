LPT: To figure out if you need to use “I” or “me” in a sentence, remove the other person or creature from it. For example, “My dog and me saw a deer” becomes “Me saw a deer” which doesn’t make sense, and you’ll know to say “My dog and I saw a deer” instead.

Thank you for the awards and thoughtful feedback!

::EDIT:: My dog and I actually saw cougar tracks, but that was too long for the character limit. Turns out cougars smell musky with a huge serving of primal “NOPE!”

::::EDIT 2:::: Many people forget that Reddit is accessible for people outside of English-speaking countries AND that most people have very limited recollection of what they did last year (or last week), let alone what they did in Elementary school. It’s a pro tip for anyone who needs it. Congratulations if you’re not it.

Soooo many people don’t know which to use, and this is the easiest way. Which one makes sense with just you in it? That’s the one you need.

I am a second-language speaker and first started learning English 27 years ago, and I have been teaching English in the USA for 6 years (on my 7th), have taught both middle and high school and tutor college-level.

It’s a solid trick for remembering. Most people seem to think they should know, and then they second-guess themselves OR speak/type/write some really silly-sounding sentences.
