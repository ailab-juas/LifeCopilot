title:
YSK that ordering UberEats on the web page usually costs more to book than from within the app.

content:
The app shows a preview of the price, the webpage tells you the price after you are checking out. I was looking up delivery for breakfast on my phone, but typing it in my computer when I noticed that it was $3 more to book online.

This isn't the first time.

This time I deleted the items from my webpage cart and ordered using the app instead.
