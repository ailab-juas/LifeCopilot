LPT: With the new year around the corner, make one of your resolutions to stop arguing with strangers on the internet.

content:
I did this a few years ago and it's been great for my mental and emotional well being. I realized there's no point in arguing with people online anymore. I can't even change the opinions of people I've known my whole life, so why do I think I'll be able to change the opinion of Larry from Wisconsin? When you see someone say something that irritates you and you want to refute it, simply close the browser tab and redirect your energy somewhere else. Trust me, you will be healthier and happier for it.
