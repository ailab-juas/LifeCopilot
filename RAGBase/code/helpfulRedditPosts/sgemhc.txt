title:
LPT: You can replace the water in a rice cooker with chicken or beef stock/broth to add flavor to a dish.

content:
Why LPT: Some dishes benefit greatly from the added flavor of the stock/broth. 


Bonus: Add a little extra rice to the cooker (before cooking) to keep rice from getting mushy. Like 1/4 more dry rice.



Edit: I'm glad everyone has enjoyed this post, however some have not been so happy:

"Tips for 8 year olds. Thanks. The real pro tip is you can add salt to food to make it better! Maybe even pepper!"

This person clearly only cooks with salt and pepper, so who am I to judge? LPT: Use Salt and Pepper In Your Food, now that's one pro tip I can definitely get behind.


Edit 2: I'm very happy you all have  give insight on how other alternative liquids can be used. As a Louisiana native, food brings people and cultures together and unites us all. I'm glad we could all come together in this post.
