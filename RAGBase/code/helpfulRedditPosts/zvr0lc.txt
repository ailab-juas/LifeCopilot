title:
YSK how to have multiple virtual desktops in Windows and how to flip between them really easily.

content:
Why ysk . Multiple desktops are great for keeping unrelated, ongoing projects organized—or for quickly switching desktops before a meeting. To create multiple desktops: 

On the taskbar, select Task view &gt; New desktop .

Open the apps you want to use on that desktop.

To switch to another desktop, select Task view again or (what I do ) is hold the cntrl and the windows key down and then use the left and right arrows to shift between them.

Edit. Few people asking, it’s not a virtual machine. It uses the same resources between desktops.
