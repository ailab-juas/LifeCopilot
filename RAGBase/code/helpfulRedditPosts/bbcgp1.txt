LPT: Carry around a card in your wallet/purse with some important phone numbers like parents or friends. If your phone dies or you don’t have it, you have all the numbers you need, and you can use a pay phone or borrow someone’s phone.

I think everyone considers this but no one really does it. I personally can’t remember more than 5 or so numbers. Ironically, I thought of this while walking home from the gym, but I had left my phone at my apartment to charge so I couldn’t post this yet lol. Hope this helps

Edit: my very first silver!?! Thank you kind stranger!!!
