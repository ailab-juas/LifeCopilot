YSK that romantic relationships aren't like the Sims. Doing nice things doesn't fill up a stat bar that, when full, means the person is in love with you.

Why YSK: Romantic relationships are important to many people's self confidence, identity, and mental health. Thinking like I used to kept me from having said relationships.

This is a big part of why I was single until my 30s. I'd find a girl I liked, and just start doing nice things and buying stuff all the time for her, and then get angry when she didn't want to date me and break off contact. Obviously, it was that all these girls were bitches, right?

No. Not everyone will like you. Even fewer will like you romantically. Even people who are really, really nice to you aren't necessarily romantically attracted to you. 

Most importantly (and this would have saved me so much grief in my 20s) NO ONE IS OBLIGATED TO LIKE YOU NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE TO THEM.

Don't lose out on your 20s like I did. Learn how to actually foster positive relationships, where you help each other's weaknesses and build on each other's strengths. Don't be some weird unwanted shitty creepy sugar daddy who doesn't realize that he isn't actually a nice person, but someone who will do and say anything to get laid under the thin, shitty veneer of being a "good dude."

I wasn't good to women in my 20s, and because of that, I missed out on a lot of great things.
