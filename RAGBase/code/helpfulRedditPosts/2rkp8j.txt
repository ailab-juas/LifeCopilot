LPT: When apologizing, replace the word "but" with a pause

content:
It allows you to explain yourself while still sounding wholehearted.

eg "I'm sorry but I'm trying my best." becomes
"I'm sorry. I'm trying my best."

EDIT:
Why do apologies have to be unconditional? Just because you've done something wrong doesn't instantly absolve the other party of any responsibility or make any other factors out of your control irrelevant. Some people demand an apology even when it's not completely your fault.

EDIT 2: Thanks Lifehacker!
