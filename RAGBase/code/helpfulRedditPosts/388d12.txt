LPT: Loosen your lug nuts before jacking the car up when changing a tire.

content:
Key word being LOOSEN, do not remove you lug nuts until the car is jacked up. I was helping a coworker who had never had to change a tire before and thought of posting this. Anyone that's ever had to remove a tire before knows the lug nuts can be a royal pain in the ass. Once you have the car jacked up (especially if it's just the scissor jack that comes with it) banging and torquing on the lug wrench get's a little scary. Save yourself the worry and break the lugs loose before putting it in the air. 

Bonus tip--If you have a long drive it's not a great idea to put different size tires on your drive wheels because it stresses the differential. If you plan on taking the car straight to have the tire repaired or replaced don't worry about it. If for example though you have a long commute ahead of you, and you drive a front wheel drive car instead of putting the doughnut on the front, put it on in place of a good back tire (assuming all your tires are the same size), then put the back tire on in place of the front tire.

Edit: Yes this should be common since, but clearly it's not....sorry.

Also another thing I remember from my first 'emergency' tire change, be careful with the old tire. My girlfriend at the time had a tire blow pop. I got the tire of no problem, started rolling it to the trunk and sliced my hand wide open on a exposed tire cord. I had never seen a tire this worn out before, and that shit hurt like hell.
