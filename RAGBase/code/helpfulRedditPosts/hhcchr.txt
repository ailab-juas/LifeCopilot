LPT: Tell your professor or teacher as quickly as you can if there’s something going on that will affect your performance in class.

content:
You don’t have to go into a huge amount of detail, but give them a heads up. E-mail if you have to, but making an appointment or dropping by office hours for a few minutes goes a long way. 

If it’s an ongoing problem, it’s far, FAR better to let a professor know 2 weeks into the course that life is kicking your butt and you’re in the weeds than to wait until the week before the final and go in and say that your whole semester is like that. They will often have great ideas to help you, or maybe will just be more understanding in regards to things like attendance. 
If you wait till the end of the semester it will come across as “I saw my grade and panicked, here’s the thing”. If something crazy happens DURING the semester, let the teacher know once it’s possible to do so. 

I’ve been on both the student and the teacher sides, and it kills me when a student struggles through the course because of health, family, financial, whatever difficulties because I was that kid and it cost me. As an instructor, if I know that there’s a problem then 9 times out of 10 I can suggest resources or the like that will help, or I can personally do something to help. 10 times out of 10 I can listen.
