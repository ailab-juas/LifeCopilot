title:
YSK antibiotics are not a cure-all and that the misuse of antibiotics promotes antibiotic resistance.

content:
Consequences of medication-resistant infections include longer recovery and steeper healthcare costs. In the long term, easily treatable diseases such as pneumonia or tuberculosis could become incurable. 

Colds, the common flu, bronchitis and most coughs (caused by viruses) **cannot** be treated by antibiotic consumption.

On the other hand, if you have a bacterial illness diagnosed by your doc such as strep throat or a UTI, it is important to finish your antibiotics as the full treatment is required to kill the disease-causing bacteria.
