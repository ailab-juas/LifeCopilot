YSK how to make a vinaigrette. It's a multi-use sauce good for use on salads, as a meat marinade, and flavor booster for vegetables.

**Why YSK.** Basic cooking skills are easy and can greatly expand your food options. A vinaigrette (a diminutive of the French *vinaigre,* or vinegar, and the origin of the term "French dressing") is a mix of 3 parts oil and 1 part vinegar. What oil? What vinegar? Doesn't really matter. You can experiment on your own, but can use what you have. (Olive oil and red wine vinegar, for example.)

With the 3 parts oil and 1 part vinegar you can then add an emulsifier. Oil and vinegar don't mix very well, and if you don't have the emulsifier you end up with a vinaigrette that will taste like only vinegar one bite and only oil the next. The emulsifier will allow these two liquids to blend together.

There are a lot of emulsifiers, but in general mustard and mayo are the best for taste and stability. (Egg yolk is best as a long-term emulsifier, but the taste isn't great.) Adding a teaspoon of mayo and mustard (any kind, but Dijon is always great) is going to allow the mixture to stay mixed for a half hour at least.

After that, it's all up to you. Want a sweeter sauce? Honey, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, etc. A brighter sauce? Lemon juice, pineapple juice, etc. Salt and pepper, garlic, herbs, and almost anything you want can go into a vinaigrette. Experimenting or using what you have is always an option, and as long as you keep the two main ingredients in mostly correct proportions, you may be surprised how much you can do with a vinaigrette.

**Basic vinaigrette recipe**

* 3 Tablespoon oil
* 1 Tablespoon vinegar
* 1 Teaspoon dijon mustard
* 1 Teaspoon mayonaise
* Salt and pepper to taste

Add all ingredients to a bowl and whisk together until blended. Use as a salad dressing, meat marinade, or as a finisher to roasted veggies. (You can also leave out the mayo or mustard, but try to include at least something as an emulsifier. Tomato paste, roasted garlic, tahini, avocado, and others are useful here.)

**Options**

* **Sweet note**. 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup
* **More acid!** 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* **Savory punch.** MSG and garlic
* **Spicy spice.** Red pepper flake, cayenne, or your hot sauce of choice.
