YSK in the US you can receive compensation if you are an innocent victim of a crime. This includes your medical bills, treatment, and meds being paid for. Here is a link to a list of each states crime victims services.

Here is a list of each states crime victims services. They cover a lot of expenses and more people need to know about this.

I originally posted this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/1db5iv/did_anyone_see_me_get_jumped_on_pacific_ave/c9orxrr) where it was suggested by /u/Yukahana to post it here.

/u/El_Morro added this information for immigrants in less than ideal situations:
&gt;Additionally, immigrants who do not have status (or who's permission/visa has expired), who have been victims of a crime (including domestic violence) may be able to get a "U-Visa" to allow them to stay in the country: [1] http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=c70ab2036b0f4110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=db029c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD

&gt;Bonus- the person doesn't have to provide all the information the police need. Just that they've been cooperative and will continue to be cooperative with the investigation and persecution.



  
Edit1: added /u/El_Morro immigrant information  
Edit2: added link to Oregon because the one in the main list is not working.
