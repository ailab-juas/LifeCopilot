title:
YSK that in “essential oils,” the word “essential” is not synonymous with “important” or “necessary”

content:
In the case of essential oils, the word essential just means that the oil contains the essence (i.e., smell) of whatever substance from which it was derived. 

Why YSK: if you think these oils are “essential” to your health you might be more inclined to waste your money thinking you’ll receive a medical health benefit. Not to say there aren’t benefits, but when one hears “essential!” they might think they’re necessary or important.
