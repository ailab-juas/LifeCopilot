LPT: Learn the survival backstroke, especially if you swim in the sea or big lakes. This stroke could save your life and is not taught at most schools.

content:
I swam at school from a young age and learned all the normal strokes but was never taught this stroke and as a surfer I probably use this the most, if you're caught in a situation where you are exhausted and need to swim a fair distance this is the most efficient stroke to use, also teaches people to swim/float on their backs which is advice given by RNLI here in the UK.
