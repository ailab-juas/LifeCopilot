LPT: A good end of interview question

content:
So I asked this at my last interview and I’ve now been with the company 2 and a half years. The question I asked is “based on what we’ve spoken about today would you have any hesitancies in hiring me for this job role?”
It gets it all out in the open if they have any issues you then get a chance to refute them or make your case. It also gives you an inclination as to if you’ll get a call back.

Edit: Wow! Thanks for all the comments guys. (And the awards!) Some of you have suggested even better questions to ask, I’m just glad to have gotten people sharing theirs too and talking about this topic.

Edit 2: So a few people have mentioned the wording is a little off, it may have been “any hesitancies in my ability to do this job role” as opposed to hiring for the role. Looking back this may have been closer to the original wording I used, my apologies!
