LPT: If you need to get rid of an unwanted erection, bend over with your knees locked straight as far as you can comfortably go, and take three or four big deep breaths.

Most commonly useful to eliminate a 'morning glory' before the customary morning pee. 

In a conference or classroom setting, when you suddenly need to present, "dropping" something and slowly picking it up wihout bending your knees while taking some quick deep breaths, might save you the embarrasment of your presentation being overshadowed by a pants-tent.

Try it with your next erection to lock this trick into your memory, and I think you'll be amazed how quickly they disappear.
