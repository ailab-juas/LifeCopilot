YSK: Ask before cleaning someone’s house, especially if they just suffered a loss

content:
Why YSK: something you may think is nothing or just trash could be emotionally tied to something or someone. 

For example, when my grandma lost her youngest son (he was 2 at the time) her sister decided to help clean up the house. She wiped off the crayon marks from the walls, those were put there by my grandmas son. She didn’t get them all though, I grew up with crayon marks from my uncle that I had never met. I was sad to see them painted over last year (24 years after his death) 


My aunts dog passed recently. My grandma almost wiped the smudges off her front window but thought “maybe these were out there by Maggie (the dog)” and they were, she used to rub her nose against the window when she saw people walking up the drive way. My aunt said she didn’t want to clean them off yet, it’s a way to remember Maggie.
