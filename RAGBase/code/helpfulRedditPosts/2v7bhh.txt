YSK that as of August 2014 cell service providers can no longer prevent you from unlocking your phone

content:
The "Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act " (S. 517) overturns the Library of Congress' attempts to prevent phone unlocking under the DMCA. Whereas in the past carriers could make it nearly impossible to unlock a cell phone, it is now much easier to do so. AT&amp;T, for example, provides [an online form for you to request your phone's unlock code](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/).
