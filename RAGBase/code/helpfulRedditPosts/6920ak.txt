LPT: If you see someone is misinformed about something, educate them; don't belittle them.

Edit: I was not referring to politics or religion when I wrote this. Also, there's a difference between someone who is misinformed and someone who has a different opinion to you. Just because two people have different views on something; doesn't necessarily mean that either of them is wrong. 

Also I just wanted to clear up that I'm not American, I'm from England so pls stop confronting me about Trump/Trump supporters as I don't know an awful lot about American politics.
