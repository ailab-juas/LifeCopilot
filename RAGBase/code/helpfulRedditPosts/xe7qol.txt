LPT: If shopping for paint in a big box store, take the color samples to the lighting aisle.

content:
I work in a Paint Department and you don't know how many times I've saved couples from making big color mistakes by instructing them to take the time to walk the samples 100ft down to the lighting aisle to look at the color under different bulb temperatures. Warehouse lighting is usually bright and harsh and the colors will 100% look differently at home. By visiting the Lighting department you can get an idea of how the color will look in different environments.

Edit: wow this blew up! I'm glad so many of you like this advice. I just want to add, the absolutely best way to choose a color is to buy samples, take them home, paint a section of the wall, and spend a day staring at the colors. BUT, not everyone has that amount of patience...
