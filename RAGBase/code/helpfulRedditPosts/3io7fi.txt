title:
YSK You can't keep a gold fish in a bowl

content:
I work at a pet store and every day I have to explain to people why they can't put a goldfish in a simple bowl. Some people are happy to be educated, others don't care and go ahead with it anyways. I thought this would be a good place to inform people or parents who want to get their kid a fish.

-Goldfish need a minimum of 29 gallons of water, either a tank with a filter or a pond

-They are twice as dirty as other fish, they actually create more ammonia which can pollute the water and kill them. You need a filtered tank for them

-They aren't small. Those tiny goldfish in the pet shop can range from 6 to 36 inches and some are able to live for 25 plus years. 

-"But I had a goldfish that lived in a bowl for like, three years" exactly, the size of the bowl couldn't sustain the fish and it died 20 some odd years before it should have.

-A good alternative for a **large** fish bowl (2.5 gallons or more) is a betta (siamese fighting fish) as they can survive without  a filter/heater but will thrive in a 10 gallon with a heater/sponge filter/lots of plants and decor.
On this topic, betta's are air breathers so they should not live in more than a foot of water or else they can't reach the surface for air. This is a general rule, but not mandatory. Please do not put bettas in those tall, thin vases as they are beautiful fish that require more than that. If you do not use a filter (2.5 gallons does not require it) then you must be vigilant about cleaning their home as they still produce ammonia. If you don't use a heater make sure it is in a warm part of the house. 

-A simple rule for fish is a gallon per water per inch of fish. A zebra danio fish can be 2 inches, therefor you need to reserve 2 gallons of your tank for that one fish. 

-With a gold fish you have to add 10 gallons per fish as they create more ammonia.

-Lastly, some people will keep small gold fish in bowls for a short period to allow them to grow before placing them in something larger, which I feel is fine as big gold fish will eat the little ones.

Hope this helps!

EDIT 2: If you'd like to learn more about betta's here a site on caring for them: http://bettacare101.com/mythvsreality/  I should note that they will not thrive in a tiny bowl, but can live in something 2.5-10 gallons (ideally 10 gallons with a heater and lots of plants!)

**EDIT 3: I see we have some betta lovers here! I updated my post so as to not misinform anyone on the care of bettas.**

EDIT 4: I don't know what gold does, but thank you. 

Last EDIT: Here's a goot resource on gold fish misconceptions and care written by a fellow redditor, /u/Mcfarlanek  : http://www.tropicalfishcareguides.com/goldfishcare/can-goldfish-live-in-a-bowl/ It explains, in an easy to follow manner, what goldfish need and why we should ultimately ban fish bowls (which I think a lot of betta lovers can agree with!)
