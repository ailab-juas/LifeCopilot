LPT do not help someone working at your home, unless they ask for it.

content:
My job requires me to do some work at the customer's home, and while some of my peers don't mind someone watching them, they all hate when a customer "tries to help us out" by doing some of the work we're supposed to do.

We have methods, metrics and goals that we have to abide by, and accomplish. If you end up messing something up, now we as the employee are blamed for it.

On a similar note, if you have a pet, don't assume that we're okay hanging around the pet, we don't want the pet hurting us, or us hurting the pet. Please put it in a room or cage. Also please don't ask if we're okay with the pet, just put it away. Many companies will fire employees for working in the vicinity of a pet as it may cause a liability.
