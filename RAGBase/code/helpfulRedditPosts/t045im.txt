LPT: institute a “two taps” policy during sex.

content:
Whenever you particularly like something that your partner is doing in bed, tap them twice (like with your index finger) and have them do the same. It’s seamless, instant communication (even if mouths are occupied) that helps you learn what your partner likes. It makes sex more personal and satisfying, and everyone likes knowing their partner is having a good time!

I’ve found this particularly useful for teaching someone to eat pussy. It’s often hard to communicate specifics (“I like when you swirl your tongue clockwise”) verbally in the moment and newbies tend to be timid or self conscious. 

Source: I’m an ex call girl. No faster way to being a great lay than communication.

ETA: or it can be a squeeze or a pinch or fucking anything. If two taps already means something with your partner, pick something else. 

ETA2: NEVER just use two taps to say no without telling your partner that’s what it means in advance. It’s by no means a universal sign, as evidenced by this tip. 

For me, “stop” is always a verbal signal like a safe word or just “give me a sec,” cuz I’ve been sexually assaulted so two taps would be too subtle for my comfort zone. But having a nonverbal signal for “this is good” in addition to a signal for “this is bad” makes sex better
