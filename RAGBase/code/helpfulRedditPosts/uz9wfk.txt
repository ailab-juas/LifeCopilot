LPT- you never really know somebody until you see them when they’re angry, rejected and hurt

content:
Don’t ignore the way they treat others or the things they say. Because when you face their wrong side (and it’ll come whether you have done something or not) then it’s your turn. 

Keep your distance from inconsistent people, you most often can see the signs very early on.
