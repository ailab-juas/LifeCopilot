YSK you can save hundreds of dollars on car rentals if you book through USAA. They give you a discount and don't charge underage fees if you are under 25. You don't even have to be a military member.

Basically just click through [their rental car site](https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/rental_cars_main) at the bottom of the page to whichever company you want to use.

If you use the link on the page, it uses a certain "discount code" that gives you a discount and removes the underage fees (if you are under 25).

When I did it I used Hertz. I just booked it on the website, and when I picked up the car at the airport they didn't give me any hassle or ask for any proof that I was a USAA member either. I paid the remaining balance and drove off.

I don't use USAA for anything else either. Anyone can do this and it is completely free. All you have to do is create an account online.


I went through the checkout process with and without USAA for a Nissan Versa, 1 week in Orlando, picking up at MCO. I entered my age as "23-24." There's a $240 difference.
