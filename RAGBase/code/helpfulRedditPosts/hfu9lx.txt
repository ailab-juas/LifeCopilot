YSK: Don't let anyone tell you the that the event which finally got you to cut ties with a person doesn't justify the act. No matter how small it's STILL the final straw.

I recently cut ties with a person I've known for over 10 years. 

There were *so many* things along the way that I should have seen as a reason to get out, but I didn't.

Instead I made allowances, justified behavior, "humoured" it, put up with it, for *years*.

The final straw, the thing event which got me to pull my head out of my rear end and cut ties? A smirk.

It was a smirk at the fact that I wasn't doing well. I *almost* didn't see it. But I happened to see the face of this person, at a low moment for me, and they were *smiling*.

For whatever reason, it put *everything* into perspective.

I realized that my "friend" *enjoyed* my suffering. Thrived on it, actually. I saw evil and malice in that smirk and suddenly confronted what I had known for a long time; this person was actively harming my wellbeing.

I cut ties right then and there, told them to get out of my house and haven't spoken to them since. I've felt *so much* relief.

You'd think they would react with surprise, try to apologize, make up. But they haven't at all. Almost as if they knew *exactly* what they were doing, and they knew the jig was up.

Now, I could go into great detail about *what* this person has done, but that doesn't matter to you. And it's not the point.

The point is, the final straw wasn't some big blow up, it was a small act. If I were explain this to others, they may not understand, say I should "give them a second chance". But that's bull.

When you know, you know. Don't let anyone tell you you're wrong.

If you're truly a genuine and honest person, and someone in your life is taking advantage of that, confront it. End it. Don't look back.

Edit: Taking a short break but in the middle of a DnD campaign so I don't have time to respond to everyone.

Just wanted to say that I really appreciate the comments and I'm glad to hear that many of you found encouragement in reading my post. It was also encouraging for me. Thank you.
