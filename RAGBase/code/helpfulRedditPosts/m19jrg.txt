My friend had this happen today!  There is a pocket in in the door of the Ford Transit van that looks like it is MADE for cell phones (it otherwise does not appear to have any purpose).  Yes there was a little sticker that looked like a no smoking sticker... My friend thought that was what it was.  I saw it and thought it was pointing out the cell phone pocket, but since I wasn't driving, I wanted to use my cell phone.  My friend put the phone in the pocket and closed the door... This video (not ours) demonstrates what happened.

Why YSK:  If you rent a Transit van to move items, pay attention to the pockets and don't put your cell phone in the pocket in the door that looks like it is for phones or it will get broken.

edit to add TLDR (written by [sleauxbreaux42](https://www.reddit.com/user/sleauxbreaux42)):

THE POCKET IS PLACED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DASHBOARD WILL CRUSH YOUR CELL PHONE WHEN THE DRIVER DOOR IS CLOSED.
