Why YSK responding appropriatly can save your life and possibly others. If asphyxiation is suspected immediatly leave the area and call emergency services. 
I saw a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IrrationalMadness/comments/inkr87/wcgw_swimming_into_suspiciously_looking_well/) (warning NSFL) where a guy jumps into a murky well and does not surface. The presumed context was high CO2 concentration. Someone said that the cameraman's inaction likely killed the swimmer. THIS IS UNTRUE AND VERY DANGEROUS INFORMATION. [Inert Gas Asphyxiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas_asphyxiation) IS DEADLY! With inert gasses there is no scent or visable warning. 1 or 2 breaths is all that is needed to become unconscious. Without proper breathing equipment any attempt at recue can become immediatly fatal. [A family of four and 1 farm hand died as a result of "domino effect" as each person attempted to save the last in a dairy farm manure pit.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19580177/ns/us_news-life/t/two-kids-among-five-killed-methane-gas/) You should know about the danger of inert gas asphyxiation as it can save lives. In training for these situations it is common to be told if someone succumbs to a potential gas leak to assume they are dead and to leave the area before you die too. Be safe out there.

Edit: spelling and grammar

Edit: A lot of people are asking if they can hold their breath and help the other person. The answer is yes (/s),  IF YOU WANT TO DIE. You cannot lift and carry a human person up stairs ( or possibly down) while holding your breath. The training is always clear. DO NOT ENTER  (without SCBA) OR ELSE YOU BOTH DIE. 

Edit: ~~Can anyone find the gif where the old white guy throws a flare into a hole and all the villagers watch as the smoke settles at the boundary of the gas layers? I thought that would be a good visual for people and I've seen it in the front page before but cant find it anywhere.~~
