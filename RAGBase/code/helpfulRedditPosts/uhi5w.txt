title:
If you keep your wallet in your back pocket and sit on it...don't.

content:
I sat on my wallet for about 5 years. Now my hips are out of alignment which, in turn caused back pain. It's been another 5 years since, without sitting on my wallet and I feel better already, but still have to visit a chiropractor once a month.

It's not worth it guys. 

Edit: For all you "keep less in your wallet" people, what about all my credit card sized tools? I have a credit card sized knife and multi tool that come in very handy a lot! 

And yes it does seem stupid to put your wallet in your back pocket. I don't know why I ever started.

And I've never been to a chiropractor in my life. I've been to many doctors though and they've all helped my back. I just thought it would make more sense to say chiropractor.
