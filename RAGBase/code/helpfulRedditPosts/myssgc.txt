LPT: A blanket under you can be just as good as a blanket on top of you.

content:
Especially in colder climates, camping or sleeping on an air mattress. The fabric under you acts as a heat barrier.

I didn't believe this until I moved to a new house, no heater and only a blow up mattress. Slept with 6x blankets on me and woke up cold. Switched to 3x under and 3x on top and I was toasty! A very minor example, but it works in a lot of cases.
