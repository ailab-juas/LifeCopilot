I use reddit very less but i like it a lot. I never knew that reddit community is such a vast. I wanted to see how many subreddits are there in reddit which are active and ended up making this long list of 5000+ subreddits. I found this list previously submitted by someone at /r/YouShouldKnow, so i thought why not to bring it back for those who missed.

**Note: This list is a mix of NSFW and SFW, so check it before you open any of them.**

Here is the List - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Agpb7THmQnOtdGRzcnNZSGVZcmlQVUM5aXVQS2NPUWc#gid=0

**This list again back for those who missed it 7 months back!**
