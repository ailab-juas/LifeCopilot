LPT: If your child spends a large amount of time hanging out at one specific neighborhood kid's house, send that mother a nice note or treat every few weeks.

content:
I *am* that mother. Due to various circumstances, the neighborhood kids spend the majority of time in my house. (For example, Kid A can't have friends over because he has large scary dogs, and Kid B has a baby brother that seems to be sleeping constantly.) I love that I have a place where everyone feels welcome, and I love that my child has friends to play with. These kids eat a good amount of my food and drink lots of my drinks (I do set limits, and I provide as much as I can). I am okay with this, as I would rather my child be here at home instead of at someone else's home. However, it would be nice if the other kids' parents would occasionally say thanks for what I do for their kids. I love being a mom, and I still love to have these kids over regardless, but a little appreciation would really make things easier.
