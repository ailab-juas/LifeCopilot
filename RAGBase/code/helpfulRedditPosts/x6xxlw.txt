LPT: If you are in the market to buy a car, get a pre-approved loan from your own bank and take it to the car dealer. They will bend over backwards to beat it and keep the financing in-house.

content:
If they beat your terms than it costs nothing for the loan pre-approval aside from a potential credit check , and you are under no obligation to use it, but by you having your own financing you can dictate your terms completely.  The power shift is palpable.
