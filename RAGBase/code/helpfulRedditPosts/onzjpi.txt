LPT: Live where you have weekly tornado siren tests? Give your pets treats at the shelter when the siren sounds.

content:
We’ve done this for about a decade.  Our siren goes off every Saturday at noon - so we act all excited and give the dogs cheese at the shelter.  Now, whenever the siren sounds we don’t have to try to round up the dogs - they’re waiting for us at the shelter.

Edit: the “shelter” referenced is a tornado shelter.  It’s a steel box designed so you can ride out a tornado.  I live in the tornado capitol of the world.
