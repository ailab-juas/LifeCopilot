LPT: Save money when grocery shopping; don't assume that bigger=cheaper

content:
Supermarkets are well aware that most people assume buying products in bulk is cheaper. It's true for the most part, but they will exploit this. There may be products in store where buying two small boxes can actually work out cheaper than one big box. Two examples i've seen recently are washing up liquid and laundry detergent, in Dunnes Stores and Tesco (Ireland)

unfortunately it can hurt your head trying to work out the price per weight and comparing almost every product you buy, but if you have time and are trying to save money then do this!


Another reason not to buy in bulk, is when you see something like 5 bars of chocolate on sale. Don't buy them thinking "oh they'll last me 5 days/weeks etc", because you're more likely to just give into temtpation and eat them all in one sitting...
