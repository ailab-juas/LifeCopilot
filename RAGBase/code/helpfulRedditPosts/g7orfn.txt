LPT: Don’t say anything negative about someone’s appearance that they cannot change/fix in 20 seconds.

I read this somewhere online years ago and it has stuck with me. I love this tip because it is a simple way to make sure you can be helpful without being socially awkward! 

For example, if someone has a hair sticking sideways or food in their teeth (and in some circumstances, their clothes are on inside out, if there is a room they can change in nearby) if you tell them, generally no matter where they are, they can fix it easily and quickly. 

On the other hand, if you say “oh that (insert clothing item here) is too short or not flattering” or “you’ve got a huge pimple”, you are not being helpful. That is not easily fixed or changed and could cause the person to be insecure about their looks that day or they may overthink it. Also, if you think about some of the possibilities here, you might find it’s just your personal opinion on what you would wear, how you would do your hair/makeup etc. and you are being unkind rather than being helpful.

Hope this helps someone! :)

EDIT: wow, didn’t expect this to take off so fast! So, just for clarity - 20 seconds is a rough guide to indicate a relatively quick and easy fix. Take it with a grain of salt, it could be a minute, just use common sense as to what the situation is, if you know the person etc.

Also, if someone has shit/wet/bled somewhere, or something of that nature, discreetly tell them and offer help to get somewhere to fix themselves up.

Basically, be a decent human being. If you’re close to the person, then you should be able to judge what to say and when based on how you know they will react and process it.
