LPT: If your dog destroys their tennis balls, switch to racquet balls. They are virtually indestructible and don’t get nasty when wet.

I have a Maltese that can devour a tennis ball in 5 minutes flat and a Duck Toller that likes to drop them in the water bowl. We switched to racquet balls a couple years ago and still have the original 3 we purchased. Their teeth can’t penetrate the material and they clean up and wipe off super easy. Plus they stay bouncy!
