LPT: If you have a hard time staying active after work do NOT sit down once you get home.

content:
I've found that if I sit down for just a minute after work I usually end up being lazy or skipping a workout that day. On the other side of things, when I come home and change right away (plus putting on my running shoes) I tend to jump right into my workout routine very easily.
