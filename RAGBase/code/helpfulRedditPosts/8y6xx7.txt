LPT: If youâ€™re trying to eat healthier or lose fat, after buying fresh fruits or veggies, pick/cut/wash them asap for healthier snacking and quicker availability. The tendency when snacking is to grab-and-eat rather than taking time to fully prepare. Unhealthy food can be too conveniently available.
