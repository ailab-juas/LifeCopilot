LPT: For southerners who are not used to ice, walk like a penguin.

content:
I grew up in MN so i take this as a given; but after watching a half dozen people slip on the ice in NC during snowpocalypse, I decided to post. If you want to walk on ice (or smooth snow), walk like a penguin (legs straight, short strides). Obviously, it's better to choose chunky snow or pavement (but watch out for black ice!), but sometimes you need to go on ice, so watch your step! Good luck pedestrians!

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments and the gold! Of course, other people also have good techniques, it's best to avoid ice and there is no substitute for good gear (boots, mittens, hat)!
