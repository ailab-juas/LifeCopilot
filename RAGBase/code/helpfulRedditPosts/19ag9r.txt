LPT: In interviews, when you're stuck for words, silence is your best friend.

content:
When you're searching for words in an interview, simply say nothing. The pause will both give you time to think and show your interviewer that you're being reflective or giving extra thought to what you want to say next.  If you use words such as "uh", "like", or "um", you come off as indecisive.  

You may fear that your pauses are too long, but that's rarely a concern. If you're prepping for an interview, record yourself and listen. You'll notice that those pauses aren't really as long as you think.

Bonus: If you really have trouble getting rid of "like", try subbing it out with "for instance". Having to think every time you say it will dramatically lessen your use of the phrase and you'll sound more intelligent in the process.
