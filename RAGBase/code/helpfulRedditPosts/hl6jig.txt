title:
LPT If somebody apologizes to you and you dont accept it and they get mad, they dont actually care how you feel

content:
Don't let anybody bully you into accepting an apology if they truly regret their actions then they will be willing to wait until you no longer feel hurt.

I know it might seem obvious but in the moment it's easy to forget.

Edit: Guys I meant apologizes about the big things that have really bad consequences, not things like sorry for bumping into you. I didn't mean for this to come across as narcissistic.
