LPT: When your SO calls you when they're down, they're not looking for solutions from you. They just want you to listen.

content:
I found out the hard way, but I've come to realize that when your SO is on the phone in a generally complainy mood, they're that way because you're one of the few people that they can be that way with.
Remember, it's is not about you, it's about them. Let go of your ego for one conversation.
