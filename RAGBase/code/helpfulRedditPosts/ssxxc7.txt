LPT: teach yourself to be atleast slightly ambidextrous.

Hi. In a nutshell, I broke my dominant hand during armwrestling and now I am stuck with my left arm until my right arm is healed. I have seen this same title earlier in my life and now that I am in this situation, just wanted to remind you all.
Ps. Never arm wrestle if you are drunk. It's never a good idea. Peace and love.

Edit: fixed a typo.
I also unmarked nsfw cause I wasnt aware why its usually used. I am a bit simple.
