title:
YSK that its illegal for a restaurant to make a server pay for a dine and dash

content:
Why YSK: Many servers do not know or understand their rights. With these tough times, I've experienced this myself as a Bartender and had my restaurant try this on me. I know other servers are all experiencing a huge increase in dine and dashers. Top it off with most people only tipping 10% and its miserable. 

My restaurant in California tried this on me recently. I showed them the law and told them it wasn't happening. They did not like that but they let it drop because to fire me over it would be an insane lawsuit. I'm going to quit soon but thats a different story. 

YSK also that every state is a little different. Some states do allow it conditionally, but if you know your states laws, the restaurant will probably not mess with you. A lawsuit can dig up a nasty past and nobody can afford back pay right now. Bassisically, if they make it a problem, and you make it a bigger problem (lawsuit) they will go out of business. Especially right now. 

This applies to a lot of things, like working off the clock, owners/managers taking tips, meetings / writeups off the clock, and many other small tricks they use to save money from you. 

TLDR: If a restaurant threatens your paycheck, stand up them. They are probably legally wrong, can't afford a lawsuit, and will back down. If they don't, sue the crap out of them.
