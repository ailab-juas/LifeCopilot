LPT: Pack a packet of instant oatmeal and/or powdered soup in your carry-on luggage.

content:
I have travelled extensively and have been in situations where getting food late at night in a strange place was difficult, but you can find hot water just about anywhere.
I use a small tools pouch from Husky to carry oatmeal, soup, and instant coffee. The oatmeal packets can tear open so the nylon pouch keeps everything protected. The shelf life of most of these items is fairly long, so it's okay if you forget it in a luggage pocket for a few months.
