YSK To compare your yearly "raise" to the inflation rate because you might be getting a pay decrease

content:
Why YSK: Obviously any raise is better than no raise but unless the raise percentage is greater than the inflation percentage you are actually taking a pay decrease or just breaking even.



Most hourly companies will give their employees around a 15-30 cent raise or something similar every year which is better than nothing. Unless this raise percentage is greater than the inflation percentage you are actually taking a pay decrease or breaking even. 

For example: in the US last year, the estimated inflation rate grew by 4.2% which means unless you got a raise of 4.2% of your income, you are making 4.2% less. 

For someone making $15 an hour, you would need a raise of 63 cents just to match the value of your pay last year. 

Companies know that most people don't look at inflation rates. This allows them to get away with "giving you a raise" to keep you around while actually paying you less.
