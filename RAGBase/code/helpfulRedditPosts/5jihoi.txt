LPT: overcome your fear of public speaking by going in with a "I'm doing this for the experience" mindset

content:
When we are nervous, we tend to speak quickly, and are more likely to come across as nervous and rushed and wanting to get it over and done with. To come across calm, collected and smooth (as possible) think about the experience you'll gain from presenting. Don't think about how you need to impress anybody or nail all the talking points or have the right length pauses at exactly the right moments. Take some of the pressure off yourself, and consider it another learning exercise. When you are done, any feedback you receive is easier to take on board and add into your toolkit to improve for next time.
