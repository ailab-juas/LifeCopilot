Lpt: pack a towel

content:
Lets not dive straight into certain memes, towels arent usable for everything, they make for a terible sail for a raft...

However, When you pack a bag for a trip in the summer bring a towel of a decent size, and keep it close to hand.

Use it as a pillow or roll as a neck support for a Long busride etc.


Of course, it is a towel, so it can dry yourself if needed, both if you get sweaty or rained on.


Put it over your head and neck to shade you from the sun (seriously a towel over your head and fastened in your backpack shoulders Will feel like 5 degrees less!), Larger towel can cover arms too, and still hands free, unlike using an unbrella.



Wet the towel to wash yourself or simply cool you down.


Roll a moist towel around a bottle and leave it in the sun, and the bottle Will cool a bit.


Use as a blanket to sit on, or as a bit more warmth if the night gets too cold.

The options are not endless, but plenty enough to carry the extra weight
