LPT - Have your computer load faster by adjusting what's in the startup file.

content:
Realized a lot of junk was loading when I start my computer.  Mainly, I got over using f.lux and didn't want it to run at startup.


Got inspiration from [this site](http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1401-startup-programs-change.html), though I have no vested interest in it.


Got to your Start buttone -&gt; type 'system configuratio -&gt; click what pops up under 'Programs' -&gt; then there's a 'startup' tab you can open and see what runs when you start Windows.


I have no idea what to do for OS X :-/
