LPT: Even if you carry enough water with you on a hike, bring and leave an extra supply in the car. It saves weight and guarantees you’ll have water if something happens on the trail.

I’ll throw a couple filled bottles or a gallon jug in my trunk before heading out for a hike or fieldwork. It’s an easy step that ensures you have hydration even if something goes wrong (leaks, sharing, losing your bottle down a hill, etc).
