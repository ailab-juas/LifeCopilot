title:
YSK: Most pizza places use the same pizza cutters regardless of what toppings are on them, so if you are unable to eat certain toppings due to health or religious reasons, you may need to request a fresh cutter for your pizza.

content:
Examples include pork toppings that Muslim or Jewish people are not allowed to eat or have mixed in their food

EDIT: I get it, some places won’t honor this request and food service is trash, doesn’t mean it’s not useful information to know

Requesting the pizza to not get cut at all is also a very viable option that ideally satisfies everyone involved

EDIT 2: Copy/pasting this response to some backlash I’m receiving: 

In all honesty I didn’t think this would be such a controversial thread, I didn’t think the concept of either not cutting a pizza or taking 10 seconds to grab a new cutter from the back to accommodate one or two special case customers per day would be such a rough concept for Reddit to understand. Some of ya’ll are growing neck beards in real time.

Fuck me for putting in mild effort to respect people who are different for me right?
