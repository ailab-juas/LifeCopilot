title:
LPT: Never, ever lie to Your anesthesiologist

content:
If You lie about things like height, weight, drug use, smoking, when You last ate, pain medications etc. that could easily kill You or give You a very unpleasent experience.
Also, anesthesiologists don't care how much You weigh or if You smoke weed, they just want to give You the best possible care.
