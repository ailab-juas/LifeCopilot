title:
YSK that offering help to a disabled person is OK, but No is a full and valid answer.

Why YSK: this is going to be most important in Customer Service based jobs but you may encounter this in many other places. An offer of help is a question, no is a full and valid answer, and forcing your help is not longer helping it is harming.


What do I mean?

If a disabled person looks like they might need assistance, it is good to ask them. But if their answer is "no I do not need help" you need to accept this and step back. The disabled person knows their abilities and their needs. If they are out on their own, it is fair to assume they are capable of managing on their own. If they are not alone, then their carer or companion will be know their assistance needs and be there to provide them.


Why is it important?

There's lots of reasons why giving "help" without asking, or "helping" after your offer has been declined, is bad.
- It removes autonomy from the disabled person. We should have a right to choose.
- It also reduces independence. We have aids and appliances to get around and navigate life, but many of us still wish to do what we can when we can. 
- What you think is help may cause pain or distress to the disabled person. Like moving a mobility aid, physically touching someone, or generally forcing them to continue to interact with you.


Please understand and respect that someone might be visibly disabled (eg, a wheelchair user), but this does not mean they need to be treated like they are helpless. Treat the disabled person like you would any other. Offer help if they look like they need it but accept no as an answer. Talk to the disabled person first and not their companion or carer. Do not assume a disabled person is only waiting for someone and isn't actually a part of a queue in a business. 


Caveat: the only time this doesn't apply is if there is clear, imminent danger which would cause significant damage or harm.
