title:
LPT: when talking to a deaf person, maintain eye contact with said deaf person and NOT their interpreter

content:
Remember, you're having a conversation with that person, not their interpreter. So when you need to make eye contact during the conversation, look at the person you're talking to (the deaf person) even though they can't understand you. If you don't look at them when you're talking/don't look at them when they're responding to you, they might find it rude.
