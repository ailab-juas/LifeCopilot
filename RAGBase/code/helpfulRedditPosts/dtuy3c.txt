LPT: Never tell a coworker anything you wouldn't want your manager to hear no matter how much you trust them.

Edit: Thanks for all the silvers everyone! I got fired a few weeks ago because I told my coworker I was having trouble memorizing the alcohol we had at the store and for taking off for surgery (I'm assuming.) I'm having a hard time so it was nice to see everyone with the same problem. Hope y'all learn this lesson through me and not how I did lol.
