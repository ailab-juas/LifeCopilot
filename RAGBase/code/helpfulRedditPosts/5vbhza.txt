LPT: Next time you have an easily googleable question about food, clothes, or general life stuff, text your Mom and ask her instead. She probably loves seeing that you still want her advice.

This is something I've been doing lately just because I feel like my mom seems happier when I do. I'm in my last year of college and realized I typically just google'd all my questions that I had as I figure out living on my own. This past year though, I've been texting her all my silly little questions: "How can I get X stain out of my carpet easily?"  "Do you know any home-remedies for a sore throat?"

It might seem really trivial, but I think anyone would love to know that you still rely on them and not only appreciate their advice, but seek it out too. 

Have a great day! :)

EDIT: Obligatory thanks for the gold, kind stranger. Glad I could brighten your days!
