LPT: If you find yourself in an abusive relationship that is hard to extricate yourself from, get a storage unit.

content:
It doesn’t have to be large. You can pay in cash so as not to leave a trail. You can slowly transfer things of value to that space, because when your SO gets mad, the things you find precious will be the things they destroy first. You can also begin stashing things you need if you pull the “fuck this shit” rip cord, like clothes, toiletries, cash etc. because sometimes when you have to get out, you have to get out fast and leave everything. If times get real bad and you have to bail, you can go there. They are gated and video monitored and your SO will be looking for you at places that you would likely go, like friends or family. If the weather is harsh, you can duck out there for a few hours out of the elements “organizing” your unit.

Edit: I have seen such an outpouring of hope and great advice and experiences. We all learn from each others experience. I hope to continue that feeling of inclusion, that we are all in this together, until we can all find happiness.
