YSK: Minors Cannot Legally Enter Into A Contract And Therefore Can Return Products/Services For Full Price With No Repurcussions.

content:
Ex: Sharon is 17 and enters into a contract for a 12 month gym membership. 6 months in she decides she doesn't want to continue paying. As long as she is still under 18, she can void the contract. This can also be applied to products.

Contracts are only voidable by minors.
