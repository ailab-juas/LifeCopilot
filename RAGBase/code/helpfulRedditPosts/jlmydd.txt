LPT: If you want to write positive review for an employee that went out of their way to help you, don't give specifics in your review. They may have been bending policy and telling management may inadvertently get them reprimanded.

Especially places that have large corporate attachments (like hotels) make sure you just leave a generic "So and So really helped make my visit memorable and delivered great customer service." 

I stayed at a hotel once and arrived at like 1AM. At the time I stupidly thought all hotels in the chain accepted pets, not realizing each one had different policies. The front desk manager realized the situation and quietly told me she could be listed as a service animal but that hotel policy was to see documentation proof. He said if I left before the morning manager arrived he would look the other way (my dog is clearly not a service animal).

I asked him if a nice review would help and he eagerly said yes, but reiterated that I should not say anything about the dog as the hotel managers took it really serious. He made the comment "some people think they're being nice but they get us in trouble by divulging too many details."
