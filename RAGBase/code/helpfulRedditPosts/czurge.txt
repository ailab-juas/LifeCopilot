title:
YSK that many wheelchair and electric cart users can walk, but struggle with an invisible disability. Don’t be rude and call them out.

Yes, this includes large people. While it may be funny to point out how their butt engulfs the seat, they may have a genuine medical issue unrelated to their weight. 

These people aren’t being lazy or fooling around. Caring for oneself with a disability is hard enough, they don’t need you to ask a million questions or criticize them in the store. Most stores have multiple electric carts available. There aren’t (non safety) rules to use them besides not being an idiot/ramming things/things that go without saying. 

Ambulatory wheelchair users exist as well. So if you see someone standing up to pack their chair into the car, please refrain from comments like “it’s a miracle!” or worse, call them a faker. 

Invisible disabilities that make walking very difficult are countless but some include chronic pain, nervous system disorders resulting in severe dizziness (I.e. forms of dysautonomia), heart conditions, and recent surgeries.
