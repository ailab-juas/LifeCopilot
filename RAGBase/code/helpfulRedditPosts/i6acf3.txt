LPT: Download digital user manuals as soon as you buy anything, and store them on some sort of cloud storage account.

This is something I've been doing for years and years.

Any time I buy anything, the first thing I do is I go online and download the digital user manual. 99% of the time it's just a small PDF file.

Then I rename the PDF to something easily searchable, and then I save it to my cloud storage account. At the moment I'm using OneDrive.

Saving it to cloud storage is a huge help because you can pull it up on your phone quickly.

For example...

This is what triggered this post... Just now, I realized a digital clock I have on the wall hasn't been auto updating for daylight savings time changes. It's supposed to be one of those atomic clocks that just updates on its own.

The manufacturer no longer makes this clock, and the user manual is no longer on their site, and it's impossible to find anywhere online. However, when I bought the clock, I emailed their support email and asked if they had it. They were more than happy to send it to me.

So now, I was able to open the PDF on my phone, look through it and I figured out how to reset the clock, and force it to perform a manual wireless sync. It's now syncing again and back on the wall.
