LPT: Don't let your fear of looking stupid hold you back from doing things you're interested in or curious about. Learning to not care about being judged or looked at as stupid is a valuable life trait.

You have one chance of life, there's no reason to be scared of living the life you want just because you don't want to judged or looked at as stupid. I like to think about it like this:

In 200 years when everyone you know or have ever met is gone no one is going to remember or care about that time you went to a movie theater alone. No one is going to judge or care that you asked that one person out. No one is going to care about that time you tried out that new haircut or a new style of clothes. The only person those events are going to affect is you. So do what you want. You have what 70 something years on Earth, maybe less or maybe more. There's no reason to be scared of doing things just because of what other people might think. It's useless to care about other people's opinions. Because those opinions of others are just random thoughts in a brain. They don't do anything. They don't affect you.

If a happy life for you involves reaching out into your curiosity and doing things you enjoy or want to enjoy  then do it. Having a happy and enjoyable life while being judged is better than living a miserable life just because you're too scared or nervous to be happy.
