LPT: Keep olive oil in the shower

content:
I always keep a bottle of Costco-sized olive oil in the shower. It is a great skin moisturizer, and if you have run out of face wash, olive oil does a better trick than any of them. For both uses, you only need maybe half a capful to oil your body with, and less than a few drops to wash your face, which means you're going to be far more economical than if you were buying individual products.

Also, if you decide to have a bath, pour in a capful and walk out with the silkiest skin imaginable. Bonus: you learn what it's like to be spaghetti.

Final use, if you have a safety razor (one with a removable razor blade), olive oil makes fantastic shaving oil and gets you a really close, smooth shave. 

Best part of this all? Olive oil is cheaper and goes a lot farther than buying all those bath products combined.

Edit: I used the word face wash when I really meant makeup remover. I forget that everyone isn't a girl sometimes.
