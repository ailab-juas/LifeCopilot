LPT When you move out of a place where you had roommates, make sure you aren't on any of the paperwork for bills after you leave

content:
My ex roommates kept using internet without paying the bill, so I ended up having to pay 300 bucks 9 months later to get it off my credit when I found out about it. People will screw you over, so don't trust them. Also please don't post saying you feel sorry for me, shit happens and I messed up by trusting them.
