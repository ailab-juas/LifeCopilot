LPT: The amazing uses of Baking Soda and other natural/cheap house cleaning tips!

content:
Baking soda is something that we tend to forget about when there are all of these fancy cleaning products out there.  But holy cow, you really don't need them.  Here are some uses for baking soda, and some other home tips, if you can suggest more, add to the list!

* Black Head remover: Rinse face with warm/hot water, then apply a thick paste of baking soda and water to the entire face or afflicted areas. (I suggest doing a test spot for safety!)  Leave the baking soda on for 3-4 minutes, don't leave it on for any longer because it doesn't need it and you don't want to damage your skin. Rinse with warm water, then for an extra toner, mix apple cider vinegar and water, then wipe your face with a cloth dipped in that.  Finally rinse your face with cool water.

* Grout &amp; Mold Cleaner: Apply a tick paste of baking soda and water to your grout and afflicted mold areas (sink, grout, toilet, shower, etc) and let sit for 2-3 hours. Come back and rinse off. I've found this to be more effective than bleach.

* Stove-top &amp; Oven cleaner: Apply a thick paste of baking soda to the caked on food and burnt stuffs on your stove.  Let sit for 2-3 hours, and come back and wipe away, boom, like new. 

* Homemade furniture polish: Mix Vinegar, Oil and Fresh lemon in a dish, and apply to wooden furniture. Is just as effective as expensive polish and doesn't cost anywhere near as much

* Homemade all-purpose cleaner: White Vinegar, Water, and Fresh Lemon.  Wash everything and this will clean it.  Also good on glass, and you can use newspaper to dry glass as it leaves a streak-free dry.

* You *can* mix baking soda into your toothpaste to help with teeth whitening, but be careful as this isn't the best for your gums, especially for prolonged use.

* Put a touch of baking soda into your bath water to help relieve skin irritations.

* Sprinkle baking soda into cat litter to soak up odor
