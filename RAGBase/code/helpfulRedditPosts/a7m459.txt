YSK: If youâ€™re going to visit someone in the hospital, bring them an extension cord and earplugs. The former lets them use their devices in bed while plugged in, and their visitors can juice up as they hang out. The latter helps drown out hospital noises and helps them sleep.

Edit: To clarify, this is in leu of or in addition to flowers. The cord should be brand new in the packaging as should the earplugs. Don't give anyone used earplugs. That's gross.
