LPT: Everyone's time is valuable. Start &amp; end meetings on time. Important people are late? Start with other topics. Meeting runs overtime? Tell people at the scheduled end time they can leave. If you'll be late, tell someone; if you need to leave on time, let them know beforehand.

Value other people's time and protect your own.

Really, the only unusual thing here is to have a policy where you schedule meetings but, if they run over, allow people to leave if they want to. When I run meetings, I let people know when there are 10 and then 5 minutes left, and strongly encourage people to be efficient so we end on time. If we go over, I stop the meeting and let people leave so they don't feel like they are just walking out or that I'll be sore at them. Then I continue with those who can or want to remain.

People tend to respect your time more if you show you value your own time. When you go into a meeting, you can ask about how long it will take. If they say, "about an hour," then you can say, "good, I have one hour, but then I need to leave."  If there is a topic you need the meeting to get around to before you can leave, you can politely mention a bit more than halfway through that you will need to leave in X amount of time, so if they could get to your topic, it would be good.
