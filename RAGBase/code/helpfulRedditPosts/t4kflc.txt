LPT: Before leaving an Airbnb or vacation rental, do a video walkthrough of how you're leaving the unit to avoid being scammed!

content:
I recently stayed at an Airbnb and the host tried to claim I left a mess and destroyed furniture. They filed a complaint with Airbnb about it and tried to milk me out of money. Jokes on them because I took a video of the unit before I left and was quickly absolved of any wrong doing. Do it! People are scumbags! Save yourself the hassle!

edit: so many people are saying "well what if you made a video and then trashed it right after?!" remember, the burden of proof lies with the accuser. if they make a claim, they have to be able to prove it. make the video, time stamp it, and you're all set.
