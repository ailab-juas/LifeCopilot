LPT: Open chip bags upside down. They've been sitting upright most of their lives which makes the seasoning settle to the bottom of the bag.

Edit: Hey, thanks for the silver and gold whoever did that! I'm definitely pleasantly surprised this blew up like it did. Never knew that chip bag opening could be such a hot topic.

Aside from the seasoning (yeah, agreed that this only really happens with some chip types), the bigger part of this for me is that the little crunched up pieces fall into the big chips, so you get big chips that are topped with tiny more seasoned chips throughout the bag.

Also agree from a health standpoint, the better LPT is probably to eat fewer chips :-P But nothing wrong with treating yourself every now and then.

Thanks again folks! Fun way to end the weekend :)
