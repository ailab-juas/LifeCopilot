YSK that 11 American States have laws that ban companies from passing on credit card fees to the customer

content:
Why YSK:  You may live in a State that prohibits this and you can enforce your rights.   Here are the 11 States: —California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas—and the Territory of Puerto Rico.   EDIT:  You may report violations to your State's Attorney General Office.  Some Redditors are reporting that certain states may have modified their laws.  Check with your State's Division of Consumer Affairs.
