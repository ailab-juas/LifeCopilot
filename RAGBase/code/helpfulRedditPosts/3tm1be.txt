LPT: When something terrible happens and you can't fathom living through it or feel so isolated, fight the urge to remain alone and go help others (volunteer).

content:
Going to volunteer and help other people is not a way to feel better than those who are currently down on their luck, but rather a way to realize you aren't alone in life struggles.  Isolating could perpetuate your feelings in a dangerous way. No one is alone in going through hardships; find a way to relate to others and get support.

Just found out my father has had cancer for 4 months and found out through the most shitty way. He almost got in a bar fight, spilled his guts to the man, and the man said tell her or I will. For those struggling with difficult situations, I am truly sorry and wish you the best trying to sort out the next chapter in your life.
