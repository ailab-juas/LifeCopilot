LPT: Do not use the app door dash to order food. Go to the restaurant‚Äôs website and click deliver. It will still be delivered by door dash but for significantly cheaper.

I found this out by accident. I ordered Noodles and Co and am feeling too sick to drive so I clicked deliver after ordering through their website. After about 40 mins, I was notified by text that ‚ÄúConnie‚Äù from Door Dash delivered my food. Guess what? No food was delivered. 

I called customer service and my issue was escalated and come to find out, the Door Dash driver ‚ÄúConnie‚Äù never came to the restaurant to pick up my food in the first place. She was also unavailable by phone. 

 So I got a full refund from Noodles and Co but it was facilitated by Door Dash. 

Obviously I‚Äôm still hungry. So I downloaded the door dash app and ordered the EXACT same meal and it was $10 more!! I‚Äôm a first time user and got a $2.99 delivery fee waver and it‚Äôs MORE money for the EXACT same order? How is this possible?

Here is the answer‚Ä¶

They raise the price of each food item in the Door Dash app for the exact same food you can buy on the restaurant‚Äôs website and get delivered by the same company DOOR DASH. This is even with the delivery fee included. 

LPT: Order your food to be delivered through the restaurant‚Äôs website to save significant money üí∞
