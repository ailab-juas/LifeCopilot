LPT: If you see a deer crossing the road, assume other deer may immediately follow and drive with caution

content:
This morning, I saw a deer crossing the road about a block in front of me ahead of two other cars.  This was on Atlas road, a 2 lane road with decent sized shoulders and plenty of cleared space with forest on both sides of the road not far from downtown Columbia, SC.

Both cars slowed down, then after the deer passed in front of the first car, both cars immediately sped up again.  I saw another deer come jogging out of the woods, right into the path of the second car, which, still accelerating, struck the deer with the front right side panel in front of the tire.  The guy driving the car immediately pulled over to inspect the damage, while the deer managed to hop back into the woods.

I saw the second deer coming the whole time, because I had learned this lesson the hard way with a train of raccoons.  For some reason, when the lead animal makes the decision to cross, the others just seem to blindly follow.

Not all animals are loners, people!
