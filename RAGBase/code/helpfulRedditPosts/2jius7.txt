title:
LPT: Before you send a text, read it aloud to yourself in a monotone voice with no inflection. That is how your recipient will read it, and you can tell if the tone of the text is too harsh or soft.

content:
So many times we send a text with a joke or sarcasm, and the recipient does not get the joke or the sarcasm is lost. If you read it aloud to yourself in a monotone voice, you can pick up the parts that may be a little ambiguous. Make changes as needed. 

This just may save your marriage or your job. 


** Edit - Okay, when I say read aloud to yourself in a monotone voice, it is to remove YOUR OWN voice from the tone of the text. Everyone will read in their own way, obviously. The point is that you do not know HOW that person will read it, so it is best to remove all ambiguity prior to sending.
