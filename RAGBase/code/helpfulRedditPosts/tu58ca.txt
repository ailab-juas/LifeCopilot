LPT: Any time you sell something locally online, insist to meet up at a Police Station parking lot

content:
My dad sells expensive things online in the local Cleveland, OH area. So many times people have been robbed for higher end items like phones and sneakers. He always insists on making the transaction in a local PD parking lot and has had a lot of sales canceled over this, every time he says he “dodged a bullet”.
