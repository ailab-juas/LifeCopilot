LPT: If you're using Zoom for work or school, be aware that Zoom has an attention tracking feature.

content:
Update 4/18/2020: just in case people arenâ€™t reading the comments, a bunch of people have commented to say Zoom seems to have removed the attention tracking feature! 

Basically, Zoom has a function that allows the leader of the meeting to be notified when a participant's Zoom window is closed/inactive for 30+ seconds.
