LPT: Train your children to write a Thank-You letter before they cash a check or spend money given as a gift.

content:
I  have always made my son do this, and it is now almost automatic for him. If he gets a monetary gift for Christmas or birthday, he gets a card out in th email right away.  Edit: Ok, this was unexpected. Yes, teach is a better choice of words. I should have mentioned that this is in situations where a face to face thank you is not possible - my son just recieved a card and check from 800 miles away. I think him sending a card is appropriate.
