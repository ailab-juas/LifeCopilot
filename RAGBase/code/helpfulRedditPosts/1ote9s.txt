LPT: Duplicate your last slide when doing a presentation

content:
If you're giving a presentation and using PowerPoint, make a duplicate of your final slide. 

Many people accidentally click on their last slide, which ends the slideshow and takes it out of full-screen mode. By adding a duplicate final slide, if you click on your last slide, the slideshow remains full-screen and doesn't close out (because it is showing the duplicate).
