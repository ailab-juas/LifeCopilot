title:
YSK that companies like Teleflora, FTD, and 1-800-Flowers don't actually have physical stores. They're just middle-men who take orders, charge you a 20% service fee, and then turn around and charge the local floral shop a finder's fee. So shop local and keep your money in your flowers.

content:
They also display their flowers on their websites as "one sided" arrangements, so they look much smaller once you receive them.
