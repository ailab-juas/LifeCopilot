LPT: When checking the air pressure in your tires, don't forget to check your spare!

content:
I just checked the air pressure in my tires before traveling.  I also checked the spare...only to find it completely flat.  I refilled it and put it back in the boot.   

A flat spare isn't helpful!  Be sure your spare has air!

Travel safely!
