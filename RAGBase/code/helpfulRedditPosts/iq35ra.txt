LPT : If you are hiking / running / walking with someone in a worse shape than you, let them lead the way.

I know this might not be the greatest life tip of all but this is something I realized over the last couple of days. By simply being there, these friends are motivated to get back in shape and make an effort. Going first and imposing a strong rhythm will make them feel terrible about their stamina or global physical aptitudes and have a deterrent effect that might stop them from coming again. Stay behind, walk at their pace, pause when they do and humor them if they feel tired. Acknowledge the difficulty of the effort (donâ€™t overdo it). I feel like this can go a long way in keeping them motivated to work out and improve their overall stamina and physical shape.

Edit : thanks to all for the support, awards, personal stories and debates !
