YSK what to do if your house is on fire.

In the recent [WTF post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1qae3s/this_just_happened/) OP was able to extinguish the fire because it was slow to grow. He got lucky and I would never advise entering a structure in an attempt to extinguish the fire. That fire never really intensified given the time it had to grow, but if it did the outcome could have been deadly.

After seeing some of the comments, I wanted to write this post hoping to get people to think about fire safety.

First thing's first, have working [smoke detectors](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/where-to-install-a-smoke-detector.html) and  [a plan.](http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/escape-planning)

Get out and stay out. [Call 911](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-911) or [your countries emergency phone number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number#Emergency_numbers) immediately from the front lawn with a cell phone or from a neighbors house. The link says to preferably use a landline, but if you are confident in your cell service, in this day and age, the cell phone will be quicker therefore better. Stay calm. The first question they will ask is address, so be ready to listen to them and answer every question. 

Stay by the mailbox, or the edge of your driveway so you can tell the first arriving fire department officer vital information like if there are people trapped, pets inside, or if there are any hazardous conditions inside (propane or oxygen tanks, fire arm ammo, or if you were renovating and there are holes in floors/walls ect.)

DO NOT GO BACK INSIDE! [A fire intensifies incredibly quickly,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKel2MdPn58) some sources say it doubles in size every 30 seconds, others every 5 minutes, the important thing is in the time it took you to exit your house and call the FD, that fire is significantly larger, hotter, and the smoke it has produced will kill you. 

I have seen fires kill people because they went in thinking they can fight it. If you attempt to go back in, you will be met with thick black smoke that is not only toxic, it may be super heated and burn your lungs if inhaled. Even if you stay low and out of the smoke, you will immediately regret your decision once you get closer to the fire. The heat experienced is incredible and will burn and kill you if the room is close to flashover. 

If on the way out you come across the fire and it is small and you have a way to fight it that doesn’t require you to pass an exit, you can try one quick attempt at putting it out. 

So an example would be, on the way to the front door, you can clearly see it is a small fire on your stove, or the garbage can is on fire AND you have an extinguisher that is right there, give it a go. Tell everyone to get out and stay out and have them call the FD.

[Know how to use a fire extinguisher and use the PASS technique.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLjoWjCrDqg) Pull Aim Squeeze Sweep. Pull the pin. Aim for the seat of the fire, Squeeze the handle and let her rip Sweeping the area being sure you got the whole fire. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT YOURSELF BETWEEN THE FIRE AND THE EXIT! 

You get one chance, if the fire doesn’t go out, get out and stay out. Don’t run to the basement or garage for another fire extinguisher, by the time you get back the fire will be larger and out of control. 

If it is a cooking fire, do not put water on it or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T77rYn-yAe0) can happen.

A fire is a helpless feeling.You will watch light smoke turn to dark smoke as you listen to windows begin to break and fire start to pour out of the openings. You can hear the sirens for miles and it seams like an eternity before the FD gets there. But you must remain outside. 

Some other things that will make the FD's job easier is getting cars away from the front of your house. That will give the FD a nice open space to work with. 

It has been mentioned in the comments that having a fire proof safe to keep important hard to replace documents in. Passports, birth certificates, S.S cards, important family items ect. I have a small $20 one like [this one.](http://www.google.com/shopping/product/14140207449049498638?q=fireproof+safe&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.56146854,d.dmg,pv.xjs.s.en_US.zw3S-PWncBk.O&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=702&amp;tch=1&amp;ech=1&amp;psi=qfOAUrO0K7Sn4AOc9oD4BA.1384182698988.3&amp;ei=sfOAUofuGe_F4AP36ICYDQ&amp;ved=0CNEBEKYrMAM) They make larger ones to hold bigger items like photo albums and such, but the majority of my pictures are backed up on a computer.

Also if the house is safe to approach, unlock all the doors to the house DO NOT OPEN THEM. Just unlock them. Opening the doors will give the fire more O2 causing it to intensify and spread.

Also make sure the fire hydrant on your street isn’t obstructed in anyway. 

Now let me be clear, garden hoses are not to be used to fight a house fire. Typical garden hoses flow 10 gallons per minute of water (GPM) where a fire department’s hand line will flow anywhere from 150-300 GPM. However, if your house is close to a neighbors house, and the fire is blowing out the windows, from a safe distance, you can try to spray the house with water to stop the fire from spreading to the neighbors house. This is called protecting the exposure. The only way I’d advise this is if it is done from a safe distance, and the neighbor has already evacuated their home. 
It has been pointed out by u/shaggorama how dangerous this could be. There are many factors to take into account that he/she has mentioned. The house could collapse, stuff could fall from above, the electrical service to the home could come down energizing fences, many others. The reason I bring up the garden hose is I have seen first homeowners and would-be rescuers attempting to fight fires with them. It is EXTREMELY dangerous and should not be attempted. 

tl;dr- Get out, stay out, call the fire department.

Hope that helps, feel free to ask any questions in the comments.
