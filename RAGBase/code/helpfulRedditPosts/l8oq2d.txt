LPT: When you buy a house, be sure to save pictures of the interior design before the sale is over. You can recreate the “staging” that the realtors paid for to make the house look cozy.

Houses are often professionally “staged”, meaning a company will come in and make the house look as cozy and livable as possible using rented props. None of it will be there when you buy the house, but you can recreate the look from the pictures and get free interior design designed to maximize the house’s appeal.
