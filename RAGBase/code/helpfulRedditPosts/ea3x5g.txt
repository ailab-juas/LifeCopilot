YSK: in the US more people died from the flu in 2018 than from opiates during the worst year of the "opiate epidemic" (2017). Go get your flu shot.

content:
In 2018 the us had 80,000 deaths as a result of flu complications while the during the worst year of the opiate epidemic (2017 so far) deaths from opiate overdose were just over 70,000. Additionally, on top of deaths there were hundreds of thousands of hospital visits, millions in economic losses as a result of the flu. Furthermore this was even the worst flu recorded in history(50 million deaths from the 1918 flu world wide).
So go out and get your vaccine, it's not too late and it could save your or prevent you from spreading it to children and elderly (most at risk).

Also I want to point out that I am not trying to play down the opiate epidemic, these are both serious problems, I just used it to highlight how important the flu is as most people acknowledge the opiate epidemic but ignore the yearly flu epidemic. Also, of you are struggling with opiates please seek help it's not too late, here is a link that can assist you.  https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline



Lastly for those interested in learning more about vaccination here is a link to the podcast "this week in virology"  on which a panel of R1 researchers address and debunk many of the common antivax myths. It's a tad long but VERY informative, and interesting. Plus it would be hard to find a better source of info on the topic that's easily accessible

Also before the antivaxer begin attacking, I challenge you to find one thing factually in accurate in podcast episode. If you can prove, with valid sources, that the professors have said something wrong I will remove this post.

Edit: the reason "opiate epidemic" is in quotations is because the definition of an epidemic is "a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time". Opiates are not infectious and do not properly fit the description hence the quotes. I gave resources to help people and clarified that I am not down playing the seriousness of the problem.

Edit2:   The amount of pseudo science being promoted in this thread is absurd. Just to clarify every one is suceptible the flu, unless you have memory to the virus and because of frequent mutations this only last for about a year. Also yes OBVIOUSLY the elderly are more at risk then the general public but young children and occasionally perfectly healthy adults can have very intense reactions. Also for the people who won't die from the flu(or are unlikely to) there are many many other negative impacts, such as loss of work hospitalization and just feeling like shit for a long period of time. ALSO the flu shot CANNOT give you the flu. True it's not always the most effective but even when it's not very effective it can shorten how long you are sick , decrease the symptoms, and you will produce less viral particles.
