Sometimes the teacher will accidentally suggest the right answer 

Edit: Did not think this post would make it this far! There have been a lot of comments saying to just study. I didn't mean to solely rely on this for a test. Studying hard is definitely the correct way to do it, but picking up little hints can definitely help you more than hurt you! Happy midterms week everybody!
