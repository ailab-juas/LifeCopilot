LPT: Try to Calibrate your Monitor

content:
For a long time I thought that my monitor's colors and contrast where bad due to it being relative cheap. But, after calibrating it with the windows built in tool, I saw a huge improvement from before. Might not be a great solution for everyone especially those with more expensive monitors, but it takes 2 minutes and can improve your viewing experience by a lot!
