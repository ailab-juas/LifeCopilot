title:
LPT: take a photo of your wife/mother of your child/mother during special days and moments. Most of the time they are the ones taking all of the photos.

content:
And when you look back at their little memory collage of photos itâ€™s with everyone in it except her. Extra life pro tip: it might make her feel important and pretty too.

**I cannot change the title but this goes for any person of gender. Not just women.**
