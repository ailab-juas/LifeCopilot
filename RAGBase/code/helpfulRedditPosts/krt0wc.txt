LPT: Look at yourself as if you are your own child. Do what you want your child to do in daily life. This will drastically improve the self-discipline in your life.

I have been trying this lately. Wherein, whenever I feel like slacking off, I just look at myself as my own kid and start ordering myself like I'm my parent. 

Since I would always want good for my child, it's always going to be the right decision for me thus it feels easier to do stuff I'm not interested in. 

I also call myself with my name while commanding. This makes it much easier to imagine the scenario.
