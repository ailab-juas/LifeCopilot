title:
LPT: Delay your outgoing work email by 1 min

content:
There's been a few times I've sent out work emails on outlook and forgot to proof or attach a document before I jumped the gun and clicked send. That way you prevent any slip ups if you accidentally hit reply all or whatever.

*Edit more detailed steps from u/spankr:*

* Click "Rules" dropdown on the tool "ribbon"

* Select "Manage Rules &amp; Alerts"

* Click "New Rule..."

* Highlight "Apply rule on messages I send"

* Click "Next"

* Click "Next" again

* Click "OK" to the dialogue warning you that this rule will apply to every message you send

* Check "Defer delivery by a number of minutes"

* In the lower area, click the "a number of" link and set it to whatever you like

* Click "OK"

* Click "Finish"

*edit: I've gotten at least 50 "Don't put the recipient's address in until the email is done". 
Yes I get this is an option but the delay works as a quick auto safety net
