LPT: Don't say stupid shit while on "hold".

content:
My wife works at a call center for a big name appliance company.  They have a policy that customers cannot be put on hold for more than 5 minutes without a good explanation.  To get around this, the operators will often mute their microphone.  With this, you canâ€™t hear them but they can hear you.  It's amazing what people say when they think no one is listening.  Many customers self-incriminate during this time.  It's all recorded and often used against the customer.  If you don't hear music, the mike is definitely muted.
