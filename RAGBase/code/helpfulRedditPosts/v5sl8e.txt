LPT to remember peoples birthdays

content:
Every time someone mentions their birthday in casual conversation, I stop and put it on the calendar in my phone. I also set the reminder to go off two weeks before and the day before. And I have the reminder repeat every year. 

Two weeks before: Hey, your birthday is coming up soon, any plans?
This is also the time to go ahead and order a gift if they are a good friend

Day before: Happy Birthday tomorrow!

I’ve been using this method for about a year and it works amazing. Friends and colleagues are always impressed that I remember their birthdays. Even if you don’t get them gifts, it’s nice to have someone remember your birthday.
