LPT: If you charge your service by the hour (such as private teacher), overcompensate your client whenever you're late . Don't just "refund" them the exact amount of time their service was delayed.

Teacher here. Whenever I'm late, I add to their lesson twice the time it was delayed. This way, they'll actually feel compensated, not just that they got what they paid for, but with some delay. It also shows you care, are generous and, most important of all, that being late is not something you can just do at their expense whenever it's convenient. Overcompensating them makes it clear that any delays also have a cost to you. Cost they will benefit from.
