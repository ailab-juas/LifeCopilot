LPT: If you really need some peace and quiet but seem to be unable to find it, go to your local library.

content:
I am amazed every time I come into the library at how calm it is in here. Granted, of course it's supposed to be, but I'm realizing when I would go to Starbucks for "me" time I was being attacked with constant noise from the baristas to various customers. At the library, you can safely enjoy how quiet it is without the use of headphones.

Edit: This is a subjective post apparently. I did not know most people had loud libraries. I truly feel for y'all and wish you could enjoy the solace of my library.

Edit 2: This blew up more than I thought. Apparently many libraries are shit and I was not aware of that! And "local library" includes your local university library, which seems to be the most quiet bet.

Edit 3: Quotations over the word "me".
