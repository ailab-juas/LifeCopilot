[A video is circulating](https://dms.licdn.com/playback/C4D05AQHMjatldgTpHw/0a0e675460304af9b4d3af34e91f0ec6/feedshare-mp4_3300-captions-thumbnails/1507940147251-drlcss?e=1551981600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=WgM9gRT0pzNqJKrHgMJhz4ctdo1RI5Kql07akT-3RuM) of a fit, 20-year-old woman in a gym who suddenly collapses with a heart attack. As you see in the video, there were automatic defibrillators at the gym, and they saved her life. The young woman continued on to campaign for awareness of these, as well as training.

[Heart attacks and cardiac arrests](https://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/AboutCPRFirstAid/CardiacArrestvsHeartAttack/UCM_473213_Cardiac-Arrest-vs-Heart-Attack.jsp) are not just a middle-age problem; accident or injury can sneak up on anyone. You could save the life of a stranger, or a loved one, but not unless you know what to do, what not to do, and what signs to look for. The automatic defibrillator is an example of an easy-to-use device that increases the odds of survival, along with some basic CPR knowledge.

It is also just one of many useful, easy-to-learn, and life-saving tips that you can get from attending even [a basic Red Cross or other first aid training course](https://www.google.com/search?q=red+cross+first+aid+course&amp;oq=red+cross+first+aid+course). And remember, when an incident occurs, always specifically task somebody to call the emergency services.

It's never too late to learn.
