LPT: Entrusted with the camera on vacation? Almost ALWAYS try to include a person you care about in every shot. Pictures of random landscapes/signs/animals at the zoo will be 99% be deleted in the future

This is a lesson my father tried to teach me young, but I didn't listen - and I'm paying the price now.

As a young person, I was always interested in taking "artsy" shots of random signs, filming random juggling acts on the sidewalk, etc. when we were on vacation. He said that in the future, I won't care about the pictures of random things (that there are thousands of higher-quality versions online of) - I'll care about pictures of my family and friends I love. Now that I'm older, he couldn't be more right. I have SO many pictures of random birds, 20 pictures of sky + water of me trying to get the "perfect shot" with my dinky phone camera... and I am deleting them all. Pictures of my family eating ice cream, or posing, or laughing? Those are the ones I care about. While I loved to take pictures and try to find good shots (and don't prevent yourself from having SOME fun with pictures), and I don't think EVERY shot you ever take needs to follow this creed, please learn the lesson I didn't and save your future self some headache.
