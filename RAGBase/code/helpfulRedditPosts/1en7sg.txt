LPT: if you have something in your eye, fill a kitchen bowl big enough for your face with lukewarm water and open your eyes in it. Whatever it is will come right out without having to touch (and possibly damage) your eye.

I've used this trick for years, which is **especially helpful if you don't have another person around to help find &amp; remove something in your eye.** I'm posting this today because I just had to use it. I was rushing out the door last night and suddenly my left eye was hurting when I blinked. I knew instantly what had happened: when I trimmed my goatee, one of those little bits of hair had popped up into it. 

The irritation came and went last night, but when I got up today and still felt it, I knew which remedy was needed. 

I have large glass bowl I've used for this before and soon it was half filled (don't fill the bowl up or the water your face displaces will soak wherever you decide to do this. If you are someone who has trouble keeping your eyes open underwater, this is actually a plus: the blinking will help dislodge this particular mote in your eye. 

Sure enough, when I looked in the bottom of the bowl, there was the tiny bit of beard that had been bugging me. 



EDIT: further tip - be sure the bowl is clean by washing it out. Even in cabinets they tend to gather dust, especially the big ones only used once a year to make holiday cookies and the like.
