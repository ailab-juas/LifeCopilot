LPT: When taking your child to Disney World or any other theme park, write your contact information on their wrist and cover it with liquid bandaid. If they are lost another person will have a way to contact you and the liquid bandaid will prevent it from rubbing off.

I've been going to theme for nearly every summer of my life and have been reading up on ways to improve the experience. Some other suggestions: 

Save your favorite rides (or ones with the longest lines) for the fireworks. Chances are the line will be shorter then and you'll be able to watch the fireworks from the ride. 

Eat local before or after you leave the park. Have a semi-filling breakfast, a snack for lunch, and gorge on some local food after the park closes. [For Orlando in particular, get out there and try some alligator.](http://www.reserveorlando.com/travelguide/top-spots-to-find-exotic-eats-orlando/) Also this guide tells you where to find Dole Whip. Go find Dole Whip. Trust me. 

Walk the park backwards if you're there when it opens. This works for most parks, but you'll be able to tell where the majority of the flow of visitors is heading. Go opposite of that and find shorter lines.
