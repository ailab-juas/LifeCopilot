LPT: Rough morning? Pay for the person behind you in line at the coffee shop. It will make your day along with theirs.

content:
Someone did it to me at subway and it made me so surprisingly happy so I did it for someone else and I felt just as warm and tingly. Totally worth this feeling for ~$5!

EDIT: Whoa, this sparked some controversy. I stand by it though. I felt great doing it. 

EDIT 2: Juuust to clarify it was at a Tim Horton's so the coffee is in your hand  already by the time the next person is ordering. I tapped the card, said have a good day, and left. No awkward 5-minute limbo period in between waiting for your drinks. (You're welcome Tim Horton's I'll take that endorsement check.)
