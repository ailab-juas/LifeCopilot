title:
YSK that "touching a baby bird will make it so that the mother won't take it back" is a myth.

content:
Why YSK : Birds have a limited sense of smell, so if it's on the grass, it's better you move it so no one steps on it. Better a moved bird, even if the mother will look for it a bit, than a crushed bird under the foot of uncaring humans. The mama bird won't smell you on the baby and so it won't abandon it because of that. Also, to hide it from cats, for a while at least. In other words, you can save its life by moving it.

EDIT 2: To be clear, I'm not talking about nests, just a baby lying on the ground. Don't tamper with nests. Again, it's not the smell, but birds don't like predators touching their nests, and in places it's even illegal.
