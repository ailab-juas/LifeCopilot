title:
LPT: For those without home security alarms...if you have a car with a keyless entry remote, leave it next to your bed. If someone tries to break into your house, press the panic button. Your car's alarm will go off, which will draw attention to your house or scare whoever is trying to break in.

Poor man's home security system. 

EDIT: Yes, guns work better. Not everyone can get them though.

EDIT2: It's true that no one cares about car alarms, but it will likely startle whoever is breaking in, and people generally hate loud car alarms.
