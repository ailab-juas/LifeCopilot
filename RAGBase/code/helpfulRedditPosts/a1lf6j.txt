LPT: If you feel an employee went above and beyond, complimenting them is one thing, but letting their supervisor know can be much more impactful in gaining them recognition.

A few words to the right person goes such a long way in some industries. 

Plenty of people acknowledge good work/service to the employee that did it - and nothing is wrong with that obviously - but also taking a few extra seconds to say/email a few positive words to their boss can be a monumental boost to that person's career advancement or even emotional state.

Sure, not all companies/bosses are good at acknowledging this kind of thing, but for those not familiar with these kind of industries, it is not uncommon many managers will keep close tabs on positive reviews, give the employee positive recognition at a meeting, and result in a higher evaluation of that employee when a promotion is available. It's one of the biggest career advancing returns from the most minimal effort there is - but only the customers can provide it.
