YSK that full body scanners at airport security have trouble reading glittery sweaters, and will likely get you searched and patted down

I wish I had thought to post this earlier in the winter before the sweetener post reminded me. Back in December while traveling I wore a sweater with glittery threads woven through it, and apparently the machines can’t read those so the TSA agents had to spend about 30 minutes patting me down, testing my hands for residue, etc. If you’re bringing one make sure it’s in your checked bag otherwise it’ll be quite a hassle!
