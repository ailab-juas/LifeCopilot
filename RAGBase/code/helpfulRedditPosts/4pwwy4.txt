LPT: If something awkward happens to you in public, don't look around to see if people are looking.

content:
When something awkward happens, the first instinct is to look and see if anyone noticed. I'm talking about any personal awkwardness inflicted unto you through your own human fumble, another human's fumble, or candid act of fate. This isn't the Maury result type of awkward. Instead of looking around, make it funny.
