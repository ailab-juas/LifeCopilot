title:
YSK "MAP" is a common acronym pedophiles use to identify themselves online

content:
"MAP" stands for "minor-attracted person" and is a commonly used way for pedophiles to identify themselves as such online while trying to avoid the stigma of the term "pedophile." It's frequently used by pedophiles who are trying to invade contemporary society and make pedophilia socially acceptable. They also frequently try to portray MAPs as an LGBTQ group or other oppressed group in an effort to garner influence and acceptance. We as a civil society must combat this attempt at a movement for the safety of children everywhere.

Edit: According to u/ZephyrstormUwU, the pear emoji üçê is also a common identifier. If anyone has further identifiers, let me know and I'll add them

Edit: u/SporkDay: NOMAP = No Contact Minor Attracted Person, yet another way for them to add layers and try to justify themselves
