YSK A for-profit company will always try to minimize your salary. It is your duty to maximize it and there is no shame in it.

Why YSK: There is a mindset, especially with younger adults, that it is taboo to ask for more money. For example during a job interview a company will state your wage structure. Now, if you respectfully treat this as a business negotiation, there is nothing wrong with simply discussing it. Don't be rude but ask at least. You're not 'begging' and you're not 'being selfish'. You are putting a price on your time and labor. It is your right to ask if you feel it is appropriate, it is their right to decline if they want to. Again, don't be rude about it if you're in either position.
