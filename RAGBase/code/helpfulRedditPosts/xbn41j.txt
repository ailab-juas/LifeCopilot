YSK if you have an elderly or disabled family member, or anyone who might struggle to open jars, they make a robotic can opener that works amazingly well.

Why YSK?  It's a game changer in the kitchen for my elderly relatives.  It's called RoboTwist. So, I bought one on a whim and the first thing I used it on was a jar of honey that has followed me to 3 different homes.  A jar that I, as a 43 y/o 6'3", 350lb large, muscular, metal worker, could not open, and I'll be damned if this thing didn't pop the lid right off.  No pre-soak, right from the cupboard.  I immediately bought one for my mom and aunts (all in their 60's) and to this day have not found a lid to defeat this device.  Jam, No problem, molasses, done deal.  Pickles, all day long.

I just thought I would post about it here because seeing it, you might think it's gimmicky or not very strong.  Take my word.  This thing is stronger than me.  Every home should have one IMO.
