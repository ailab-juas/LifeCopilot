title:
YSK that if you wake up just in time for a meeting or call, your voice gives you away

content:
Why YSK: if you just wake up you have a morning voice and whether you hear it or not, usually other people can tell. It might make you seem less professional especially if you work from home. 

My suggestion is to sing along to a song before you get on your first call, and usually that will warm up your vocal chords enough to get rid of your sleepy creaky voice.

edit: I think a lot of people dislike this post because they’re conflating how things should be with how things are. When you work from home people don’t have all the same data as they do if they can see you, read your body language, and see how hard you’re working. They don’t know what kind of day you’ve had. All people have to go off of is what you type, how you sound, and what work you get done. I genuinely believe how you sound is important if you’re customer-facing. I’m trying to help you!
