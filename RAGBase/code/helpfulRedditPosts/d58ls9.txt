title:
YSK that mediocre CPR is better than no CPR

content:
I've heard multiple people say that they'd be reluctant to perform CPR, despite being trained, because they're afraid they would mess it up or do it wrong.

You should know that if someone isn't breathing and has no pulse, you can't make it worse. Doing even mediocre CPR gives them at least some chance. 

"He ain't getting any deader!"
