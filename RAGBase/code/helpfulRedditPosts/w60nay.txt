title:
[LPT] Always attend another culture’s event on an empty stomach. There’s nothing people love sharing more than our culinary traditions with others.

content:
Feeding visitors is human nature. It doesn’t matter where you’re from or which event you’re attending, food will almost certainly be a part of it and will be foist upon you as an outsider. If you think you won’t be able to stomach unfamiliar foods, pack a snack and some OTC digestive meds. Still, keep an open mind and empty stomach.

Edit: I get it. I said event when I meant festivity. I also didn’t account for every culture. I was speaking from personal experience which did not include many of the cultures reading this. I genuinely apologize for that. I am aware of things like “happy hour” and of events that don’t involve food. If I could edit the title and add caveats, I would.
