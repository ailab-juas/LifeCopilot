title:
LPT: If you drop something small on the floor and can't find it, put a sock over the vacuum arm. There will be enough suction to pick up the thing you lost, but it won't be sucked into the vacuum itself.

content:
 Make sure the sock doesn't have holes.

You can also stretch the sock and secure it with a rubber band.
