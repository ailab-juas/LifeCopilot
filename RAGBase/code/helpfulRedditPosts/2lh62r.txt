LPT: Keep a winter hat and pair of gloves in your car in case it breaks down.

content:
It's getting towards that time of year. Living in Michigan, I've learned during the winter seasons it's smart to keep at least a good winter hat, decent pair of gloves that will keep you warm for hours, and (bonus) wool socks. 

If your car breaks down in freezing temperatures, the last thing you want to happen is get frostbite or nearly freeze to death waiting for your help to come. 

Edit: guess I could also mention, bring some one use hand warmers.
