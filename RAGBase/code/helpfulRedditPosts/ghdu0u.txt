LPT: When someone you love wants to pursue a dream, Don't be afraid you'll lose them. In fact when someone lives their dreams, they often become the best potential version of themself. It's much more of a loss to never see the better, happier person they could become.

Edit: I see the usual amount of pedantic counter arguements in the comments.

You understand that by dream we are talking about something you've wanted to do for years and something that will bring passion and completion to your life. 

No, Expecting your wife to support your random, sudden "dream" to open a bakery because you've been watching Buddy on TLC for the last few weeks and think it looks fun is not a counter arguement to my tip. Do You really not understand how that's not the same thing?

Personal Example: I wanted to go teach English abroad and my girlfriend was a bit fearful for our relationship going long distance. It had been my dream for years and she supported it. She saw how happy it made me, how much it completed me, how much new confidence I gained. It could have been a disaster but it was my dice to roll, we're both really glad I did, because it made me a lot happier.
