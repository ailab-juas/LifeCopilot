YSK: IMDB has an advanced search to find movies that fit your criteria!

content:
This is a great way to find specific types of movies you want to watch, whether it be a movie that was released in a specific time span, a genre or just movies with great reviews.

**http://www.imdb.com/search/title**

Some of the options available are:

* Title type - Feature film, TV series and more
* Release date
* User rating and number of votes
* Genres
* Exclude titles you have already voted on

**I use this all the time and it has been very helpful!**
