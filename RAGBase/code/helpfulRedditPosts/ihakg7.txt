title:
YSK that even though it sounds right, "could of" is actually "could've" as in "could have"

content:
Could've, should've, and would've are the correct written forms of these words. 

I think the confusion comes from the weird contraction "couldn't've" as in "could not have", leading people to "couldn't of".

Why YSK: having good written communication is a huge leg up in the professional sphere, whether in business or academics.

Edit: by "sounds right" I mean that in spoken English the pronunciations are so similar that the mistake isn't audible (at least in some American and Australian accents).
