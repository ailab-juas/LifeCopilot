LPT: If you ever come across an old coin collection (eg after the death of a grandparent), resist the temptation to clean the coins. You will destroy their value.

content:
Even if you're not a coin collector, at some point you will almost certainly come into contact with old (and potentially valuable) coins. It can be tempting to try and shine them up before you take them in to get appraised, but don't! Cleaning a coin will destroy up to 50% of its numismatic (coin collecting) value. 

No matter how dirty or tarnished the coin is, it will *always* be more valuable uncleaned.

EDIT: As pointed out by a bunch of people, this is a general rule for any antique.
