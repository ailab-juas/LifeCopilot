YSK Dirty hummingbird feederâ€™s kill hummingbirds.

content:

Why YSK: If your hummingbird feeder is cloudy or moldy please take down immediately and clean it as cloudy or moldy feed can cause the hummingbirds tongue to swell called Hummers candidiasis. Once swollen the hummingbird cannot eat causing it to starve to death. You can clean it by mixing a 10% bleach solution to water and soaking for an hour rinse well and let dry.
