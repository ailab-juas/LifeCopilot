LPT: Don’t say, “I’ve seen that” when your friend shares a meme, screenshot, etc. of something funny. It makes people feel good to share something they like and think you’ll enjoy.

I’ve recently started doing this because I like when my friends have a positive reaction to something I share, as opposed to feeling “late to the party” by sharing something they’ve already seen. It makes me, and I imagine others, feel good to give my friends a laugh.
