YSK that if you are planning a surprise for someone on an important day that giving them a small treat at the beginning of the day to show you remembered will be a much better cover and positive experience for them than making them miserable thinking you forgot or didn’t care about them.

Soooo many people (three that I’ve read on Reddit today alone) think that it will be cool and a great cover to make the person think that they forgot or don’t care about a birthday or anniversary etc.  All it does is make the person sad and miserable all day.  And then when the surprise happens they feel guilty and ashamed for feeling sad and miserable.  All around not good.

Edit: Aw!  Thanks for the award!
