YSK we can hear you as soon as you drive up to the speaker.

I work at a coffee shop with a drive thru. As soon as your car is on the sensor we hear a “BONNGG” on our headsets and can hear your car running, and just about everything that happens or is said. We can’t tune it out. Whether we’ve started taking your order or not, we hear you. Even when we’re done taking your order and you’re waiting to move up, we hear you. For the love of god, don’t have super personal conversations or blast your music while on that pad. It’s distracting and impedes on our process.
