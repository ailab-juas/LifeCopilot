[LPT] If you can't afford your medical bills, ask if you can apply for a charitable write-off.

Earlier this year I went to the ER at two AM because I thought my appendix was going to burst. It was a kidney stone, and later I got a bill for six thousand dollars. I've been making about 20k the past three years, and after a heartfelt letter about not wanting to risk homelessness this winter and a few tax returns/pay slips I haven't heard from them since.

You won't know unless you ask, because they won't tell you.
