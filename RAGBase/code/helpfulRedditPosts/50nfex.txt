LPT: When you have a laptop for college, make sure you make two accounts. One for studying and one for all other things.

content:
A clean desktop and lack of games (you can remove them per user) can really limit distractions. Put a website blocker on the browser of the account for studying, this will prevent you even more from procrastinating.  

Taking this to the extreme: bonus points for everyone who dualboots Windows and Linux or uses VMs!

If you found the above too extreme, you can also try [multiple virtual desktops in Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/197625/how-to-use-virtual-desktops-in-windows-10/) as some of you have suggested.

**Edit:** This could also apply to a work environment, call it a presentation account.

**Edit 2:** If you have a Mac, download the *SelfControl* app. You can block any sites that you mindlessly type in when you are trying to distract yourself from studying. /u/glazzies

**Edit 3:** Use *leechblock* to block websites on Firefox and *StayFocusd* on Chrome.
