title:
LPT If you have a time limit for a power point presentation, look more prepared by putting any extra slides at the end in case someone asks a question on a topic you could not discuss.

content:
Tip from a teacher I got.  Weird to word it but if you only have a few minutes to present and you can't get to everything you wanted place those extra slides after your sources/last slide.  Not only will you look slick you will also look very well prepared.

edit: when I say "could not discuss" I meant you did not have time to discuss that certain point but it is relevant and theres a good chance during the question and answer section that it will come up.  Hope that clears it up.
