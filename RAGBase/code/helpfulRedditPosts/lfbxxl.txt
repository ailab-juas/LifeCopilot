title:
YSK if you break through ice look for a dark spot.

content:
Why YSK: Might save your life to know that the ice above you covering the water appears white from underneath, and the hole you broke through looks dark. So, look for a dark spot when swimming up.

Also good to know: Once you found it, turn your back to the ledge, put your elbows over the ledge and make swimming movements with your legs, as if you were swimming on your back. Like this you should be able to slide over the edge on top of the ice. Keep lying on your back, pushing yourself away from the place you broke through, then turn on your belly and crawl or roll to safety, without using knees or elbows.

Edit: I meant of course crawl or roll, not rob, to not confuse you further.

Edit 2: To all people calling bullshit: This is public advice from the danish authorities, source is here:

I believe it’s because when you scuba dive under meter thick ice, it might appear dark, but that’s probably not the ice you typically break through. Personally, I have not had the pleasure yet, so can’t be sure.
