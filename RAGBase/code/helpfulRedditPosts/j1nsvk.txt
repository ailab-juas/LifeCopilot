LPT: When you can afford it, set aside some money to spruce up your living or work space little by little. Art, plants, trinkets, and even lights are all small ways to add some color to your life and improve your mental health.

Plants, in particular, are amazing for those suffering from anxiety and depression. They add color, improve air quality, and provide something to care for (that isn't as financially or emotionally expensive as a pet). Set timers to make sure you don't forget to water and care for them when you're in a funk.  


Art doesn't have to be classical paintings. It can be as simple as a "Live, Laugh, Love" on a poster. It could even be art you make yourself! Photographs of friends and family are also great for this. Seeing beautiful or thought-provoking images can help take you out of your own head.
