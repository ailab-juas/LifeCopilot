title:
YSK Craving ice is a symptom of iron deficiency.

content:
There are other symptoms that people don't realize, such as hair loss in women which I was surprised to learn as its not commonly listed as a possible reason for sudden shedding. I unknowingly dealt with iron deficiency from my teens up until my late twenties before I got treated for it when my levels stubbornly wouldn't move from 10. I also couldn't explain my obsession with slurpees and crunching on the ice after finishing my soft drink. I found it soothing, and I just figured I had a weird stress reliever or tick. After 8 months of prescribed iron supplements, I watched my ferritin levels jump from 10 to 75... the urge to eat ice is nonexistant and I haven't craved slurpee for months. 

Why YSK: Even mild but long term iron deficiency can effect the quality of your life significantly. I was pale, tired and unable to work out properly without feeling dizzy. My hair grew back, albeit pretty spriggy and short at the moment, but there's lots of new growth. No more ice cravings. I never need to take a nap after work anymore, and I can make it up a mountain now without rapidly burning out or feeling lightheaded.
