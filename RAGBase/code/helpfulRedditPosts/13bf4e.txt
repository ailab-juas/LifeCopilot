LPT: Be extra friendly to people who work in customer service positions. They know all the tricks and will often go out of their way to help you out.

content:
They deal with shitty people with bad attitudes all day long. Be the person who's friendly and asks how their day has been. Ask if there's anything they would recommend or if there are any good deals going on and see what they say.

Plus, what's the harm in being friendly to people? Worst case scenario, you made their shift a little brighter.

EDIT:

I can't stress this enough, please don't expect special treatment. Being nice does not entitle you to anything and if you do happen to benefit, please be grateful. I'm trying to illustrate the value of being a good person and why it can actually help you!

As /u/loves_reposts eloquently stated:
*LPT: just be nice to people, dammit*

A good tip I read:

1) When contacting a call center, take a couple minutes to do the survey. Companies apparently heavily rely on these to evaluate the workers. Be sure to rate the PERSON and not the company! 
BONUS: Ask for the manager if you've had especially great service to give them recognition.
