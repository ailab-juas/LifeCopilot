YSK that tires are one of the most important safety features on your car. Everything you do to control your vehicle--steering, braking, and accelerating--goes from you, through the car, to the ground through your tires. Without good tires, your car cannot perform as safely as possible.

**Why YSK.** Every car has expenses and headaches, but being cheap about new tires, or waiting too long to replace old tires, will negatively affect everything you can do in your vehicle. Regardless of your ability as a driver, your car will never be able to perform as it should without tires that are properly fitted, rotated, aligned, and inflated. Bad tires are directly responsible for [as many as 10,000 vehicle crashes per year](https://www.nhtsa.gov/es/tires/safety-and-savings-ride-your-tires), and are a factor in many more. 

While good tires allow you to break, turn, and accelerate as quickly and efficiently as your car will allow, bad tires decrease your ability to do all of these things, and make driving much more dangerous. 

Buying and maintaining tires can seem like a needless exercise, but it's one of the best things you can do to make sure you're as safe as you can be behind the wheel. [Finding the best tire](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/11084a_tirehome_102918_v5_tag_0.pdf)s for your car and your local environmental conditions is always worth while.
