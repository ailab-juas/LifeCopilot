title:
YSK that having sex as a woman will not effect the tightness if your vagina

content:
This is a myth perpetuated by men in order to shame women for having a prolific sex life. Your "body count" has absolutely nothing to do with the tightness of your vagina. 

**Myth #1: sex is what loosens the vagina**
Your vagina only ever loosens from age and childbirth. Even then, the loosening is extremely mild. Sex does not stretch the vagina permanently. 

**Myth #2: Women are tighter from lack of penetration**
Tightness actually results from climaxing, unfulfilling sex, and lack of foreplay. Being "too tight" to enjoy sex is likely a sign of an underlying and potentially treatable issue with a woman's reproductive system. 

**Myth #3: Women who have many sex partners have large/deformed/hanging labias**
Sex has no effect on the size or shape of a woman's labia. Women shamed for having "roast beef" labias are born with them and they do not result from any sex. It has no correlation to the tightness of one's vagina and shames both women and girls alike over something so unbelievably miniscule. 

**Why is it important that women know this?**
Because it is important for everyone, male or female, to understand their own bodies. This particular issue is one that is very widespread and very commonly believed. However, they are only myths perpetuated by men to shame women who are sexually active. There is no reason to feel any guilt nor shame for engaging in sexual activities as a female, and there are no physical consequences so long as protection is used. Don't let yourself be shamed over something that is blatantly incorrect. If anyone tries to, feel free to point out that they are wrong. 

Hopefully this will help some ladies understand their bodies better and not feel ashamed about their sex lives, as well as prevent them from feeling ashamed in the future. I also hope that this will help men understand women's anatomy a bit better.

**Edit:**

Holy shit, I did not expect this to blow up the way it did. It was definitely a surprise waking up to 3 awards and 140 notifications. 

First off, I'd like to address the first sentence of my post. Women contribute to the spreading of this myth, however, it was originally created and spread by men. Women were and still are, told these myths by men for the sake of slut shaming. So yes, women are somewhat at fault, but men are the main perpetrators. 

Secondly, thank you so much for the platinum, gold, and silver awards!! This is absolutely amazing and completely made my day. I sound like a broken record to my friends with how much I keep talking about the responses to this post. 

Thirdly, no, your anecdotal evidence and feelings  do not outweigh scientific evidence and trusted sources. Stop that.
