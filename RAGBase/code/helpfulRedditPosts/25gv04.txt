LPT: When submitting a resume by e-mail, send your file in PDF, to ensure your formatting doesn't change

content:
I recently emailed my resume in for a job. After opening up the file on a different computer, I noticed the format had changed and some of the words were on different lines, making it look messy, thus lowering my chance of getting the job.
TL;DR With a PDF file, no matter what platform you open it with, the content will look the exact same.
