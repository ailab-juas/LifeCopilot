LPT If you're planning on visiting San Francisco please for the love of God do not leave ANYTHING of even a vague resemblance of value in your car, or your windows will get smashed and you'll lose it.

I'm not talking about a laptop or a purse. I'm talking about a hoodie, a blanket, a travel mug, a USB cable, or heaven forbid a few coins in plain sight. Hell, even kids toys aren't safe.

Tinted windows are practically a guarantee your windows will get smashed. The biggest pain in the ass is getting the windows replaced, not necessarily whatever gets stolen.

Buddy of mine who used to live in lower Haight got his car windows smashed so often he decided to just leave them down one night. He woke up to find THREE homeless people sleeping in his car.
