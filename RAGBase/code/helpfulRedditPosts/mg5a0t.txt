LPT: if you’re too lazy to wash your dishes when you’re done with them, at least rinse/soak them so the food doesn’t dry. You’ll thank yourself when you work up the motivation to wash them or put them in the dishwasher

content:
Edit: I get it. You should just wash dishes as you use them. BUT, for anyone with kids, jobs, depression, and anything else that gets in the way of ideal productivity, this is the way. I’m glad this helped some, and I’m sorry this triggered so many others. This tip isn’t for the people who attack the day with vim and vigor. It’s for normal people who sometimes struggle with everyday tasks. Also, this is not for cast iron. Thank you.
