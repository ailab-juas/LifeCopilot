LPT: Listen to audiobooks while you do tedious tasks, or play video games.

content:
I've listened attentively to about 20 books this summer, and that's probably more books than I've ever read.

Cleaning, vacuuming, mowing the lawn(if you can get powerful enough headphones), driving, etc. can all be productive if you just pop in an audiobook to accompany whatever you're doing. Personally I've been listening to audiobooks while streaming stocks.
It also works well playing games that don't require a lot of attention.

If you're mining linearly in block-building game- listen to an audiobook. Setting up your base in early stages of an RTS game- listen to an audiobook. Grinding for some RPG or MMORPG- listen to an audiobook.

It's a great way to be productive while otherwise doing a mindlessly tedious task. Since the task is so simple, it requires little-to-no brainpower and you can easily concentrate on your book whilst doing it.

EDIT: There's been some discussion- listening to audiobooks while working out isn't for everyone. It's worked well for some people, and horribly (including myself) with others. If you've tried it before while working out and it hasn't worked out for you, give it a shot while doing other things.
