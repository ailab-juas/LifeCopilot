LPT: Make sure you have cold meds and painkillers on hand BEFORE you get sick. Once you're actually sick, it can be difficult, dangerous and wildly irresponsible to visit a store to purchase them.

As someone currently suffering from COVID, I'm very thankful I have plenty of Sudafed, cough syrup, Mucinex, ibuprofen and acetaminophen in my medicine cabinet. Even grab some Gatorade if that's your go-to when sick. I'm fully vaccinated so symptoms are very manageable with the aid of OTC products.

Note - don't mix drugs without checking for interactions first. And lots of products have overlapping ingredients so make sure you're not unintentionally doubling up on anything.

Edit: as someone pointed out, don't stock up on opioids. Go with OTC NSAIDs and other fever/pain relievers.
