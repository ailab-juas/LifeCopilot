YSK this way to set your MS Teams status to Available- and it won't change to idle after 5 minutes

content:
Why YSK: In Teams, go to Calendar, and then Meet Now. This will create a meeting with just yourself. Once the meeting is started, your status will be set to red/on a call. Click on your icon bubble and set your status to green/available. As long as the meeting is active your status will not change back to orange, even if you have Teams minimized.
