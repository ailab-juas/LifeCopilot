LPT: When chatting with someone who you know is shy / more of an introvert sometimes give them options to questions

content:
I used to be quite a shy person and when people used to ask "so did you go out at the weekend?" I always used to feel ashamed that I wasn't agreeing to their statement. Feels a lot better when someone asks "so go out at the weekend or just have a chilled one?" or "So you have a girlfriend at the moment or are you just keeping it casual?" I just noticed it myself and thought it might make a difference to someone else's day anyway.
