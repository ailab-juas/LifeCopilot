LPT: When you order flowers for Mother's Day online, fill out everything except the last step, then leave the page. They will probably email you with a discount as an incentive to complete your order.

Pro Flowers and From You Flowers both do this. I don't know about other places but it's worth a try. Flowers are expensive!

Edit: grammar

Edit: Thanks for all your bonus LPT's! My mom lives in a very rural area and the nearest florist is 30 miles away. I assumed the delivery cost would be outrageous and I actually prefer the "buds in a box" to an arrangement since it will end up sitting on the porch with cats, chickens, etc if nobody is home when it arrives. I might look more thoroughly into other options next time though!
