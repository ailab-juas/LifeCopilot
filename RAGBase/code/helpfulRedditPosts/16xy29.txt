YSK about the Armenian Genocide, which saw the brutal extermination of over 1 million Armenians beginning in 1915 and still goes largely unrecognized today.

I had a long conversation with a friend of mine who's of Armenian descent and she told me alot about the [Armenian Genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide) that took place in the early 1900s. It was one of the if not the first major human atrocity after the turn of the century, yet it's been completely overlooked even in spite of the global consciousness of similar albeit much larger events (i.e. The Holocaust). There's even an incredibly terrifying yet captivating quote from [Adolf Hitler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hitler_Armenian_Quote.JPG) on the matter.

What was most compelling for me though was that because of the nature of the events, the entire Armenian culture that exists today is a direct result of these events. My friend's grandmother for example became an orphaned refugee at age 13. She was forced to flee her home and go to Iran, resulting in further persecution as you might imagine since she was Christian. She eventually got married and had children before emigrating to the US, where a significant number of the Armenian population exists today. It's especially interesting to note how quickly and drastically the culture has been varied and fragmented over just 2-3 generations as a result of refugees sprouting Armenian communities in the different parts of the world where they settled. It also remains a remarkably personal issue for the Armenian community today in part because they're still recovering (the worldwide population of Armenian people is just north of 10 million), but also because many grew up with relatives directly affected by the genocide.


It made it really easy to empathize with the magnitude of this tragedy when it occurred to me that my grandparents were old enough to have potentially gone through this. It also really made me feel for them in that there's so much neglect due to politics and international relations. I then remembered the White House's new petition system and did a quick Google search and came up with [this](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/recognise-occurrence-armenian-genocide/RNn4zJ2v). I for one think that a response on this would be incredibly interesting.

**Edit: Glad to see that this actually gained some traction. Again, if any of you think that this issue deserves more attention, take a second to [sign the petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/recognise-occurrence-armenian-genocide/RNn4zJ2v).**
