LPT: If you want to look forward to getting to work, don't allow yourself coffee until you're there.

Depends on a few things, like how early you get up and if you like coffee.  Or if you don't like going to work.  But recently I realized this was happening for me as nice little incentive to get out the door... so I got that going for me which is nice.
