LPT: If you get injured on the job, and you have to take time off work or not, document the fuck out of it.

Learning experience : long story short I got injured on the job and was out work for 2 weeks. Tried to get unemployment and was completely unprepared for the questions that I was asked. I eventually got it but the process could have been smoother. Write down everything,  get exact times,  dates,  who you talked to and what time. Any documents you get from your employer or doctor scan it and upload and make hard copies.
