YSK: In case you ever lose your Android phone, there is an applet which turns its ringer up to 100% if you text it

content:
I've seen products such as the Trackr pixel out there which make your phone ring if you've lost it, even if it was on silent. I thought I'd share a free alternative to this.
All you need is a free account with [If This, Then That](https://ifttt.com). Once you have an account, you can set up [this applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/178144p-text-your-lost-android-phone-to-turn-the-ringer-volume-up-100).
Essentially, when your phone receives a text with a specified keyword/phrase, its ringtone will be turned up to max volume.

Edit: If you have an Alexa or Google Home, there are also more direct ways to find your phone via the same site [here](https://ifttt.com/applets/341784p-tell-alexa-to-find-your-phone) and [here](https://ifttt.com/applets/479253p-tell-google-assistant-to-call-your-phone), respectively.
