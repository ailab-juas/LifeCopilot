LPT: Help protect your grandparents from scammers by saying your name when they answer the phone.

content:
A common scam people try to pull on the elderly is to call them and say something like "Hi Grandma, I'm stuck and I need money to get home."  often the victim will say "Oh is this Jake?  Where are you?" after hearing a name the scammer will assume that identity "Yes, this is Jake, my car broke down in another province and I need you to transfer me money to get it repaired so I can come home."  

The problem here is the victim asked who was on the other end of the phone.  When calling your grandparents, when they pick up the phone you say "Hi Grandma, it's Jake."  
That way they know that if one day someone calls asking for money, they not only know not to ask who it is by giving a name.  But they also know that if the person does say it's you that that couldn't be true because you always give your name when you call.


I started doing this with my grandmother after she told me she got a call one time just like the one I described above.  Someone called and said they were in jail and needed money for bail.  She said "Oh, is this Jake?" and the scammer said "Yes it is."  They insisted she didn't need  to come  to the police station but that they definitely needed the money.  She went to the bank to make the withdrawal and the excellent tellers realized it was a scam and stopped her.  
Since then I told her I would always give my name when I call and have been doing so for years.  
She had one other time someone called and she asked who was on the phone (asking for mine or my brothers name) and the scammer said it was me.  She realized that couldn't be right because I always say it's me after saying hello.
