YSK: How to actually help the Rain-forest

content:
 In 2019 there have been 73,000 recorded fires in the Amazon  rainforest.  The Reddit Community is spreading awareness, which is great, but there are other ways to help.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to donate money to organizations that protect the rainforest, here are some options in alphabetical order:

[Amazon Conservation Association](https://www.amazonconservation.org/)

[Amazon Conservation Team](https://www.amazonteam.org/)

[Amazon Watch](https://amazonwatch.org/)

[Rainforest Foundation US](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)

[Rainforest Trust](https://www.rainforesttrust.org/)

[Rainforest Action Network](https://www.ran.org/mission-and-values/)

&amp;#x200B;

If you can't donate money, you can spread awarness with the hashtag: #amazonrainforest

and you can write to your  [elected officials](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials)  to help promote action on the issue.
