LPT: If you have sticky residue on something, mix two parts vegetable/coconut oil with three parts baking soda. Works better than store bought Goo Gone

Simple as that. Mix it up, scoop it on, rub it in with your fingers, &amp; wash with soap and water to remove the oil. 

Works on any material and won't scratch glass!!
