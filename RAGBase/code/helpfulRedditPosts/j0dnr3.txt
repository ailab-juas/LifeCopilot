LPT: If you need to go to Emergency, take your phone &amp; a power cord. With Covid, they won't let anyone in the ER with you. You will be alone, and your phone is the only way you can let worried family and friends know how you're doing.

I ended up in ER 3 weeks ago with AFib -- for 6 hours. I had my phone, but no power cord. My husband was in our car in the parking lot. The ER had no power cords. Not only was I alone in a very scary situation, but I watched with despair as my battery drained towards zero. Luckily, the battery lasted until they admitted me, then the floor nurses helped me by charging it at the nurse’s station.
UPDATE: Wow!!! THANK YOU EVERYONE! I did not expect this to blow up. I’m glad I can help others avoid a situation that makes a scary situation worse.
CLARIFICATION: I did not know I was going to be in ER. I went to Urgent Care to get a short treatment/antibiotic. I was shocked, and unprepared, when they told me I had heart failure and they me immediately to the ER. Upon getting out of the car at the ER, I grabbed the USB power cord we keep in the center console. There was no waiting room (due to Covid?) - just a glassed in reception area. They took one look at the EKG from Urgent Care, and took me to an ER treatment room and started working on me. At that point I was tethered to the bed with IVs, so even a short 110v power cord would have been a problem. I asked the nurses, repeatedly, for help charging my phone. They told me they had no power cords, and no USB outlets.
GOOD NEWS: I'm fine now. During the 3 days in the hospital, they were able to normalize my heart rhythms, and put me on the appropriate meds.
