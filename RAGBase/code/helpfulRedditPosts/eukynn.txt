LPT teach your young kids how to access and use your phone in case of emergency. How to dial 911 with a locked phone. How to use Siri or OK google to dial a relative. Which relatives to call.

Go even further and show them how to do it. There was a mini scare that got me thinking and wanted to share

- For children, write down the full address (### Street Name, Town, Apt #, Buzz Code, etc.) and the phone number they would be calling from, and tape it beside the phone (if you have a landline) or on a place the child can easily see it like the fridge. We just need to know where we are going before anything else. (credit to that-canadian-girl, a 911 operator)

- if you're an older adult have your kids show you how to call 911 from a locked phone. (credit to blueyork)
