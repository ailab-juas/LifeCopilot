YSK that Costco's Kirkland Signature brand line of spirits are made by name brand distilleries, with only slight variances in recipe and style

content:
I bought some Kirkland brand bourbon from Costco and I was surprised at the quality of it, having expected something along the lines of a "well" whiskey. As a longtime bartender, I wondered where they're getting their product. 

After a little research online, it seems likely that their bourbon is the by-product of Knob Creek or Jim Beam Black, perhaps the batches with too much flavor variance. It is made by Buffalo Trace, in the style of Knob Creek/Jim Beam Black/Old Grandad. 

Their vodka is supposedly an almost identical recipe to Grey Goose, their tequila is probably made by Sauza, and their wines are mostly high quality from large wine producers. 

In many states, you can walk right in to a Costco and buy alcohol without even having a membership, though you may have to go through the trouble of talking to a manager about it as this rule varies according to state law.

Anyway, Kirkland Signature is a pretty good value, with decent product, and can save you some big money for your next party!
