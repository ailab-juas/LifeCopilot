YSK that if you find a wild animal, its often illegal and more unhelpful to feed them and care for them.

content:
I’m a licensed wildlife rehaber and I see many videos on the internet showing people saving wild animals. We also get a lot of animals at my center that people have kept for two or three days. Sometimes it’s two or three weeks. You should know that most animals require a specialized diet in rehab. And that when you save an animal and feed it the wrong thing, often it’ll lead to death or things like metabolic bone disease. 

Yes we are grateful you found it, please bring it to us within 24 hours if you can. That gives it the best chance. And please please do not feed it no matter how many Tik Toks you’ve seen of feeding baby birds cat food.
