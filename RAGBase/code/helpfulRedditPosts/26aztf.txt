LPT: Looking for a product's closest competitors? Search their name followed by 'vs' in Google to get a list of products considered to be similar.

I've been using this trick for years, and most times I mention it to people, they had never heard of it. 

E.G. Looking for a DLSR camera, and your friend has a Canon 5D and you'd like to know what other cameras in the market are considered similar?

Boom. [instant list](http://www.glowingrectangles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/canon5d.jpg).

Here are some more examples: [Google &amp; the power of 'vs'](http://www.glowingrectangles.com/2014/05/vs-2-letter-secret-quick-effective-product-comparison-using-google/)

I use this about 5-10x per day when researching stuff online. Great time saver.
