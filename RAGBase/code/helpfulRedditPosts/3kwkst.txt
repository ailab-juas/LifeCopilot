LPT: When carrying heavy cardboard boxes (e.g. flatpack furniture), slightly dampen your hands with water. It will greatly increase your grip and control.

content:
Obviously you don't want to completely soak the cardboard and thus weaken it. However by wetting your hands just a little, you'll find heavy cardboard boxes much easier to lift and move. The key thing is that improves your grip on the container so more of your energy goes to where you intended. The drier your skin, the worse your grip and the more you find your hands slipping.

(Confirmed this after a weekend of Ikea unpacking!)
