LPT: If your pet is older and has always been kind of independent and not cuddly, and they suddenly start being cuddly they might be telling you it's their time to go, and you should have a plan in place for when that time comes

My cat had always been very independent. He didn't play with toys and he didn't really sleep with me,  he just asked to be let outside and fed and occasionally asked for attention. He was a good cat and everyone loved him.  As he got older he just wanted to be left alone.  He was 11.  2 days before he took a turn for the worst he was perfectly fine but very lovey. Then we had to rush him to the vet to find out he had liver failure and nothing could be done. Cats hide sickness really well.  He had a regular check up in a few weeks,  but it was too late.  

I tried my best to help him because they told me he might have a chance. But he was ready to go. 

I played calming music for him with birds and never left his side. I kept him clean and brushed him because he couldn't.  But I still think everyday of what I could have done better,  that I should have noticed something wrong, I should have taken more pictures of him, spent more time with him even though he didn't want it. I wasn't prepared,  I had never dealt with death.  

He was my best friend and helped me through so much pain and hardship.  He was always there for me.  

Please love your pets everyday.  Give them the best of everything. Take lots of pictures.  You never know when you won't be able to see them again.
