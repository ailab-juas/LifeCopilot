LPT: When you get a new (digital) camera make sure the first picture is your contact details

content:
I have gone through a few cameras due to....adventures... So when I got a new one I typed my name, email and phone number with country code on my phone and then took a picture of that.

Sure there is a chance if you lose it they won't care, but there is now at least a better chance you might get it back.

Edit - This has certainly blown up overnight for me. Lots of people who have found cameras &amp; want to return them and only a couple that think they are going to use an email address to come to your house and rob you. *shrug*. 

For those who have found cameras I wonder if there is a 'found cameras' subreddit to let you post pictures &amp; maybe return them. Or maybe one should be setup. Food for thought.
