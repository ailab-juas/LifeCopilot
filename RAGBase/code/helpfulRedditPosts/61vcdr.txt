title:
YSK: These four sites connect you to a wealth of knowledge and learning. I go to them to help me fill my idle time with learning (vs. TV, video games, etc.)

content:
As the title says, I refer to these sites when I have downtime at work or when I'm bored. I've managed to pick up a few new skills (for work and for fun). Here are the sites and a quick word on what I use them for.

[OpenCourser](http://opencourser.com). Good for finding an online course to take, more for in-depth learning + building professional skills.

[NoExcuseList](http://noexcuselist.com). Great for discovering new learning websites. Neatly categorized into sections (like cooking, music).

[KhanAcademy](http://khanacademy.com). (Re-)Learn pretty much every subject taught in K-12. Edit: Also great for college-level math and exam prep (SAT, GMAT, MCAT, etc).

[StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/sites). Get answers from people who are super knowledgeable about all sorts of different things.
