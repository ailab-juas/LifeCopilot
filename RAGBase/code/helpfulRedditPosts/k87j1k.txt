LPT: If you're planning on getting any pets or plants, be prepared to spend more time and money on them than expected. Providing the proper care can end up quite costly

content:
Even if you get a pet that seems "easy to take care of," like a fish, they still need regular cleaning and a surprisingly large tank size to fish ratio. Plants may also need quite a bit in the long run, such as proper lighting, pest and disease control, special soil, bigger pots, plant food, etc.

I would avoid getting any pets or plants if providing the proper care is out of your budget at the moment
