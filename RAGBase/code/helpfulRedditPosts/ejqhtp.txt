LPT Always be cool to the IT people

content:
 The  IT people in any organization have it tough, so be nice to them and one  day it will come back to you.  Its easy to be mad when your stuff  breaks or doesn't work right.  And yes they are asking you dumb simple  questions.  There is a reason- turning it off and then on does actually  work an amazing amount of the time. Work anywhere long enough and you  with either (a) do a dumb thing or (b) click on the even worst thing;  and that's when not being a dick to the poor IT folks will usually pay  off (to the extent not being a dick ever needs any payoff- but you know  what I mean).

This rule generally also applies to door people, cleaning people ect.  They see and talk to *everyone*.  Don't let your bad day effect how you interact with them.  Be professional and warm, even if you have to fake it that day.
