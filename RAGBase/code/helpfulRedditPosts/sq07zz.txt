title:
LPT: You can understand someone without agreeing with them.

content:
In today's world, folks put very little effort into trying to understand an idea that contradicts their own.  This leads to ever increasing division and the "us vs them" mentality.  It is ok to understand why someone does or says something you think is insane or unvirtuous.  You can get why they do it and still think they are wrong.  Just try.  
  
EDIT:  I didn't expect this post to get any attention and I am so happy to see some of the discussions in here...  If I knew that this would happen I would have spent much more time choosing the exact wording.  I feel obligated to add 2 very important things here:  
  
1.  Understanding someone is the best way to change their mind.  Unless you can completely understand what makes a person believe what they believe,  you have very little chance of convincing them otherwise.  
  
2.  When it comes to matters of religion and/or spiritual beliefs, understanding should typically end there.  Understanding their beliefs (even without believing yourself) can be very enlightening, but trying to change someone's spiritual beliefs without their consent is unethical.  If they are curious and want to understand you, that is certainly different.
