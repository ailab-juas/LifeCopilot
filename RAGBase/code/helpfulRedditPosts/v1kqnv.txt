LPT - If you're burned out from work, take the same day of the week off for the whole month as opposed to one week off in the month

content:
I find that when I'm burned out from work. Taking the Mondays off for the entire month leaves me more refreshed as opposed to when I used to just take the whole week off for that month

When I took the whole week off I would simply be dreading going back to work because I got too comfy being at home and in turn would be rested but feeling worse about my mood going back

When I started taking Mondays off for the entire month, I felt like I was fully rested as if I had the whole week off when going back on Tuesday. My mood was alot better and I was able to be productive and not laze about during my time off

Give it a try if you ever feel like a week off doesn't cut it for you

EDIT: Didn't think I'd have to clarify this but it seems like a lot of people couldn't grasp the fact that when I talk about taking days off, I am talking about annual leave, paid time off, holiday or whatever you call it from wherever you're from
