YSK: Air-fried french fries has 70% lesser calories than regular french fries.

Why YSK: Many of us are trying to lose weight and we occasionally crave cheat meals and these cravings can sometimes get out of hand. So, replacing regular fries with air-fried is good because you won't regret after eating and you also won't feel heavy or lazy after eating ai-fried french fries.

Same goes for air-fried chicken nuggets, which has 60% lesser calories than regular chicken nuggets.

When it comes to taste, there's a difference but not much. I'd say that the two air-fried items taste 90% like regular ones. And you get used to them pretty fast.

I honestly like nuggets better this way than regular.
