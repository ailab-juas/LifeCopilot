LPT: If somebody asks you a question and you don't know the answer, admit you don't know. Don't beat around the bush or guess, especially if you're an expert.

content:
Nobody should expect you to know everything, but people should be able to expect you to give the best answer you can.

This is especially true of experts - if you're a doctor or an electrician or a pharmacist or a networking specialist, you're still allowed to say if you don't know.

When you give somebody a beat around the bush answer, they will have less respect for any other information you give them and they will lose confidence in you.

If you give them a guessed or bullshit answer, you may actually do them more harm than not answering at all.

If you think you know, but you're not sure, that's fine too - tell them with that caveat and, better yet, use your resources to either follow up or point them to somebody else who can.
