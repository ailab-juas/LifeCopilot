YSK while travelling, the Google Translate app can instantly translate words through your camera, live by simply pointing your camera at something (without having to take a photo). You can also do this OFFLINE by downloading the language-pack.

Sorry for the crappy title.

Some examples for use:

* Signs
* Labels on washing machines, electronics etc.
* Activity/event details on flyers 
* Supermarket items &amp; pharmaceuticals 
* Medical forms

This technology is called "Augmented Reality Translation". There's something like over 30 languages supported. 

Tap the camera icon after opening the app and it's pretty self-explanatory from there. Make sure you've set the input/output languages correctly. 

When translating text across two or more lines, take a picture pressing the red button and the app will attempt to identify text/characters which you can highlight with your finger to translate. This actually works better overall but I believe this feature is only available with internet. 

Download your language-pack for offline use (augmented reality only) 

Have fun!

EDIT: This technology was first released back in 2010 by Quest Visual and it was called "Word Lens". Since then I think Google bought it and made it 100% free.
