YSK That Valentine's day is a good time to show that you love a friend or family member. It's not just for couples.

**Why YSK:**  A lot of people are having a hard time right now, Showing some kindness can really brighten their day. Although anytime is a good time to show you care sometimes having a holiday is a nice reminder in a busy world. You don't have to spend money just a phone call or text could make a  difference.

Examples: Your grandpa  passed away and now your grandma is alone for the first time on  Valentine's day? Maybe send her some flowers or just give her a call.  You have a good friend that's going through a bad breakup? Buy them a pizza or reach out to them for a night of gaming.
