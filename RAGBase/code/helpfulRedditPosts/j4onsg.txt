LPT: Create a separate "Future Me" identity, and go out of your way to do nice things for them. Easiest form of self-care I've found.

content:
This motivates me like nothing else. When I am NOT in the mood for something (eg buying milk, stacking the dishwasher, bathing the dog) I just think "do it for future OP" and it works every time. It also gives you a little "Ima be my own hero!" feeling.

Then later on, when you benefit from that chore (eg drink that morning coffee, have clean dishes, snuffle your dog's clean lil head) PLEASE PRACTICE GRATITUDE. Just a "thanks, Past Me!" goes such a long way to make you feel loved and like it was totally worth it.

You will be stuck with yourself for the entirety of your existance. Be your best mate. Xx

Edit: Aw shucks, my first award! Thank you, I hope something magical happens to you today!

Edit 2: y'all are amazing. For those procrastinators saying they are the opposite and leave all the worst things for "future you" - sometimes present me needs a break man! Future You might have to show some compassion and understanding. Delegate with love, sometimes go halves in the chore, maybe get Future You a snack for when it's done. Be there for each other ðŸ˜Š
