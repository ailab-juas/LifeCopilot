LPT: Before you buy a house, drive by the house on a Friday and Saturday night (consecutive weekends if you can) to see if youâ€™ll be living next door to a noisy party house.

Edit: thank you for the upvotes and comments! To comment on a few themes in the responses, yes I know some houses sell instantly and even off market but this is a personal observation living in the vicinity of the said party house and wondering if the new next door neighbours knew theyâ€™d be listening to doof doof music every single weekend. Itâ€™s been happening for years. I havenâ€™t complained as I am not too bothered and too far away anyway. And yes, applies to renting too! Glad this has sparked a conversation ðŸ˜€
