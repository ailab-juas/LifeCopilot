LPT: Invest in a good scarf if your winters are harsh. They make such an impact on comfort while outside.

I was one of those people that never thought a scarf was worth the bother. After all, a coat and hat is enough right? Nope. I got a nice wool scarf and it's heavenly. It's like a warm towel around your neck while outside in sub-freezing temps, or even below 40F. 

I feel like I could easily stay out for hours now, whereas before it was always a race to the car or some other warm place. I almost feel vulnerable without one now. It's so nice.
