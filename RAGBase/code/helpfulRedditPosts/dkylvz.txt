YSK that when you come into the emergency room as a trauma patient, you will be stripped down to your underwear

content:
This seems to come as a big surprise to many patients who come in, protesting that “I’m definitely not hurt down there why are you taking my pants off?” Medical staff are trained to check your whole body, because oftentimes even in cases of STABBINGS, patients do not realize where all of their injuries are that may need to be treated. 


So please, don’t accuse everyone of trying to violate you while struggling. The medical staff is just trying to make sure you’re safe.

Edit with additional info:

1. I don’t think you’re reimbursed for any cut clothes, sorry :(

2. Finger in bum is not done at every emergency room. I’ve worked in some where it was protocol, some where it was not 

3. Your clothes aren’t always cut off. If you’re “well enough” to do it yourself sometimes the staff will let you just do it yourself. 

4. If you’re getting undressed like this, a trauma alert/code has likely been called (basically summoning any nearby doctors to come and help). This is typically for the more serious cases, so you probably don’t have to worry about this if you’re coming in with a sprain or such.
