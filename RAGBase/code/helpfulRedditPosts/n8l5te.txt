YSK: waiting 24-48 hours to report a missing person is a Hollywood myth. Those hours are the most crucial to getting help.

Why YSK:

Hollywood has brainwashed a lot of people into thinking that the police will simply shrug and say "sorry, we can't do anything until so-and-so has been missing for 48 hours".  This is absolutely not true, and an extremely dangerous lie.  

The first hours after someone has been noted to be missing are far and away the most important.  If you genuinely suspect that something has happened to somebody, ***do not wait to call the police*****.**  

The sooner you call, the better.  It may save a life.
