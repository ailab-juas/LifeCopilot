LPT: Get a dash cam for your car

content:
Just got in my first accident. 

Driver tried to make a left turn with a yellow yield light, failed to yield and I ran in to them going through the green light. I tried to stop before I hit them, and luckily I didn’t hit them very hard, but it was hard enough to damage my entire front end and dent my radiator. 

They driver and passenger both don’t speak English. So their daughter was on the phone translating for them, and told me I could drive away if no one was hurt. Uhm. No? 

So then the cops come, and the daughter is on the phone explaining what happened, saying I ran a red light and hit them when they had a green light coming from the other street. 

I was so pissed. Not sure if any witnesses came forward or not, but even the cop said that that doesn’t make sense and isn’t what happened most likely. 

I’m in a no fault state, but it most definitely was their failure to yield that caused the entire incident. I did the very best I could and my car is still fucked up, and most likely I will have to pay for the repairs because they won’t admit they were at fault because again, they don’t speak English they don’t even understand what’s being asked of them. 

I wish I had a dash cam. And now I will, and you should too to avoid this headache and confusion. 

Also: keep small dogs in a kennel, luckily my chihuahua is kenneled in car rides, keep your bigger dogs in the backseat. Had my airbags went off and my border collie was in the front she was be severely injured right now.
