LPT: If you want to pet a dog you dont know, kneel down so its at eye level, and hold your hand out and let it come to you and smell your hand. Don't stand over it and reach down, they may think that's a threat

That's how I got bit once, by reaching down to a dog who didn't know me.
Instead kneel down and let them come to your hand to smell you first.


Edit: the responses to this tip. Im not saying to run up to Cujo and put your face in front of his. If a dog is angry or an unknown animal don't go near him. I'm talking about a friendly dog where the owner says it's ok, but just hasn't met you yet.
