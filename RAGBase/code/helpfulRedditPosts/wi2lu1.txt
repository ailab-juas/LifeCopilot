LPT: The best place to use the restroom on long road trips are the lobby restrooms at mid to high end hotels

content:
I’m on the road a lot for work and I struggle with filthy gas station restrooms that are tended to with Febreze once a fiscal quarter.  I don’t know if it’s just a mental block or other people feel the same, but I just lock up in fear.

I’ve found no where more comfortable and inviting than the restrooms on the first floor of all mid-range+ hotels.

Hotels are in every decent sized city I pass. The lobby restroom is usually empty &amp; rarely used beyond check-in time since everyone has a bathroom in their room. They have always been clean and well stocked.  You can generally walk right in past the lobby since the receptionist will just assume you’re already a guest of the hotel.  And there’s usually another exit if you feel self conscious about walking past the front desk again.

___

1st Tier (more privacy, less frequent sudden door handle jiggling when you’re in the middle of managing your affairs)
-	Buc-ee’s
-	Loves / Pilot / Flying J’s
-	Most trucker stops
-	Libraries
-	Kwik Trip
-	Churches
-	Casinos (Mostly agree, it’ll be a 4+ star experience)
-	Fancy Department Stores at the mall
-	Cracker Barrel
-	Hospitals (particularly if you’re there for IBS)

2nd Tier (less privacy, could be out of the way, clean enough)
-	Grocery Stores (mixed experience here. Brookshire’s is fine. If you’re in CA and still have Lucky’s or Albertsons; pretty gross. Safeway is a hit or miss)
-	Target
-	Kohl’s
-	Sporting Equipment Stores

3rd Tier (single public toilet establishments &amp; acceptable to some of you, but I can’t do it if there are any other choices available)
-	Portapoties 
-	Camping Gear Sets
-	Fast Food Restrooms &amp; Subway
-	Colleges (had a lot of experiences with this in school. Mixed bag. If you go to the school, you probably scoped put the best one. Newly built library? Perfect!  The old chem lab? Some floors better than others. 
-	[Warning: Might be sexist] Craft Stores &amp; Joanne’s if you’re a man. Home Depot if you’re a woman. You *people* (*derogatory*) said it.

Under review.  Currently traveling, will confirm. 
-	Lowe’s (due to insider leak - former employee claims it’s impossible due to 3rd party cleaning company)
-	McDonald’s…. maybe.  Do they have paper towels now or do I still have to use the air dryer and open the door with my sleeve?
-	Car Dealerships - mixed bag for me on this one.  Yes they are normally clean, but if you’re parked on the sales side, that sales dude is gonna be waiting for you at the door.

There’s a population of people like me who have a tough time using the restroom without substantial privacy. I think we’re the same group of people who close the door when we use the restroom at home.  Unlike you savages that use the toilet with multiple doors open chit chatting with your kids while you’re watching your bathroom TV and eating Cheetos.
