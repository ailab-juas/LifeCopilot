title:
YSK that when driving on wet winter roads, that when a car in front of you stops producing (or greatly reduces) its spray behind the rear tires that this means they are driving on ice.

Why YSK: You should know this because controlling your speeds and being aware of other other vehicles speeds as well as movements are very important aspects of driving in inclement weather and/or icy roads. Being able to predict what is about to happen or what could possibly happen could help you avoid being part of or causing a very dangerous accident. If you see that the car in front of you is on ice, slow down GRADUALLY (gives cars behind you time to react) and don't turn your wheel suddenly as you can easily lose traction doing so.

Edit: As some comments point out here, the most important thing is to be safe and keep your distance from other cars (minimum 4 seconds travel time AT SAFE SPEEDS on highways). Maintain slower speeds than normal, keep lane switching to a minimum and keep your headlights on! If you're completely uncertain about your traction turn your hazards on to signal caution to other drivers.
