LPT: After taking a shower, manually wipe yourself down with your hands before using a towel. Your towel absorbing less moisture will allow you to use that same towel more frequently before it needs to be washed.

This is a tip my dad gave me years ago while on vacation. I was burning through towels left and right while he managed to use the same one repeatedly without it becoming damp or retaining that funky smell. He told me that after he uses the shower (or coming out of a pool) he will use his hands to thoroughly wipe all droplets clean off of his body before using a towel to finish himself off. He found that his towels lasted much longer and ultimately it was less laundry for him to do.

I’ve shared this tip with quite a few people since then and they seemed to be flabbergasted that such an idea could exist. Some of them have tried it and let me know that it’s been quite a game changer for them.

I don’t know, hopefully one of you on this sub find this useful and start adding to your towel’s lifespan!
