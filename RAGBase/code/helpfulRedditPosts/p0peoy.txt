YSK: Don't think it's wrong to feel grief over the death of a famous person.

content:
Why YSK: Obviously if the person was a horrible person, that is a different conversation. Also, having never known the celebrity, one fan's grief obviously probably doesn't compare to that celebrity's close friends and family, the people who really knew them.

With that said, there's nothing wrong with feeling sadness or grief over someone who was influential to you or provided your life with joy.

Don't mock someone who is grieving over the death of someone who was important to them, even if they had never even met.

And don't let anyone invalidate your feelings over the death of a famous person.

Obviously, you don't want the grief you feel over anyone's death to stricken your life, all I'm saying is that it's okay to feel sadness.
