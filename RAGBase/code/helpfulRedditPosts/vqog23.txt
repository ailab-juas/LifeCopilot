title:
LPT Keep an emergency sanitary kit in your car for the lady in your life

content:
If you have a lady in your life keep a couple of tampons, sanitary pads and a spare pair of underwear in a sandwich bag and put it in your glove box.

That way you're always ready if she is caught short when out and about

Edit: I think something has gotten lost in translation here. 'lady in your life' refers typically to girlfriend/wife' so we're not talking about giving random strangers random underwear here.
