YSK: just because everyone around you is an asshole, doesn’t necessarily mean you are

Why YSK: there’s a saying: if everyone around you is an asshole you might be the actual asshole. Here’s why that’s not always the case. 

People who suffered from trauma (specifically childhood trauma) are often attracted to people similar to the ones they grew up with. Your brain doesn’t care if it’s healthy or unhealthy—your brain cares that it’s familiar. In the same way that you may need to be careful of the partner you choose, be careful of your work environment, friends, and social community. 

Certain environments attract a certain type of individual, all who might be similarly distasteful or toxic to you. 

A better quote would be “before you diagnose yourself with low self esteem, be sure you are not, in fact, surrounded by assholes”.

It is in fact quite possible to be surrounded with toxic people (or at least people you don’t mesh with/people who don’t understand or appreciate you), without being an asshole yourself.
