LPT: Around 18 and having problems at home? Kicked out, running away, or abuse/neglect? The US funds a $300 million dollar Runaway and Homeless Youth Program with our taxes. Assistance could just be advice over the phone all the way to shelter, food, clothing, life skills, and housing help.

A state by state list is here: [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grants/fysb-grantees](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grants/fysb-grantees)Just click the state and then click Runaway and Homeless Youth in blue.

The real value of the places outside of the material support they provide is that they've been there! Wondering what happens if you runaway at 17 years old in a specific state when you're being neglected? They know! Did you just move to a new state and are considering reporting abuse by your parents but don't know what the foster care system looks like in you new state? They do! Can you open a bank account without a parent, etc. - they likely know! They also take calls from siblings, parents, extended family, kinship placements, child welfare workers, etc.

**There are 5 very important services funded by the RHY program.**

**Basic Center Program:** Shelter program which includes counseling, trauma-informed care, life skills, and other help. Usually for kids under 18, depends on the state.

**Maternity Group Home Program:** Shelter for youth with kids, must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, child development, parenting help, budgeting, nutrition, etc.

**Transitional Living Program:**  Must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, job help, nutrition, budgeting ,etc.

**Street Outreach Program:** My favorite program. Outreach workers meet youth where they are at on the streets, in parks, etc. These outreach workers adjust to whatever level of support you need- they could just drop off food and warm clothes or they could help you access emergency shelter and sign up for health insurance.

**National Runaway Safeline:**  1-800-RUNAWAY or [http://www.1800runaway.org/](http://www.1800runaway.org/). They were an actual switchboard back in the day that would allow kids to contact their families if they ran away. Now they have forums on their website where thousands of kids ask a ton of questions FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD about how to be safe. They work with Greyhound to provide bus trips home for runaway youth and also do a lot of outreach around issues concerning runaway and homeless youth.  


 

In lieu of awards, please google your local youth/adult/domestic violence shelter and donate to them! Or start a group with your friends to help people out!

These are agencies in my area (Northern AZ) I fully support!
