LPT - driving on the roads is a collaborative exercise, not a competitive one.

content:
The ideal end result is that everyone using the road gets where they are going safely and in good time.

Overtaking is not an achievement. 

Someone passing you is not a problem.

You are not the arbiter of traffic.

Don't tailgate.
Don't brake check.
Leave ample room between vehicles.
Let other people merge. They aren't taking "your spot".
Learn and practice lane discipline.
Use your indicators (turn signals).
Let people pull out when it's safe to do so. 
Drive your own vehicle, you're not responsible for anyone else's.

There we go, that should save about 9 different reposts a week.
