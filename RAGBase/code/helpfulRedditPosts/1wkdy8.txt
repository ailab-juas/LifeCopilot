LPT Reminder: Due to the bystander effect, if you need someone in a crowd to call 911, don't yell "Someone call 911!" Specify a person and a characteristic "You in the red jacket! Call 911!"

content:
Due to the [Bystander Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect), if you're ever in a situation where you need someone from a crowd to call for help, simply yelling "Someone call 911!" may result in every individual assuming someone else in the crowd will make the call.

Instead, it's better to point at a specific person and name a descriptive characteristic to get them to take action. "You in the red jacket! Call 911!" would work much better.

Edit: Common responses:

1) "What if no one is wearing a red jacket? Huehue!" (/r/dadjokes is that way)

2) "I'm a paramedic / EMT / lifeguard, we're taught to do exactly this!" (Right on!)

3) "Did you just take a sociology / psychology / underwater Japanese basket weaving class? We covered this today!" (no)

4) "Just call them yourself." (Difficult if you're engaged in some sort of life-saving emergency action such as applying pressure to a wound, etc)

5) "WTF you just copied that other guy's post from earlier today! You even used his example!" (That's probably because [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1wjsg5/this_was_me_today_i_was_a_little_surprised/cf2rtn1) was my post earlier, which I decided to repost as a thread here in LPT)
