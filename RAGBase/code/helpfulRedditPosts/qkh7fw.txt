LPT: If your workplace is in the process of firing you, and they ask you to write a letter apologizing to the company, DO NOT. This is an admission of guilt and will torpedo your unemployment case.

content:
My friend worked at Wal-Mart for 7 years and when he came up for promotion they fired him officially for "using the bathroom too much." The company asked him to write a letter apologizing for it and it caused him to lose his unemployment and a judge ordered him to pay back all the unemployment he'd already gotten.

Do not say or write ANYTHING that can be construed as an admission of guilt.
