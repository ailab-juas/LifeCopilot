LPT: Try to be wise who you keep around you, it’s better to be alone than to be around people that make you feel lonely.

content:
It’s really important to try and be mindful of who you spend your time with. Being around people who don’t get you or do nothing for your self confidence, are only going to make you feel more lonely and potentially feel more clingy towards them, for that reason!

If you keep people around to feel less lonely, it’s not the right reason to keep them around and can sometimes lead you into a difficult downwards spiral

Not everyone is gifted with high self esteem, so being sure you have those around you as people who leave you feeling as good as you should is so integral to your self confidence. 

Being around the wrong people will make you feel out of place and lonely, and feeling like no one understands you can be the worst feeling.

Be alone if necessary, thrive, feel your confidence come back, be happy with who you are and the right people will come into your life naturally. You don’t owe anyone anything. 
Be good to yourself :)
