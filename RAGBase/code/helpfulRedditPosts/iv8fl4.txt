YSK: When buying something online, always try 10OFF, 15OFF, 20OFF, 25OFF, 30OFF, etc... as a coupon code, even if you’ve already tried searching coupon sites.

Why YSK: a lot of online venders set these generic coupon codes with no expiration date, and it’s an easy way to save some money. 

This has worked **a lot** for me recently, and just thought the rest of you might be able to benefit (with a little luck). Cheers!
