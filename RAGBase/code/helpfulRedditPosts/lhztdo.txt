YSK It is totally fine to want a quiet, simple life of stability. You do not have to strive to change to world; you are not selfish for that. In fact, putting yourself first is noble in itself.

Why YSK: It’s okay if you want to just read a book on the weekends or play video  games or go on hikes. it’s okay to just live. I know that sometimes we  think about all of the grand ways we can change the world and we get  down on ourselves when we feel like we don’t live up to our own  standards, but it is absolutely okay to let yourself breathe and realize  that you don’t HAVE to change the world - it’s okay to focus on  yourself.
