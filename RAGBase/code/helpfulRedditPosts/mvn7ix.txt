YSK that Succulents are the subject of a great deal of damaging and illegal trade. It can be helpful to ask vendors their sources.

Why YSK: because succulents are one of the more unique varieties of plants out there, they've become a target for "poaching." Many people think they're helping preserve the species when they purchase them, but can inadvertently hurt them if contributing to illegal supply. Some more info can be found in this piece by [Cheddar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KirP2ef1lJ0). Ultimately, it's OK to have succulents! But if we want them to stay around, it's good to spread info on best-buying habits. 

There was a post on r/interestingasfuck that showed off a living rock cactus, which is a common victim of illegal trade. Made me think I should share the video I had recently seen on it.
