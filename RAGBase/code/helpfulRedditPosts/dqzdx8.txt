YSK that there's an increasing amount of AirBnB listings are ran by scammers.

content:
Long article because writer described what happened to each guest, who was scammed, in details.  Though how they got scammed is the same. 

 Google Airbnb scam and there's probably more articles.

Edit: As far as I know the only other platform out there that is similar to Airbnb is booking.com. Both have listing of room in homes for short term rental.  I used booking.com in Europe. It was a mixed experience.  I stayed at a hotel, a hostel, and a room at a residential house. The house was the most misleading one, and the worst experience. 

For rental of the entire place, also try homeaway.com which is owned by the same company that owns vrbo, which has been around much longer than Airbnb.  

Whatever platform you use, 
1. read the reviews THOROUGHLY. 
2.check google maps for surrounding areas for indication of types of neighborhood; type of grocery stores, nearby shops and businesses; pawn shops and cash advance indicate low income neighborhood
3. parking (Stayed at nice Miami condo but parking is parking at your own risk, and paid parking is for 5 hours at a time, so you can’t park overnight or you could but you’ll have to get up in the middle of the night to feed the meter. None of that was mentioned in the listing. And I didn’t think to ask by I was a noob in major metro city,)
4. Use google street view. 
5. Check to see if there’s other listings by same owner.
6. Set expectations based on your trip; need a bed to crash or longer stay with option to cook at host’s house. Check your needs and wants and read to see if the host provides it. 

Lastly, leave reviews to help others.  That’s how I knew how to avoid some listings.
