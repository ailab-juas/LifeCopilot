YSK that giving up exercise to study more may actually be damaging to your learning.

content:
In fact, the idea that student athletes somehow are amazingly exceptional may not be accurate. The fact is, if you exercise, you produce Brain Derived Neutrophic Factor (BDNF) which helps with learning, and as an added benefit, helps with anxiety and depression!  


So don't give up your training for a few more hours of studying--you might be inhibiting yourself!
