YSK: found in 8-18% of people, occasional episodes of brief, severe, unprovoked butthole pain has a name: proctalgia fugax

content:
Potential TMI, but I’ve wondered about it for years and finally found the name of it yesterday. For years, every month or two I’ll get an episode of what feels like excruciating nerve pain that... well, feels like it’s in and around my butthole. It lasts for about 15 minutes and then completely disappears. Never seen a doctor for it because it happens uncommonly and is so brief, but the pain is really severe and I had started to wonder if I had a problem with the bottom of my spine (corresponding to the nerves that provide sensation to that area).

After an episode of this yesterday, I decided to figure this out for myself. After a little googling around, I found an almost perfect description of the experience: [proctalgia fugax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctalgia_fugax). It turns out that this is due to a spasm of the levator ani muscle and does not appear to be dangerous or progressive. There’s not much treatment for it either, but my fears that something more serious was going on were relieved.

I found it interesting that they estimate this to be fairly common, but with only 1/5 asking a doctor about it, so I decided to share this with anyone on YSK who has experienced this and wondered about it!

EDIT: WOW!! I did not expect such a robust response! Who knew so many people are walking around with their poor buttholes in occasional excruciating pain? I’m glad to have brought a sense of relief to so many people. If you experience this and you feel comfortable enough, bring it up to your doctor... let’s increase physician awareness that this is a common phenomenon!

EDIT 2: You know, on the list of topics I thought I’d be discussing when I got my first reddit gold award, rectal pain was waaaaaaaaay toward the bottom (pun intended). Thank you so much and I’m happy to help!!
