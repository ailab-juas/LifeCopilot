YSK that yelling, screaming, name-calling, etc, is not normal and rarely exists in healthy relationships.

Why YSK: If you're like me, yelling was the only form of communication in your household. What many may not realize is the impact of that kind of behavior has long term effects on one's self esteem, view of relationships, mental health (negative core self beliefs, trauma, PTSD/CPTSD, anxiety, depression, etc etc) and needs as a person. Thats why its important to stop the cycle and learn to communicate properly. Healing is definitely possible.

It doesn't matter how well they treat you after or how sincerely they apologize. It doesn't matter if they are your parents or guardians. This is not normal healthy behavior. Healthy relationships involve talking about problems and working things out. There is no hurtful name-calling or blaming things on the other person. If they are willing to call you names to get a rise out of you on purpose, how do you think that will work out with children or years down the line?

Its hard enough to find a relationship, I get it, but yelling and screaming happen when there is not enough healthy communication. 9/10 times situations that involve yelling or screaming could be solved by a calm, emotionally mature, and honest conversation.

If you know you do this, own it. Talk to a therapist about why and work on it. You will be so much happier and healthier when you can communicate your feelings through talking rather than the less effective and more hurtful mode of verbal violence
