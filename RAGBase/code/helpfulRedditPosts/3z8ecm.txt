YSK how to get rid of the 'Get Windows 10' notification

content:
After installing a few Windows 7 updates and restarting the computer, I was faced with the nagging notification.

I don't want Windows 10 and never will, I'm loving Windows 7 and it will take something a lot better than 10 to pry me away from it.

I'm sure some of you may feel the same way and want rid of the intrusive notification.

I found this and wanted to share -
