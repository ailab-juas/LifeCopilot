LPT: If using Alien Blue (on iOS), triple tap the top bar of the app (underneath the time) to switch to night mode.

Not sure if it works for Android phones but triple tapping the bar next to the back button switches to night mode. Triple tapping again switches back. 

I love night mode but found it cumbersome to have to go to settings each time so this feature is particularly helpful.
