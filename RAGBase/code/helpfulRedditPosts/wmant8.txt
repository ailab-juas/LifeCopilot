LPT: if you ever have the honor of being a best man, maid of honor, or anyone in the wedding party, prepare a “refresh bag” for the couple and hold it on you for the day.

content:
The bag can contain whatever you think they’d need to get through the day as comfortable as possible. Things like deodorant, head ache medicine, gum/mouth spray, eye drops, bandaids,  blistex are all good examples of things that might come in handy. The happy couple is most likely nervous and non stop moving and talking all day. Having those little things to help refresh them can be a huge game changer when they’re worrying about many other things. Recently did this for the groom and it came in huge handy. Mouth spray before he went down the aisle, deodorant for later in the day from non stop sweating, and once word got out I had this pack some bridesmaids needed the blistex for first time shoes worn
