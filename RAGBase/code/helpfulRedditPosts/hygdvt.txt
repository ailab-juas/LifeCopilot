LPT: When learning a new language, have a “say something!” phrase

content:
Whenever anyone found out that I was learning German as my second language their first response was always “oooo say something!” So I practiced a phrase I could say in perfect German that sounded super fancy but all I would say was “sometimes I put pickles on my sandwich” People who didn’t speak German had no idea what I said but I said it so clearly that they were always impressed!
