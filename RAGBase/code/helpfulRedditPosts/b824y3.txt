YSK: that vaccines are the least profitable area for pharma companies, and antivax claims that "they push vaccines for profits" is complete bullshit.

content:
The amount of R&amp;D that goes into a vaccine is insane and involves countless steps to get it approved by the FDA. This makes the cost (i.e risk) of making a vaccine very high. Also most vaccines are sold for relatively cheap and because they reduce disease they also reduce future drug(medical) use and reduce profits. I see a lot of antivaxxers comment on how pharama makes money on vaccination but compared to their other avenues they make nothing on vaccines. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/385214/

And even better source is this podcast "this week in Virology" expert virologists from multiple R1 universities discuss the common myths on vaccines http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-496/

And before the anti vax people start saying " you big pharam shill" and shit like that. I am not being paid by anyone to post this, just want to get the right info out there. If you think I'm completely wrong I challenge you to find 1 inaccuracy in the podcast episode I posted, if you can I will remove the post.



Edit: a lot of people are making similar comments that show people are unfamiliar with how vaccines are made/ approved so once again I have to HIGHLY RECOMMEND you listen to the podcast I linked, they address this information and they have a few other episodes on the topic that can really clarify a lot of the misinformation that seems to be common(even amung the pro vax people). The people are expert Virologists with over 100yrs of experience you can't get much better than that

Edit 2: seriously a lot of people keep bring up the same things that are addressed in the podcast i linked! before you comment LISTEN TO THE EPISODE!  http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-496/ it may be a tad long but you can speed it up, and there is a crap load of useful information that you will likely find interesting
