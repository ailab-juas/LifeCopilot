title:
YSK what to do if you find an injured or orphaned animal

content:
There  are wildlife rehabilitation organizations in every state in the U.S.  and many other places across the globe. People who find animals that  they think are injured or orphaned are often in a race against time to  connect with a wildlife rehab to help the animal. Because so many  different types of animals have such very different needs, it's nearly  impossible for people who find an animal to learn enough information at  the time of crisis to give the best aid to the animal. Often times well  intentioned people do harmful thinks that to the average person would  seem reasonable (like providing food or water to an injured animal).

The  best time to learn about what to do if you find an injured or orphaned  animal is right nowâ€”before you find it. Take some time to read up on the  different scenarios that are most common in your region, and what to do  in response. Seasons and regions are very important. Owl with broken  wing in winter in Wisconsin? A litter of baby rabbits in spring in  California? Two very different things.
