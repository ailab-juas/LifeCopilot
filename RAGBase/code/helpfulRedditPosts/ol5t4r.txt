LPT: if you know someone with bad but important news, offer to spread the word on their behalf.

content:
My mom was recently put on hospice, I managed to call three people before I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. My best friend stepped up and offered to make calls to the remaining people, and that was a godsend. 

People are always anxious to help, use the good people around you if they offer.

Edit: grammar; thanks for the love everybody, have a good night!
