title:
LPT if youâ€™re a student, reward yourself for completing big projects ahead of schedule

content:
I remember some of the best advice I got as a student was for reducing stress at the end of the semester when all those final projects are due. The advice was to save up money, and to plan to have those big final projects finished BEFORE they were due and to treat myself to a nice dinner and a movie on the nights before the due date. While everyone else was pulling an all nighter, I was finished and had already enjoyed a relaxing and fun evening. My stress levels dropped immensely, and it rewarded me for learning how to manage my time. It is some of the best advice I ever received as a student and use it to this day.
