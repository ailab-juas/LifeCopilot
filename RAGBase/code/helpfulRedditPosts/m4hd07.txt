YSK that touching your dog (Messing with their paws, looking in their ears etc.) can save their life

content:
Why YSK: Some dog owners can look at their dog while they are in the middle of a health crisis and not KNOW it is a health crisis, especially with things like dog bloat. Messing with your dog's ears, paws, tail, stomach, etc. will also help you with grooming them, as they will be used to you touching them. This also will help you notice when something is wrong. My mom spent hours with her GSD puppy just messing with him, and she knew how he acted normally vs. how he acts when he is sick/upset. This saved his life when he had dog bloat, and he is happy and healthy two years later. Get to know your dogs, and it not only will make life so much easier when grooming them, but it might also save your furry friend's life!
