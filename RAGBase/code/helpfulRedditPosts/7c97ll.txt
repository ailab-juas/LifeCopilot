title:
YSK if you're using Firefox and you keep getting prompts to "help improve it" with telemetry, an add-on called "Pioneer enrollment" was added to your browser by Mozilla and removing it will make those prompts stop.

content:
since posting just a title got it removed for "violating rule 2", the reason you should know this is because its annoying and invasive and people should know how to turn this off. there's plenty of reasons to opt out of telemetry, for example if you cant even trust big credit agencies to handle your data responsibly, why should we trust mozilla to do the same? especially if they feel the need to use underhanded tactics like installing an add-on without your consent to pester you to do it.
