YSK if you have federal student loans and your school mislead you or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws, you may be eligible for ‘borrower defense to loan repayment’. This is a discharge of some or all of your federal student loan debt.

content:
Submitting the application automatically initiates an up to 3 year forbearance while they review. My school was DeVry, roughly 1 year after submitting they’ve erased my six figure federal student loan debt and refunded all prior payments made.

Why YSK: I don’t think this is widely known. It was a huge revelation and benefit to me, hoping it might help someone else.

Edit: Ok so unlike your typical post edit, I’m actually not surprised that this has blown up. Clearly a lot of you are under the same oppressive weight of student loan debt as I was. I can tell you that if you went to DeVry in the last decade or so you almost certainly qualify for some relief, but there are other schools that have been implicated as well. Here’s a link with some good information:

And the official link to the website for applying:

I had no idea if my application would be approved when I applied, but the fact that simply applying could buy me up to 3 years of forbearance to try and get back on solid ground was enough to convince me to try. I truly hope this can help someone the way it did me, good luck to you all!
