LPT: If you’re a guy, take your suits to the tailors. It costs less than 100 bucks and just a few minutes of you being in the store. The tailor will have your suit looking bespoke, instead of like a farmer’s.

content:
I buy cheap suits and then get them tailored. Much cheaper.

You can bring your dress shirts, too.

The tailor will probably have you drop them off and then pick them up a few days/weeks later.

Edit: Three ways you can find a good tailor:

1) Search Google Maps and sort by ratings/reviews.

2) Ask someone with a nicely tailored suit where he gets his clothes tailored. People like answering questions like these, because it flatters their judgment.

3) Search Reddit for your city / a nearby city and ask the people on there for recommendations.

Edit: The farmer community is a great and honorable community.
