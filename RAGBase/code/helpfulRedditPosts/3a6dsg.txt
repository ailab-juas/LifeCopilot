YSK contrary to what many TV shows state, you do not have to wait 24 hours to file a missing persons report

If you have reason to believe someone you know is legitimately missing you have every right to phone your police department for help. You do not have to wait 24 hours before making the call.

Recently a local man went missing and people were asking for help, and I saw this misconception being spread. Fortunately the family didn't listen and called the police, and the man was found a few hours later - preparing to kill himself. He would have if they waited the next day.

Our police chief explained this to me yesterday. He also mentioned how the community should never think any information they have may not be valuable in assisting the search; the guy who phoned the police with a tip on where they might find the man told them he almost didn't bother calling because he assumed someone else would have told them.
