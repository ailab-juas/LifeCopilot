LPT: Stop apologizing for things that are not your fault.

content:
I think apologizing has been overused to the point that a real apology has lost all meaning.

Please don't apologize for:

1. Setting boundaries.
2. Learning, training, asking questions, or trying to educate yourself.
3. Other peoples' mistakes.
4. Others' inability to plan.
5. Things outside of your control.
6. Doing your job or performing work tasks.
7. Existing.

A lot of times, "thank you" works better than "I'm sorry." If it makes sense, try to keep the tonality of the exchange positive.  Example: "Sorry I'm late." &gt; "Thank you for waiting for me."

Save your "I'm sorry" for when you really do mess up. Your mental health will thank you.
