YSK: When you go to your manager with a problem, have a "draft" solution ready. Asking someone to provide feedback at an existing proposal is a lot easier than asking them to come with a first solution

content:
Why YSK: Many team leads/managers are very open to suggestions, after all, it frees them from coming up with solutions.

Do you want something done in your team/department? How would you do it? What do you actually want? A process, someone fired, someone hired, better coffee? What would you do if you had the power?So when you want something from your "superior", be sure and clear what you want. "Something done about it" without the "something" is useless and managers throw that directly to the bin.

Know what you want, and make a first proposal. Especially if it's something you want done in your team, a structure change, or a process change.

If you have a draft already, they can imagine how it would look in your mind, and they will be much more open to approve it.

You get bonus points for low cost/fast ROI.

\- involving a low number of people - aka reduced cost

\- doing it without changing priorities - aka reduced cost

EDIT: this is the best way to be noticed/promoted.

Edit 2: This blew up more than I could have hoped, thank you for your comments and awards.
