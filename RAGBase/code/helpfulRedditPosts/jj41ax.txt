LPT: If you roommate ever cooks a meal and lets you eat it with them, do all of the dishes unprompted. It's polite, shows respect for the work your roommate put into it, saves them the hassle, and makes them far more likely to do so again in the future. Cooking for them later would be a good idea.

Edit: I was the cleaner in this case, I’m not a passive-aggressive poster. It’s more of a “Hey there! Found yourself in the great position of having a roommate occasionally cooking for you? Don’t F it up by forgetting to clean!”
