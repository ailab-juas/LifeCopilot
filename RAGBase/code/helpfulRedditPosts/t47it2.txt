title:
LPT: Don't say: "That other employee did it for me though!"

content:
I have worked in food and retail for several years now and whenever this happens it puts us in danger of getting reprimanded or even fired. What I'm referring to specifically is that if we do something nice for you, like give you a discount, put some extra meat on there, or just bend the rules in general for you, if you turn around and demand the same thing from another employee you may very well get the first employee in trouble. Here's an actual example I've experienced. I used to work at a restaurant where we had to throw away all the food at the end of the night as it wasn't worth keeping it overnight. therefore, if a customer came in and it was close to closing, I'd put extra food in their bag after ringing it up, or even ring it up as a lesser item because I figured it's better than it just being tossed in the bin. However one clueless soul came in the following week and asked for the same "deal" I'd given them last time... to my manager, who promptly asked for the details of the employee and deal which lead to a stern talking to in the office. My act of rebellion against corporate wastefulness and culinary genoristy was rewarded by their entitlement getting me in trouble. So please don't ever say the title as an excuse to get the same treatment you did that one time, cause it can and will cause problems for us and we will never help you again for fear of losing our jobs. Thanks for reading and please share any other tips you may have for us behind the counter too if you'd like!
