YSK There is a new 988 Suicide/Crisis hotline staffed entirely by Native People, for Native People - Dial 988 Option 4

content:
Why YSK: Anyone in crisis should call 988 for immediate assistance 24/7. 

988 has been designated as the new three-digit dialing code that will route callers to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline

The Native and Strong Lifeline is an American Indian and Alaska Native suicide, crisis, and help line that provides culturally relevant counseling and mental health support to Indigenous peoples.

It is fully staffed and operated by Native people, so when you call 988 and choose option 4, it is answered by a Tribal Crisis Counselor who is a Tribal member and descendant closely tied to their community.

Edit: thanks for your patience yâ€™all, this applies to Washington state in the United States. I was under the impression it was national, it certainly should be.
