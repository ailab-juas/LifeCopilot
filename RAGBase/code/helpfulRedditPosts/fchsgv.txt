LPT: Buy your pots, pans, and cooking utensils from your local thrift store. Their home/decor sections are always brimming with kitchen wares in excellent shape. You'll save money and be making a more sustainable, environmentally conscious purchase.

The production and shipping of these types of items creates a massive carbon footprint, when perfectly good second-hand varieties are available for cheap right up the street.

We usually associate thrift stores with clothing, and sure - buying second hand clothing isn't for everyone. But there are very few stains on a used whisk or wok that a long soak in a hot, soapy sink can't resolve.
