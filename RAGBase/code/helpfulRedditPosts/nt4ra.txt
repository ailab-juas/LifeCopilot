You should know that for-profit schools like ITT Tech are a SCAM and you can get much better, qualified education and avoid an eternity of debt.

22 yrs old (today is actually my bday)
$42k in debt for an associates degree that holds little to no weight in society. I KNOW I'm not alone. You're better off with community college and certifications. 

[This pretty much sums it all up](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nsobh/reddit_what_is_the_single_dumbest_thing_you_have/c3bq2rj)

Edit: I just got out of work, going to enjoy. A night at a friends house, I'll answer any questions when I can, but I'm not the only person with this burden, this is a thread for all of those like me! Enjoy your night, I'm going to enjoy the rest of my 22nd bday!

Edit2: Seeing everyone come together on this matter sure is uplifting! To those who have been really successful coming out of these type of schools, I'd like to say congratulations and keep it up! To those of you who are struggling to come out on top, keep fighting!
