YSK that anything you put around or near a gravestone will one day get destroyed by a weed eater.

I work for a landscaping company and one of the sites that we work at is a graveyard. Due to its immense size, the pressure from our boss to get the job done quickly, and the unpredictability of the weed eater, things often get mangled. I've seen flowers, flags, statues, figurines, glass, mementos, stuffed animals, and a host of other items get completely ruined.  We do our best to go around the items, but it is next to impossible for us to miss every object.
From what I have seen the objects that have the best chance of surviving are:
- Items that are placed on top of the gravestone (the higher up it is the less chance it will be hit)
- Flowers that are placed inside of a vase attached to the stone.
- Larger items (Larger items are easier to spot, so it isn't difficult to get around them.  However, they are often skipped, causing the grass to grow tall around them).

I just wanted to take minute to share with Reddit, so that there may be less chance of the memento you left on your loved one's grave getting destroyed.
