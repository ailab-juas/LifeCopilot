YSK that if Spirit airlines offers you a voucher as a gesture of goodwill, it can only be used for a very small fraction of the flight price and is almost worthless.

Obviously this shouldn’t surprise anyone.. but i had a ton of my time wasted the past few days because of this and I wanted to save someone else the trouble. 

Basically, I was offered a $100 voucher for future flights that needed to be used within the next two months as an apology for the fact that one of their employees stole my expensive Bluetooth speaker out of my checked bag (yeah I’m an idiot for putting It in there and they are not legally liable but i put in a claim anyways because I’ve never had something stolen before)

Anyways i was SHOCKED when they actually sent me this voucher because it is Spirit Airlines. So i go to use the voucher on a flight and It keeps showing up as $17 instead of $100 when I went to pay for our two 70$ flights .
Spent so much time and energy going back and forth with customer service trying to figure this thing out when I finally fully read the fine print....

The voucher can only be used for tickets in YOUR NAME. Also It can only be used towards a small portion of the flight fee.... for a 70$ flight that is $17. Wow OK. Thanks for wasting my time Spirit- will never fly with them again out of principle. The speaker ? Sure that’s fine - they aren’t legally liable . But this crap with the fake voucher apology, which is really just another money grab for them really crossed the line for me .
