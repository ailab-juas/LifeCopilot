title:
YSK that some vehicle buyers change out the stock rims and tires, then sell them

content:
I ordered tires for my truck, which were about $1200. Rims look pretty ratty, about $1000 to have them refinished, and i would be without my truck for 3-4 days. Looked at the online classifieds (like craigslist) and found somebody selling the factory rims and tires from their higher trim level truck for $1250 because they put something flashier on their truck.  
They are called takeoffs, and quite common. So look around before to spend money on new tires.
