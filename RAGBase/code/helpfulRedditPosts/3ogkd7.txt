LPT: Remove the word 'just' if it doesn't add better clarity or affect the meaning of the statement

content:
Recently, I noticed after reading this [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/11721427/Women-do-need-to-man-up-and-stop-using-the-word-just.html) that I was using the word 'just' when it didn't affect then meaning of the statement. 

I know there is some [backlash](http://www.bustle.com/articles/94852-former-google-executive-ellen-petry-leanse-says-women-should-stop-saying-just-and-shes-kind-of) to the above thinking.  My concern is not the politically correctness here. I noticed I wasn't using it as a clarifier and so I've tried to remove 'just' where necessary. 

Example:

Affects the meaning: "I just got home."

Doesn't affect the meaning: "I just wanted to touch base with you."

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great comments and suggestions. I love your jokes. What a great response!**
