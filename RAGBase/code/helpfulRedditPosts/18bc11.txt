LPT: Play the game as early as possible. Make connections in college with professionals and academics every chance you get because it's all about who you know.

Getting a job is all about who you know. Network every chance you get. Play the game. You're at a party? Put on a smile, give a nice handshake and start talking to people. Your friend who works at the company will get you an interview before your shining transcript or summer internship experience will. The truth is, aside from a quick glance over, employers don't really look at your resume, and more often today companies use algorithms to screen people out before a human will even give that glance over. 

Its never gonna be as easy as when you're in college. You're surrounded by experts in their field typically with industry connections. You want quality references, you want to have friends in high places. Your college professors, parent's friends, professionals at seminars, guy on the train, whatever. Make this a life long skill beyond getting that initial job, and you're destined for success.
