title:
YSK that if you get asked wether you plan on having kids during a job interview, you can just say No. Since the question is illegal in most places, nothing will happen if you do end up having kids.

A German law professor once told me women can lie and say no to that question, since it is illegal. Because if you refuse to answer you kinda tip them off that that is a sensitive topic and you are possibly thinking about it.  

So just say no, what are they gonna do? If get hired and end up having kids, you clearly can't be legally held responsible for lying (haha imagine that), you get maternity leave and benefits (in most countries) and in terms of the relationship with you boss you just say:  A miracle baby! An accident! You changed your mind!

Why YSK: Asking questions about family planning is illegal during job interviews. Women get asked about this a lot, leading to discriminatory hiring practises. Since answering this question can be tricky, just saying "no, I don't want kids in the near future /ever / I am focusing on my career right now/ I can't have children" is the optimal solution.
