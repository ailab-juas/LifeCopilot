LPT: Have a bunch of photo's stuck together use Glycerin and Water

content:
My wife used this last night and i was shocked how well it worked.  Use 2 tablespoons glycerin to what looked like 1 qt of water. Soak pictures, gently move them around, then gently try to separate. 

Photobooth techs told us the pictures should just be thrown away, father in law ran a camera shop for years shared this tidbit with us.
