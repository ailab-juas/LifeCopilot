LPT: If you always forget things when you leave somewhere, develop a pocket-pat routine.

Keys, wallet, work phone, personal phone.  

I have mild ADHD, the inattentive type, so getting out of the door with all the things I need for the day can be hard.  If it's a long day and I need to bring a lunch or other items with me for the day, sometimes it gets even harder to keep track of the 6-10 items I need to bring with me to get through the day.  I can't tell you how many times I've left a lunch on the counter, but successfully remembered to bring a piece of paper that I need to fax at work.  Every time I walk out the front door of work/home, I check to make sure I've got the basic 4 I've listed above.  

Edit: I forgot something, big surprise right?  If you're leaving the house and you get the vague thought "I'm forgetting something" but can't remember what it is, just stand there for a second and figure it out.  It'll usually come to me.  Noticing that thought has saved me a bunch of times.  Usually this happens when I've got something out of the ordinary that I've got to bring with me.  Like I was in the shower thinking about my day and I was like "I've got to get a haircut, make sure to grab a check off the desk" and then I get wrapped up in getting all my shit together and feeding a baby and trying to iron a shirt and I barely make it out the door and I've mostly forgot about the check. Then I hear that little thought that I've forgotten something.
