LPT: Don't show fear to spiders and other kinds of harmless animals in front of your kids so they won't have anxienty as adults.

content:
This is only helpful in countries where spiders and so on are not dangerous of course.

So while this tip is bad advise in Australia, it's a good thing for kids in Middle-Europe to handle encounters with them as adults and not panick, like I spectated it many times.
