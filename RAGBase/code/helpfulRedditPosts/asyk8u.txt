YSK if you’re an iPhone user and are sick of apps constantly asking you to “give feedback”, you can easily disable this

content:
Settings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Store &gt; turn off “In-App Ratings &amp; Reviews”

Because constantly getting that “HOW ARE WE DOING?” Pop up linking to leave a review in almost every app gets annoying
