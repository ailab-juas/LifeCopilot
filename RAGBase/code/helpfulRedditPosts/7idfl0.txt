YSK: Costco has Dental Plans

content:
$90 a year. Free exams, cheap cleanings, $80 fillings, etc. They set the prices ahead of time so they’re fixed and cheap. My manager told me about them today. Full disclosure, I haven’t gone in to learn more, but it sounds lime a really good deal. If that’s not your bag, or you don’t have Costco, you can often get free cleanings at dental colleges.

EDIT: Program available to Costco members in AZ, CA, FL, MD, NV, OR, PA, TX and WA
