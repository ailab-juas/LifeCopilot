YSK about Zinc for common colds. &gt;75-mg daily, and it has to be zinc acetate. "A meta-analysis of 13 placebo-controlled trials suggests your cold will be 42% shorter in duration"

**"If you take Zinc acetate lozenges in daily doses of over 75 mg within 24 h of common cold symptoms, a meta-analysis of 13 placebo-controlled trials suggests your cold will be 42% shorter in duration.[1]"**

"This study shows strong evidence that the zinc lozenge effect on common cold duration is heterogeneous so that benefit is observed with high doses of zinc but not with low doses."[1]

"Take zinc acetate not zinc gluconate. Zinc acetate appears to have a much stronger effect than gluconate. "Three trials used **zinc acetate in daily doses of over 75 mg**, the pooled result indicating a **42% reduction in the duration of colds** (95% CI: 35% to 48%). Five trials used zinc salts **other than acetate** in daily doses of over 75 mg, the pooled result indicating a **20% reduction in the duration of colds** (95% CI: 12% to 28%)."[1]"

So basically most forms of zinc lozenges make colds 20% shorter, if and only if you take more than 75 mg a day. **For the 42% reduction mentioned in the title it sadly has to be zinc acetate.** Also dosage matters: a number of trials looked at doses of less than 75 mg per day and found that didn't significantly work.

Zinc acetate in the 13 trials they looked at made colds 42% shorter.

You should also know: Don't use zinc nose sprays. Can cause you to lose your sense of smell (!). http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/30/AR2006013001240.html
