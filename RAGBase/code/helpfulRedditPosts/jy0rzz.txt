LPT: Give consumable gifts so it won't become clutter

content:
I'll bet we have all been given an object that sits around our house for years since we can't throw it away because it was a gift. 

If you don't know of something specific to gift, keep in mind consumables like soap, lotion, teas, snacks, candles, etc. They can enjoy it and be done with it!
