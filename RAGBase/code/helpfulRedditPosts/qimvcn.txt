LPT: Ask people with illnesses if you can come visit rather than telling them you're coming to visit them.

I'm going through a very serious and scary health problem currently that required a major surgery less than a month ago that followed another surgery just three weeks prior to that, and yet I have still not had a chance to recover and be at peace because I have to constantly worry about visitors flying in to stay for a week or two "to help". 

Every visitor says "don't entertain me, I'm coming to help"...but the thing is, they DO need to be entertained, and they can't help because they need instructions constantly, and even when I'm feeling horrible, it's impossible to not feel pressured to play perfect host, that's not in my nature and I can't just "get over" feeling that way, no matter how awful I feel I still have to step up. 

In a few days my mother in law will be the latest person coming "to help", which means I can't spend my last days of sanctioned medical leave to recover in bed in my pajamas watching what I want, reading what I want, and being at ease in my sanctuary. Instead I have to prepare the guest room and clean to my standard for guests, and I'll bow to the pressure every day to be up, awake, and showered with full hair, makeup, and completely dressed by 8 am so I can sit with her in the living room waiting for her to declare when it's time to eat breakfast, or go out to lunch, or to go out to dinner at 4 pm, all while pretending to feel fine when I just want to sleep, cry, or vomit, and watch trash TV or listen to crappy music that only I enjoy. 

I'm losing my sanctuary, my healing place, and I'm not being given a choice that allows me any room for honesty without looking like a total isolationist dick to well wishers.
