LPT: When emailing a resume to a prospective employer, avoid sending it as a word (doc/docx) document.

content:
Send it as a pdf. This helps hide any spelling and grammatical errors, when the resume is opened in a pdf reader, that would otherwise show up if the resume is opened in Microsoft Word. If you've missed the error, there is a good chance the person reading your resume will miss it as well.  Everyone makes mistakes. We are human after all.
