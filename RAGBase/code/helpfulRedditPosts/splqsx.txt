LPT Don't get overwhelmed by perfection or nice looking but arbitrary figures when shooting for goals. Do 17 pushups, save $138.93, read 1/3 of a chapter, but keep moving.

When approaching tasks, errands, projects, etc., somehow, my instinct is to throw the thought of doing it at all out the window, rather than do what's possible or even just easy. The thought of not having time to completely clean my room, may deter me from making my bed, which would go a long way to make the room clean, inspiring me to actually finish it. 

I have been trying to get back into the gym regularly too. When I do make the trip, especially if I haven't been in a while and my usual reps are hard to achieve to the point of not achieving my initial goal, I can still say to myself "Dammit, I went". 

That may sound a little pathetic and being content with mediocrity, but it's usually a step in the right direction far enough that I'll want to go the next day too. 

I've been putting away $75 a week for a few months. Times are tough right now, but instead of saying "Eh, I just won't invest this week" I'll put $25 away, even though it's miniscule. The value might change but the mindset does not. 

As dumb as it sounds, I say to myself "Something is something, and nothing is nothing." 

Because truly, doing something incompletely, is better than doing completely nothing.

Edit: I am truly humbled by everyoneâ€™s thoughts and feelings regarding my post. If one person takes one step closer toward their goals that makes me happier than I can put into words!
