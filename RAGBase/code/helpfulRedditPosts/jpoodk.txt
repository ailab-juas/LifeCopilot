YSK: In case of an emergency give directions to specific people instead of generally saying it for everyone and expecting someone to do it!

Why YSK: In an emergency situation, don't yell "somebody get help/call an ambulance/get me something to stop the bleeding!". Give the direction to an individual, most people will expect someone else to do it. If you say "you, call an ambulance, you in the red, get me a cloth/shirt" bystanders are FAR more likely to actually move and take direction. If you're a group that's trained and practiced most people will respond to "somebody" but if they aren't, everyone expects someone else to take charge and take responsibility. Be that person and give individual directions.
