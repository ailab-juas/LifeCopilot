LPT: Draw your shower curtains after getting out of the shower to avoid mold build-up.

content:
Was at a friends who just bought new shower curtains because the old ones got a lot of that black mold built up.

I told him that he should draw (pull out) the curtains so they can dry properly to avoid the problem. He was kind of surprised, so I thought I would share.

Also, it gives the washroom a more organized look when you don't see all the soap bottles lining the edge of he tub. :p
