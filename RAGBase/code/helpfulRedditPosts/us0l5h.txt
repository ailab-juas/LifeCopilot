LPT: Fill a spray bottle with 10% Dawn dish soap and 90% water. You now have an incredibly effective and cheap multipurpose cleaner.

I discovered this recently. Take any spray bottle, empty it out and then add a 10% Dawn (I prefer Platinum) and 90% water. This spray can be used on windows, counters, toilet, floors and is really all purpose. 

It works wonders for soap scum in the bathtub if you let it sit too. You can also do this trick with concentrated liquid like Simple Green. Save some money, make this spray. A bottle of this will last a while since its so potent.
