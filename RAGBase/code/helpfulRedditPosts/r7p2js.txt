YSK that button batteries (the batteries that look like coins) of swallowed can burn the inside of a persons esophagus and is a life threatening emergency.

Why YSK: children find these batteries and swallow them. We especially see these batteries around the holidays as they are in decorations, cards, toys and all sorts of other things. I work as a nurse and have seen several children need to be tube fed for the rest of their lives and/or have permanent vocal damage. Please keep items with button batteries up and away from toddlers and young children. And if it does happen (happens to the best parents so don't freak out) get your kid to the emergency room immediately. If the x-ray shows a "coin with a halo" get your kid into surgery asap.
