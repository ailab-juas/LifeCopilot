LPT: For those in flooded areas, use extreme caution when walking on streets and sidewalks. Manhole covers are often forced off by the flood and can be extremely dangerous as people can fall in, get trapped, and drown.

Iâ€™m from New Orleans where flooding is common. Rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood). It creates underground rivers and people fall in and drown. 

Use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.

Another thing to consider are keeping food, water and an axe with you if forced to move to a higher level of your home. Many people got stuck and even drowned in their attics during katrina but the people who brought axes could cut through to their roofs.
