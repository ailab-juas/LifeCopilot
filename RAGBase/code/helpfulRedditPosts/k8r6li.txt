LPT delete your social media apps from your phone. Use the web version instead

content:
Social media is fun and a great tool for many things, although it can consume huge chunks of your time.   

The apps are designed to keep you on them for as long as possible.  
Donâ€™t try to compete with it, because you will eventually lose.   

Just delete the app, and use the web version on your phone which is much less optimized. 

Also huge privacy improvement!
