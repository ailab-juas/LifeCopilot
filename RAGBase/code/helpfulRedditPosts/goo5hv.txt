LPT: From here on out, make "What was your company's COVID response?" a standard interview question.

content:
I work in software. My whole company has been working from home for the past two months, and performing at 100%. Now management is forcing us all to come back into the office on June 1st, for no discernible reason.

I don't want to work for a company that cares so little about the health of employees and their families, ever again. I'll be looking for something new as soon as it's practical, and I will definitely be asking prospective employers this.

EDIT: Unsubscribing from replies now because I can't keep up with them. Thanks, all, a lot of good responses here! And a few weirdos who are somehow personally offended by the very *idea* of asking an interviewer about working conditions. Reddit is a strange place.
