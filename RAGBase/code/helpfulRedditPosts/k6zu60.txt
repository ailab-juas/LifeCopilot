title:
LPT: if you drop your kids off at school in the morning (mine are 9 and 7 years old), play a “walk on song” ( like pro wrestlers get) for them before they get out of the car. The kids get excited for their day and start with a great attitude.

Today it was “Elevate” from the “Into the Spiderverse” soundtrack. They were fired up.

Edit: thanks for all of the awards! I just like to think up things to make my girls smile

Also, kiddos’ school is 7 miles away on a highway, not really walkable for 9 year old girls, the songs change daily, and it won’t last forever, but the happy memories will. After all: I still play hide and seek, legos, dolls, etc with my kids when they ask, I don’t expect that to work when they’re older. 

Just finding small ways to enhance life, especially in these times.
