title:
LPT: When punishing younger children for something, discuss with them what they have done wrong before giving any punishment. This gives them an explanation and re-enforces some rules that you might not make as clear as others, along with making them feel more understood.

content:
If you can, don’t punish them on the first offense either. If they really didn’t know what they were doing wrong, give them a second chance.
