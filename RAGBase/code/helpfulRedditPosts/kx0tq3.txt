LPT:If you fear public speaking, always ask to go first. Going last just means you are going to suffer in fear and anticipation the whole time without any benefit to you or the outcome of your presentation.

content:
If you present first, you can relax for the rest of the time. No one is going to be as harsh on your presentation because there's nothing and no one to compare it to. You also won't be the last presentation on everyone's minds because you went so early on. Sitting in fear won't help you prepare for your presentation at all and will only cause you to overthink.
