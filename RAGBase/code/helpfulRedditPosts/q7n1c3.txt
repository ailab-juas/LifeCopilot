YSK An unexplained black eye in a young child is a symptom of cancer

content:
**Why YSK** Neuroblastoma is a relatively common cancer in children less than ~5 years old. Of children who die from cancer about 15% of those deaths are due to neuroblastoma. *Early detection greatly increased survival rates*. 


The cancer causes a protein or a hormone (I can’t seem to find the exact mechanism) that causes dark circles around the eyes. This can look like your child has a black eye.


Please go see a doctor immediately if you see this in your child. [Here is a link](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/neuroblastoma-childhood/symptoms-and-signs) for more information and other symptoms.



A little one in my life was diagnosed with this cancer and the first symptom was a black eye.


Edit: just for clarity, an unexplained black eye is a symptom of neuroblastoma, but it’s not the only cause of an unexplained black eye. I probably should have worded my title differently.
