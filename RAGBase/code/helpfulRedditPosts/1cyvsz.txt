LPT: Can't decide on dinner? Use the "veto rule"

content:
This brilliant little rule is used in my house often. I guarantee success.

Scenario (written by /u/natesays in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1cxqt4/lpt_when_your_partner_asks_you_a_question_and_you/c9l2o32)):

**WITHOUT** the veto rule:

&gt;Me: Want to grab some Pizza?

&gt;Her: I don't care.

&gt;Me: What about burgers?

&gt;Her: I don't care.

&gt;Me: We could grab some chicken tenders...

&gt;Her: I don't care.

&gt;Me: OK, let's get the pizza then.

&gt;Her: I don't want pizza.

&gt;Me: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻


Instead of this happening, you institute the veto rule, which means that **anyone who vetoes a suggestion has to pay for that veto with a suggestion of their own**. This keeps it from becoming lopsided.

**WITH** the veto rule:

&gt;Me: Want to grab some Pizza?

&gt;Her: Veto. Mexican?

&gt;Me: Nope, sounds awful. What about burgers?

&gt;Her: Nah. Chicken Tenders?

&gt;Me: Agreed.

No tables harmed.

**Edit:** since this blew up, I'll mention something many commenters have as well: 

The **Pick Three Rule** (or 5-3-1 or some other variation). 

Someone suggests 2-5 options, the other vetoes some of them, and the original person chooses from the survivors. 

*Optional rule:* if the second person vetoes all suggestions, they must re-suggest an equal number of options in return.

Also, here's how you can make the ramen variation I mentioned:

1. Put a bit less than 2 cups of water in a pot and boil it. 
2. Add ramen. Fuck the little packet of powder, you can toss that. 
3. Set timer to 3:33 for the noodles (it's quick to enter on the microwave). The next few steps are done while the noodles cook. 
4. Prepare eggs and sauce. Crack 2-3 eggs in a bowl. Leave them alone. 
5. Put a dollop (trial and error for amount) of peanut butter in another bowl--the one you'll eventually eat out of--and cover that shit with sriracha sauce. Mix it up with a fork, and you should have a nice paste (not too thick). Start with a little bit of peanut butter and a little sriracha; you can always add more of both, but you can't take it away. 
6. Noodles are done. **Leave the heat on high.** 
7. Add eggs, one at a time, stirring them into the noodles. Once it starts to "boil" again, add another egg. 
8. Finish cooking until eggs look done (1-2 min. maximum).
9. [Optional] drain remaining water. I don't like soupy ramen, but this is up to you.
10. Add egg noodle stuff to the bowl of spicy peanut paste. Stir, add more sriracha to taste, and enjoy this delicious meal. 

Total prep time is about 10 min, which includes cleaning up after.
