LPT: Own a stand alone camera, like a Gropro/DSLR? Take a picture of your contact information and never delete it. If you ever lose your camera, the person who finds it will know how to find you.

I've seen too many posts along the lines of "It might be a long shot but does anyone recognize this person? I found their camera." If you take a picture of your name/address/phone number on every SD card you use, you'll have a much greater chance of having your camera returned to you!
