LPT: Absolutely do not, under any circumstances, touch a dog without the owner’s express permission, even if it “seems friendly” to you. You don’t know how that dog feels about strangers or if the dog has any medical conditions that would cause it to react aggressively on a dime. It’s not worth it.

Speaking from experience, my own dog has a painful skin condition that causes him to reflexively bite at anything trying to touch him in certain spots. Yes, he’s the most adorable golden pupper in the world, but if you run up on him trying to grab him you will get chomped, as has happened twice before. If you had asked me ahead of time I could have informed you to kindly leave him alone.

Please respect other people’s pets.
