LPT: If you need to leave immediately and have no time to pack clothes due to a natural disaster, abusive SO, or whatever reason just grab your dirty laundry hamper.

content:
Years ago my siblings and I were taken from my parents due to child abuse/neglect, and my grandparents were the ones getting us with Child Protective Services. My grandmother went and saw that our laundry baskets were full so she just grabbed that as she wanted to get us out of there ASAP. Her logic, all the dirty clothes are things we chose to wore, and cleaning them would take a few hours, but in this moment it takes a minute to just grab them. If we were to try and pack our clothes, it would just extend the amount of time we would be in that toxic situation of crying, yelling, and screaming. Luckily my brother was a stickler for laundry and had gotten each of us our own basket. Older siblings, and grandparents are the best.

I've remembered that ever since, and every time I've needed to leave in an immediate hurry and didn't have time to pack for whatever reason but would have time to clean the clothes later, laundry basket. I've told this story for 18 years to people, and I can count on both hands off the top of my head the amount of times someone told me this actually came in handy. I've been told of abusive relationships, emergency evacuation situations, and several other random situations that required the gathering of clothes immediately.

I happened to remember this due to having a dream about that incident, and don't recall anyone sharing this tip. It surprisingly saves a lot of time, hassle and effort if you don't mind working a little later. Worst case scenario most people wear a piece of clothing once and stick it in the dirty clothes basket, technically you can get away with wearing something again in an emergency. Whatever works.

**EDIT!!!: I thank you all for the awards, the gesture is appreciated, however you should donate to a non profit that helps during abuse situations, or natural disaster reliefs or something of that nature.** [**Here's a list of child abuse/neglect non profits.**](https://www.childwelfare.gov/organizations/?CWIGFunctionsaction=rols:main.dspList&amp;rolType=Custom&amp;RS_ID=75&amp;rList=ROL) **There's also a nice list** [**here for non profits that help out in natural disaster relief as well.**](https://www.galaxydigital.com/blog/disaster-relief-organizations/)

**Please consider donating to these non profits rather than giving me an award, I thank you for the consideration, but your money can be better spent towards these organizations of your choosing. Thank you!**
