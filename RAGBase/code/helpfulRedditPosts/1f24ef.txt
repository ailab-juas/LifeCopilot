LPT: if a stranger joins a social situation, immediately - and familiarly - fill them in

content:
I've found this is really great when I'm at a friend or romantic interest's house and his or her roommate (whom I've never met) comes home. I just turn around and say "hi, we're baking" or "hey, we're watching [this movie], have you seen it?" You immediately open the door for colloquial conversation with them, and avoid that awkward "we know of each other but never speak" relationship. Similarly, it's just great to be included when you come into a new space. I've made lots of friends just by being accommodating like this.
