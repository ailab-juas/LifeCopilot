LPT: Have a wood screw that is loose such as on a door hinge, drawer knob, etc, take a toothpick and put it in the hole the screw goes to, snap off the excess sticking out, and put the screw in again. It should tighten right up again for you.

Edit: I should add that when I say door hinge, I’m talking cabinet doors like in the kitchen or bathroom, or at most interior bedroom doors. A toothpick isn’t going to hold an exterior entry door. I wrote the initial post with little fixes in mind and thinking of what pretty much every household probably has on hand. 

As a bunch of these comments are stating, wood glue will give a better hold when combined with the toothpick, matchstick, or splinter of choice. I’ve never been a golfer, but will have to pick up a few golf tees for the toolbox after seeing a bunch of these comments, so thank you guys for that!

Thanks for blowing this post up everyone!  I saw a good handful of people who are going to be using these tricks in the near future, so Reddit saves the day thanks to all of you!!!
