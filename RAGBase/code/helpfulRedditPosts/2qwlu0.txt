LPT: To make cheap vodka more palatable or good vodka smoother than it ought to be, run it through a BRITA filter 2 to 4 times.

Simple as the title says. My source was the owner of a distillery in my town. Last night I tried it with three different vodkas of varying quality and created a taste test for friends. The filtered vodka was chosen every single time without hesitation.

And if you drink your vodka, or any type of alcohol, in conjunction with N-acetyl cysteine capsules (can buy cheaply on Amazon), most can kiss the possibility of a hangover goodbye.

I wish I knew these both 10 years ago....

Edit: You can filter more than four times. It's your damn vodka. Do as you please.

Edit 2: I just messaged the owner of the distillery to see what he could add to this. He said to get a seperate BRITA pitcher that you don't use for water. As far as the filters breaking down, he said a lot of that is due to "certain sugars" and the glycerin added to all commercial vodkas (it's what gives it its viscosity if you didn't know). Of course the hardest part on the filter is the alcohol itself because alcohol is ~~poison~~ a solvent. He explained that it's critical to get water through the filter after the 2-4 passes as quickly as possible. He said with proper care and cleaning of the filter right after, there is no reason you shouldn't be able to get 3-5 handles through it depending on how many times you filter. If you use glycerin free vodka (like he makes), the filter will hold up for another handle or two.

Edit 3: This is not cost effective everywhere and I did not consider this when posting. This is cost effective in NY, but not CA, as an example.
