YSK that healthcare providers will often say they "accept" your insurance, but that does not mean they are "covered."

Just experienced this first hand, and got a surprise $400 bill for a 20 minute appointment from a place that told me they take my insurance. Apparently it's "common knowledge" that you have to confirm everything with your insurance company, but it wasn't common enough for me, so I thought others might benefit from learning that for whatever reason it seems legal for healthcare providers to mislead customers in this way. In my case I even paid a copay when I left the office, which I thought for sure meant that the rest would be covered by insurance, and walked out without seeing any other charges. Now 7 months later I see they sent an invoice to my insurance company, Humana, but that Humana denied payment.

Being "in network" does not mean you're covered either, by the way. Always, always, always check with your insurance company to confirm not just that the **agency** you're going to is covered, and not just the **doctor** that you're seeing, but also each and every **procedure** they are doing, and each and every **specialist** that is being called in or that you're being sent to in order to enact those procedures.

It seems like an impossible standard for most laypeople to meet, but apparently the responsibility is not on doctors or clinics to even know if they're covered by a certain insurance policy, which seems bizarre to me coming from the mental health field where we have to know that stuff before we even  set an appointment with the client.
