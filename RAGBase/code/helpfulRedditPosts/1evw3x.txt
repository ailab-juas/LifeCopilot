LPT: To avoid a collision with someone walking the opposite way, immediately pick a side and stare towards it.

I find that if you make eye-contact, you both get confused, and end up doing that awkward, bemused shuffle from side-to-side. And even if it looks like they're not going to change course, maintain yours. Dominating confidence and shit.

Nine out of ten times, it works every time.
