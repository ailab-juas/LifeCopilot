YSK that if you’ve attached your bank account to Venmo/Robinhood/Betterment, a company called Plaid is recording all your bank account activity.

**Why YSK**
When you attach your account to these services using Plaid, they **store your bank account password and log into your account** periodically to download your entire activity. They know how much you make, how much you spend, etc.


**Why now?**
On August 9th, Plaid settled $58M lawsuit over data sharing: https://finledger.com/2021/08/09/plaid-settled-58-million-lawsuit-over-alleged-consumer-data-sharing/

The lawsuit makes it clear that Plaid does not explain what kind of data it collects and how frequently it collects it.

They’ve also been sued by banks:
