LPT: If you're a business owner, keep a vector file of your logo handy

content:
You will avoid any problems when sending your logo off for promotional purposes such as printing t-shirts, banners, etc. I work for a marketing company, and the amount of poor quality JPEG's of logos I get is absurd. If you've paid to have a logo designed, you should have a vector file of it yourself.
