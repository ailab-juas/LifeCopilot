[YSK] There's a bot on reddit that will remind you about anything you ask it too

[Just learned about this last night](http://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/)

It's called the RemindMeBot and you can have it remind you about something up to a year later. just post a comment summoning the bot and he'll be sure to send you a PM whenever you ask it to. This guy deserves some more credit for this.

EDIT: I hope the creator sees this and is inspired to do some more in-depth development, adding shorter time frames and more time stuff, beyond just days or hours, like weeks or months.
