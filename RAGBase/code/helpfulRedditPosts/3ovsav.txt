LPT: Stinky water bottle/Nalgene? Use hot water and baking soda to get rid of the funk smell

content:
I had bought a new Nalgene bottle to keep at work recently, and even though I was only using water in the bottle, it developed a bad smell that persisted through washings and soakings.

I didn't have any vinegar (which also supposedly works) and tried using 3-4tbs of baking soda and hot water. I left the cap on and would shake the water occasionally. A few hours later, voila, my bottle is as neutral smelling as ever!
