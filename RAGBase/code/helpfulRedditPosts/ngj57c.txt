LPT: Courtesy of my Dad - if you need to remember something, do a weird thing that you'll question later. I have early memories of asking "what do you need to remember Dad?" every time I saw his watch upside down on his wrist. Simple and effective!

This works especially well overnight. If you're almost asleep but have to do something in the morning, put your phone on the floor. Need to book a dentist appointment? Put your toothbrush next to the kettle. Change your phone background to a pic of your mom if you keep forgetting to call her. Put on your undies inside out. Just set up any "what the fuck" trigger for later, preferably a relevant, well-timed one, and this will work for you. 

You can stealthily involve other people in your triggers too. Need to talk to someone at work but they've left for the day? Put something of yours on their keyboard and they'll come right to your desk first thing in the morning.

I've found this works better than making lists or sending emails because those take a second step of requiring you to actually find and read them later. Something jarring and unfamiliar is much harder to overlook and ignore. 

Anyone doing this already, who can share their weird little rituals?
