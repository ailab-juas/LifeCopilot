LPT: Don’t use words that you don’t completely, totally, understand in a professional setting like work or school.

content:
The risk of misusing words cannot be understated. As you speak, even if you are tempted, do not use any words that you don’t fully and completely understand. People around you may not correct you, and they will judge and remember. Your credibility is on the line every time you speak, especially in professional settings, so if you don’t completely understand a term, word, phrase, etc. then be sure to fully research it before attempting to use it in a sentence.
