YSK If your car lease is ending soon, the residual value in your contract is probably much less than the value of your car. Basically, you will have equity at the end of your lease.

Why YSK: The used car market was way different 3 years ago, used cars are typically now worth much more, So when you leased a car back then, they most likely calculated an end-of-lease value MUCH lower than what your car is worth today. Also if you ended up working from home, your mileage is probably less than the max allowance in your contract...

**You are potentially sitting on a 5-10K+ equity on the car.**

The dealership KNOWS this and will try its best to hide this from you and lure you into another lease. Be smart and look up your contract...**You have the right to buy it back at the residual value**. If you sell it on your own, you can make a nice profit.

Update:

I wasn't expecting so much interest in this post...I just want to point out that I'm no expert, just a guy who did his homework and planning to buy back my lease. This might vary depending on when your lease originated. Don't take my word, this is just for anyone to be aware... do some research to see if this also applies to you.

A few things to point out as many of you mentioned, this is for car leases in the US (maybe also in Canada?), but it might not apply to some of you in the UK or other countries.

If you want to buy it back, call the financial company you leased from, they will tell you the exact buyback amount as opposed to the dealer who will try to get you back in the office, you might be able to do all transactions directly with them to avoid the dealership shenanigans.

Verify the law in the state you're in regarding taxes. I live in Texas and taxes are paid fully when you originate the lease, you do not have to pay taxes again when you buy it out (another good reason to buy it back) Keep in mind this might be different in other states.

One last thing, the used car market is changing fast, this might not be relevant 6 months from now.

I hope this helps!
