LPT: All undergrad/grad students, save your syllabi!

content:
Regardless if you're an undergraduate or graduate student, you should save/keep a copy of every syllabus for every class you take. Many people think that the college/university they enroll in will be the one they graduate from, but life happens and things change. When it comes time to transfer and your new institution says they won't transfer the credit over, supplying them with a copy of the syllabus for that class can get you the credit. Easier to save a syllabus than to take a class again that you already passed. 

Edit: A lot of people are giving me grief saying that you can contact your previous school and get copies. Why waste your time (calling your previous university, finding the right person to speak to, waiting for the documents to get to you, etc.) when you can have your own copy on file and send it? Honestly...I think you're lazy if you don't want to "bog yourself down" with paper. Scan them and save them on your computer if it's that big of a deal.
