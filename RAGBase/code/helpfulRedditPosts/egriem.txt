title:
YSK how to properly set goals. Lots of new year's resolutions will get abandoned because they are not set up for success.

content:
S.M.A.R.T. is a popular acronym/method that significantly improves your chances of achieving your goal.

Specific - instead of saying, "I want to lose weight this year", set a specific weight. "I want to lose 25 lbs by 2021"

Measurable - 25 lbs is the goal and you can see your progress along the way

Achievable - 25 lbs is something one could do without significant risk to their health (depending on their weight)

Realistic/Relevant - Can you do it? Is it worth the time?

Time oriented - "I want to lose 10 lbs by month 6, 15 by month 8, 25 by 12".
