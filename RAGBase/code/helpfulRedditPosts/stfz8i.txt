LPT Foaming soaps are just the 1/3 of the original product diluted with 2/3 water at the same price as original. You can make your own foam solution, and put it in a new foaming pump dispenser or repurpose a used one.

Edit... Due to some companies screwing you more, sometimes you may need to dilute up to 4/5 water to 1/5 product.
