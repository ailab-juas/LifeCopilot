LPT: If you tend to feel lost in life, occasionally set aside an hour to be utterly alone with your thoughts. You might think that you take 'me time' while listening to music, podcasts, YouTube, etc., but all of that just diverts your stream of consciousness and keeps you from reflecting on yourself

content:
I did this for years: jumping from external input to external input.  Every minute between family time, work and friends was also filled with *something*. Every commute and every minute before bed was used to listen to or watch *something*. Even when I spent entire weekends alone, there was always some video/stream/music/... on to engage my focus.

This is just not healthy. Give yourself the room to actually think. Listen to your inner monologue and see where it takes you. This can be unpleasant, especially if you maybe have to work through some stuff. But drowning out your own thoughts day after day is not the solution.

Credit where credit is due: I read a similar tip here on Reddit years ago by a young father who snuck out of bed late at night to just sit alone and think. I hope he and his family are doing good. I took his advice to heart and it changed my life for the better
