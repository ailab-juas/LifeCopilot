Why YSK: You donâ€™t need a clinic. You can take care of yourself safely and anonymously [HERES A LINK](https://nwhn.org/safe-online-delivered-how-to-get-the-abortion-pill-by-mail/) Please share this openly and often. The pill can be taken up until the 10th week of pregnancy.

Edit: I am humbled and nearly moved to tears to see so much concern and compassion here. Thank you all for being good people and PLEASE do your best to make this common knowledge!!! Gotta look out for each other!
