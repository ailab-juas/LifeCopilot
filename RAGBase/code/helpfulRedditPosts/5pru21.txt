LPT: If someone doesn't smile much or ever, don't let the first thing you say to them be "Smile". Not everyone who doesn't smile is sad. If you really want to know if they are unhappy strike up a conversation with them.

Some people prefer not to outwardly show thier emotions, and it can be quite irritating.
