YSK all those “old fashioned” tip about interviewing still matter.

content:
I’ve interviewed hundreds of people and the old fashioned tips still matter. Be a little early. Be prepared. Know about the job and company. Have good questions. These always matter. 

Make good eye contact. Smile a lot. Don’t bullshit - say you don’t know or didn’t understand - it’s better than a really shitty answer. If you have a disaster just fess up. No babysitter so the kid is in the waiting room? Pursuit of Happyness movie (yes it’s spelled that way) got paint on you? These are better as it says you will still take care of business. If I hear your phone you’ll get frowned upon unless you immediately apologize. If you look at your phone you’ll never get the job.  Write a follow up thank you. 

Above all else be real. If you bullshit and get the job then we find out what you’re really like or your real skills aren’t as good as you portrayed we will get rid of you. It wastes all our time.

Edit - I’m not a boomer. If common courtesy and politeness makes me old fashioned then I will take it. In many stiff shirt professional companies this is how it is. That’s just the simple truth. 

A lot of people are going up on this thank you thing. This is for professional positions   You do it for a few reasons: 1 when (not if) you realize you blew an answer or totally forgot something important you say it now. 2 unless a shitload of people are fighting over you, thank the people that took time to interview you and may offer you a lot of their hard earned money. Especially if interviewing isn’t their usual job. 3 it’s simply nice and takes all of 15 seconds. 4 until no one else is ever doing it you will be the one that didn’t and it looks bad on you. Or. no one else does and you do it looks good on you. FFS just do it .You will never be frowned upon for doing it. There is a huge chance you will be frowned upon for not.
