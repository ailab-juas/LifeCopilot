LPT: If you hate doing a task, time it next time you do it. Quite often, you'll realize that it takes less time than it feels and you'll be less likely to keep postponing it.

Edit: If it takes longer than expected, well now you know and you can work on a solution to do it quicker (keeping it safe) or, as suggested below and when possible, get rid of / automate the task!

Edit 2: Yes, this tip won't work for everyone as we're all different and react to different sources of motivation, but I'm glad it seemed helpful to some of you!

Oh and thanks for the awards :)
