title:
LPT: If you're eating ice cream directly out of a pint-sized container, you can stick the container in an oven mitt and hold the oven mitt. That way, your fingers don't freeze and your body heat doesn't melt the ice cream faster.

Edited to add: This does not imply that one is eating or should eat the entire pint in one sitting.

Replies to other common comments: 
1) I prefer not to use disposables if I can avoid it, that's why I don't use paper towels.
2) I don't put it in a bowl because then I don't have to wash a bowl. (I do put it in a bowl if I have bigger sized ice cream cartons, though.)
3) I find the oven mitt stays in place better than a dish towel.
4) I don't put the mitt on my hand because the thickness of the mitt, the width of the mitt's thumb, and the closeness of that thumb to the rest of the hand make me feel it is difficult to hold the container comfortably with the mitt on my hand.
5) I like using an oven mitt rather than a dedicated cozy because that's one fewer product to buy. I also like it better than a beanie because it's in the kitchen (the same room as the ice cream!)
6) I don't worry about it looking stupid because I'm never doing this in front of a group of people... you'd presumably be alone or with family if you did this. Also, I just tend not to worry about looking stupid. Beat of my own drummer and all that.
7) To the people who like it melty: well, some of us are one way, and some of us are another way... :)
8) If you don't like a tip, folks... if you find it unnecessary and stupid... you can just scroll on by...
