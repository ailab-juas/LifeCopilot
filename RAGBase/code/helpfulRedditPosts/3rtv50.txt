YSK about Cubital Tunnel Syndrome, how to prevent it, and how to treat it, especially if you sit at a desk all day

content:
**Cubital Tunnel Syndrome** is a condition that involves pressure or stretching of the [ulnar nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve) (also known as the “funny bone” nerve), which can cause numbness or tingling in the ring and small fingers, pain in the forearm, and/or weakness in the hand.  The ulnar nerve runs in a groove on the inner side of the elbow. [ASSH](http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-conditions/cubital-tunnel)

If you sleep with your arm under your pillow, repeatedly lean on your forearm/elbow (work an office job), bend your elbow for sustained periods (using your cell phone), holding a tool (mouse) in a constant position performing a task, and/or are obese, you are at an increased risk.

**Symptoms**

- Pain and numbness in the elbow, hand, little/ring finger.
- Weakness affecting the ring and little fingers.
- Decreased ability to pinch the thumb and index finger.
- Decreased overall hand grip.
- Muscle wasting in the hand.
- Claw-like deformity of the hand.

**Prevention**

Minimize the amount of time you lean on your elbows or keep them bent. If you like to sleep with your arm under your pillow, correct your sleep posture. Make sure your work environment is ergonomically correct. Get a pistol grip/vertical mouse and ergonomic keyboard, and make sure your desk is not too tall for you. Make sure to take frequent breaks from sitting at a desk.
 
**Treatment**

- Aside from simply avoiding activities that cause CTS, performing [Ulnar Nerve glides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJYubK6ZOxw) to stretch out the nerve may relieve pain.

- Ibuprofen can also alleviate the pain or numbness. 

- Surgery should be used as a last resort, but is a simple procedure that has a high success rate.
