LPT: The vast majority of people cannot keep secrets. Think long and hard before revealing true secrets to others.

content:
The best kept secret is one you never tell. To anyone. Ever. That you even feel the need to tell someone is this LPT’s Exhibit A - even you, the one with the true secret. The damning, fuck your life over secret…even you need to reveal that something to that someone. Before you do, give good thought to the person you’re going to tell. Are you TRULY close? Have they told you things others told them in confidence? If so…1) they value you more than that person or 2) they suck at keeping secrets. Think double hard if they are a drinker, unstable (in any way), or if your relationship is anything other than rock fucking solid. The end result of the analysis is usually: tell no one.
