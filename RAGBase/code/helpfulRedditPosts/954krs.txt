LPT: when cleaning out your closet, think “if I saw this at the store right now, would I buy this again?” If the answer is no, it might be time to get rid of that item.

content:
I use this when cleaning out my closet/room of old clothes/items. If I look at a top I usually think to myself, if I saw this for the first time would I buy this in the same size and color? If yes, then I keep it, if not, I donate it.

Edit: Not suggesting you should/would buy the same thing twice. It’s meant to be a reflective question of whether or not you still like it enough to keep, so if you had never gotten it and saw it for the first time at a store, would you still like it enough to spend money (in theory) on it today.
