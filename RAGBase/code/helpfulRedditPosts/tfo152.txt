LPT: Do not buy into the myth that your 20s and 30s are made to work hard. Burnout in your early career will resonate throughout your entire life.

content:
I often hear or read from people who suggest that you should work your ass off in your 20s and early 30s in order to make as much money as possible and secure a career. While well-intentioned, it's necessary to keep in mind that this will inevitably lead to burnout, and that is extremely damaging.

It is very difficult to recover from burnout. It will follow you for years. It's mentally damaging. For blue collar occupations, the same mindset can also lead to physical accidents which will have consequences for the rest of your life. That back or knee injury you seemingly quickly recovered from in your mid-20s will suddenly be an issue again as you get older.
