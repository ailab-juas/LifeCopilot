YSK that bread can transform hard brown sugar into soft brown sugar.

content:
I had a block of rock-hard brown sugar, stale from too many months or years on the shelf.  I heard a tip to put it with a piece of bread, so I moved it into a closed plastic bag with two pieces of whatever bread I had on hand. 

Now, one week later, my brown sugar is soft and packable as it once was.  A few pieces of bread transformed my hard sugar block into soft and malleable sugar.
