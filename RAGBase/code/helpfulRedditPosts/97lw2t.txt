LPT: When you're settling a debt with a friend, don't do it by buying them a gift or treating them to dinner. Square the debt with cash. They may actually need the money. Gifts or dinner should be a way to say thank you.

Edit: This is from the perspective of the debtor, not the lender. And, it's not necessarily about money borrowed so much as any kind of monetary debt you feel the need to repay: gas for car, Uber fees, consuming friends chips and beer (yeah, that's you Jonathan).
