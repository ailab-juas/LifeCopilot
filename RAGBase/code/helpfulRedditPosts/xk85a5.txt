LPT: Pay close attention to annoying things your family does. You might do them too.

content:
The word “family” here means whoever raised you. That might be parents, foster parents, older siblings, aunts/uncles, etc.

Both by nature and nurture, you pick up a lot of habits.

You probably know the big habits.

You might not have noticed the “little” habits, like walking loudly, random unhygienic habits, etc. Watch out for these things, because there’s a good chance you picked up at least some of them too. That way, you can be careful to break these habits.
