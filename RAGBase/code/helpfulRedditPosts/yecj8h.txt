YSK: A quick search of your state's unclaimed property office might be worth your time!

content:
Why YSK: Every US state has an unclaimed property division or office that holds on to property when they can't find its legal owner. Google *&lt;&lt;your state&gt;&gt; unclaimed propert*y to find the web site and enter your info. I just spent 5 minutes searching several states that I've lived in and found a few hundred dollars that I had no idea about.
