LPT: Cleaners are not that expensive and the service is well worth it if you have problems keeping your house clean

content:
I am a workaholic with mental health issues that reduce my ability to keep my environment clean.

After growing up poor, at 29 I recently got a good job that pays well but means less energy to tackle these things, but my house was so unclean that it was starting to weigh heavily on me mentally and socially. So I got a cleaner. Best money I ever spent - 120 euros so $116 for 6 hours of work and the place was infinitely more livable.

I was just thinking - since so many couples experience difficulties over division of work in the house (especially if you have kids or something), then the money spent on a cleaner is pocket change compared to the damage it can have on your relationship and the benefit of the additional time to relax and enjoy yourself outside of work. I know that's a lot of money for some people, I have absolutely been there, but if you can do it then do it.
