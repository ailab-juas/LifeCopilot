YSK: Women can have different kinds of orgasms based on stimuli (so can men).

content:
Women can have orgasms through clitoral, G-spot, and anal stimuli, all of which feel different. For men, yes, they do have a G-spot in their prostate, as well as penis related nerves that can cause orgasms. 

Why YSK: Being aware of this can definitely help improve your sexual relationship with your partner. By knowing where to stimulate you can get creative (with consent, obviously) with foreplay/sex.


Edit: I kept this simple to open a discussion, and keep it as simple as I could while being factual. Sex is still a sensitive subject to some people, so I was hoping by being concise those people would be more comfortable reading/exploring.   Yes, I know the G-spot is linked to the clitoris, I was going to keep personals out of it but they do feel different to me personally. And to the person who told me to do research through porn, I'm sorry you have a very unhealthy view of sex.


Edit: I realize now this was a.. rougher.. subject than I realized, and I should've provided these diagrams, I hope you all realize EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT, this is very important to know when talking about sex/pleasure. Porn is also NOT a good source of education on pleasure, for the most part it's about cinematics more than the actual act of sex. Masturbation videos can be helpful when trying to discover things about "where" things are on the outside, but the stimulation itself varies per person.

Nipples are also a good form of stimuli for some, as are other sensitive parts of the body based on the person themselves. I kept this more in the lower regions for a broader coverage. If anyone wants a diagram of the clitoral/penile nerves            - please read what the site says before judging the source, I found this picture on a university page that has been taken down, and the diagram was saved here for further educational purposes.

I have one of the male prostate too

***Despite this being a NSFW I would appreciate any DM conversations to be kept as educational. I do have a partner and wish to respect that.
