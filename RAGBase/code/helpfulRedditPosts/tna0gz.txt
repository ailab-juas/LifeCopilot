YSK it's better not to make your bed when you leave the hotel/motel room you stayed at

content:
Why YSK: basically it makes the housekeepers job easier and it makes your job easier too. When people make their beds when they leave, we have to strip them anyways and its easier when the linen is just in a pile rather than on the bed. It also makes it so we don't have to deal with as much uncertainty when pulling back the covers
