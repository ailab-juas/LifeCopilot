LPT: If your employer puts you on a pip (personal improvement plan). Start applying for a new job right away.

content:
In my experience employees Ive seen put on them rarely keep their jobs after the improvement period deadline is up even if they put in the effort to meet the goals. Its more or less a gentle way of fireing someone. 

Put in the work and try your hardest. But expect they will let you go when its up.
