LPT: If a close friend/coworker/roommate consistently insists on you not getting them a holiday gift, assume that it might be because they can’t afford to give you one back.

Some people were hit especially hard during COVID and are stretching every penny. While you may have great intentions, others may not have the means to return the favor and are embarrassed to not give you anything, meaning they have to choose between a necessity and getting you a gift.

Edit: I didn’t think this would blow up as much as it did. Thank you for all of the awards!
