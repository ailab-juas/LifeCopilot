YSK that children should NEVER be forced to give hugs, kisses, or any other affection to anyone - including family members

content:
Teaching kids about bodily autonomy from an early age is crucial, and giving them the tools to politely (but firmly) say "No" when they feel uncomfortable  performing affectionate acts is a great first step. 

Critically, this must include parents and other family members,  even if those people get their feelings hurt. The child's bodily autonomy and setting them up for their future as adults is more important than Great-Aunt Gertrude getting a halfhearted hug.


THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TICKLING. If a kid breathlessly asks you to stop tickling them, *even if they appear to be enjoying themselves and laughing*, it's important that you stop for them to catch their breath and do a quick check-in to see of they want to continue. 

 Almost every time I've done this with my own son, he will ask for more tickles after catching his breath.

 It's about letting them know that their body belongs to THEM. 

**WHY YSK:**

Because everyone has the right to decide whether they want to be touched,  and that includes children,  from as early as possible. 

There are countless examples of all the dark things that kids suffer through every day which I don't need to get into, we all know what they are. 

To be clear, it is NEVER the child's fault if they are  victimized,  nor is this advice meant to be some kind of protection against evil. 

I'm a mother to a toddler, and my husband and I are in full agreement on this, practicing what we preach.  If kiddo doesn't want to get all cuddled up on, he knows he can always refuse and we will listen.
