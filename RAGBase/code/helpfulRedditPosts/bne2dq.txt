YSK that there is a far better version of Stonehenge. When people think about Britain, they often think of Big Ben, Redbuses and Stonehenge. But just 25 miles from Stonehenge there's this place called Avebury...

I've heard the price for parking fluctuates throughout the year, but I think it's between £4-£8 to park all day, which is pretty reasonable as it's a national trust car park so the money goes back into preservation. It does have public transport link (bus) but it's in the middle of nowhere.
