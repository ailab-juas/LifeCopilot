LPT: If you are thinking about leaning in for the kiss, but you aren't quite sure if you'll be turned down, try touching or running your fingers through their hair; if they recoil at all, leaning in is no-go, if they seem unphased or especially if they smile, you have the green light.

***Disclaimer: This is applicable to most scenarios. If you try it on your friend's mom, you're getting slapped.

EDIT: As someone pointed out, there are many acceptable gestures that *should* accomplish the same goal. You are breaking the "touch barrier" and reading his/her reaction.

EDIT: Keep in mind, context is key and can be the deciding factor as to whether or not this works.

EDIT: This has blown up way more than I expected! Thanks for the support and I'll answer questions if I can get to them.

EDIT: Thanks for my *first* gold there, stranger!
