LPT: Add -pinterest.* to your search query to remove ALL results from Pinterest. The asterisk serves as a boolean wildcard and is more effective than just -pinterest.com.

Edit: I incorrectly referred to this as a boolean operator, which it is not. Boolean values must be either TRUE or FALSE and, in search terms, uses the values AND, OR, or NOT. See [MIT's LibGuide](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175963&amp;p=1158594) or [Open Semantic Search](https://www.opensemanticsearch.org/doc/search/operators) for more information and helpful search terms!
