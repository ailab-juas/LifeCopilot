YSK: You don’t need use an app to track your period

content:
Why YSK: The general lack of privacy and ownership of your personal, sensitive data with your phone apps. Your period tracking app is really just an excel sheet with visually pleasing UI.  
  

Because of that, you can create your own within excel or sheets and you then own your own data. 
  

[Aliza Aufrichtig](https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com) is an editor at the NYTimes. Highly encourage you to read her but I digress. 
  
She took the time on a how-to create your own period tracking app, WITH calendar integrations.

Excel is actually pretty tame and this won’t be a difficult project to take on!
