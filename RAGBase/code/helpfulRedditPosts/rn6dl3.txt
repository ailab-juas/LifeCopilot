YSK: The Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning

content:
Why YSK: Recognizing the symptoms could save lives and mitigate/prevent other serious permanent consequences such as brain damage.  You or someone you love could be suffering from CO poisoning right now and not even know it.

My sister and her husband could've died.

I overheard my sister telling our mom that she is still losing hair and can't figure out why - this is red flag #1, but it didn't click in my brain at that point.

Several hours later, my sister was having a discussion with our dad.  For the sake of brevity, here are the important parts:

Dad (joking): "It sounds like your house is haunted!"

Sister: "It literally is haunted.  I see ghosts all the time."

*click*

Me: "Do you have a CO detector in your house?"

Sister: "No.  Why?"

Long story short, her house did indeed have a CO leak.

Other symptoms her and her husband were experiencing:

 - Dull headache
 - Weakness
 - Dizziness
 - Nausea

These symptoms had gone on for so long that they just accepted them as a normal part of life.

Additional symptoms can be found [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642) and [here](https://whippleplumbing.com/low-exposure-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/)

If you or someone you know are inexplicably experiencing any of these symptoms: get the hell out of the house IMMEDIATELY and pick up a CO detector, then call a plumber/Fire Department/utility company/HVAC professional if it goes off.  You could potentially save lives.

Edit:  Forgot to mention - Symptoms go away after leaving the house for a while, such as visiting family.  My sister and her husband said they feel great when they aren't in the house.  This is another significant indicator of CO poisoning.

If I hadn't stumbled across your comment so many years ago, I never would've been properly equipped to recognize the symptoms.
