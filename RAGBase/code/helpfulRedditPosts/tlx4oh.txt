LPT: buy a perfume on vacation

content:
Buy a perfume early on a trip and wear it every day you’re there. Then put it away for a while. When you use it again you’ll immediately be transported back to the trip. Feelings, images, memories, all come right back.

For extra shushz, buy a fragrance that is made in the area you’re visiting. My favorite so far is my London fragrance,  which is Ted Baker Polly.

EDIT: I meant “zhuzh” but took a wild (incorrect) guess on how to spell it!
