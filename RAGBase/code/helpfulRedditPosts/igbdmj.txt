YSK that until November 2000, military dogs were euthanized or abandoned after retirement, however, you can now adopt one as a member of your family

Before this time service dogs were considered “military surplus equipment” and deemed unfit to adjust to civilian life. These heroes were thrown away or put down instead of honored. President Clinton passed “Robby’s Law” in 2000 which allows handlers and their families first dibs at adopting military animals at the end of their useful service. The dogs are next offered to law enforcement, then adoptive families. Organizations like Saveavet.org place these retired heroes with suitable families and ensure they are given the honorable discharge they deserve. There is currently a waiting lists of civilians who want to give these veterans a loving home in which to retire. The wait is up to 12-18 months as of this post.

Military working dogs usually hold a higher rank than their handler. This is to prevent the handler from mistreating their dog and is usually a sign of respect. Most Military working dogs hold the rank of an Non-Commissioned officer. After their service every measure is taken to ensure that they are trained to get acclimated to civilian life. MWD's are usually German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois and Labrador's to name a few.

There are about 2500 dogs in active service today and about 700 deployed overseas.
