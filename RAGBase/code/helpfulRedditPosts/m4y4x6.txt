YSK: Our brain is also made to forget, and memories are not reliable. Don't take decisions, and don't beat yourself, based on your memories. It's ok to forget and forgive

content:
Why YSK:  Many people fuck it up because of this. They miss chances, they miss experiences, and they miss on discovering themselves or the world. 

It will be hard to deal with this, I know, but there is beauty to it.

 And I know it's not easy, but you have to be aware of it. 

* When you don't want to try that food, because you remember you tried it and you didn't like it, unless you are allergic, give it a try. 
* When you think you don't like a certain sport, genre of music or film, or anything really, but you cannot explain it, try it anyway. It might be that you've had a bad experience earlier in life, but if you don't know for sure what it was, try it again. 

* Unless you remember immediate danger out of the previous experience with a certain thing, try it again, despite what you think you remember.
* Don't judge people based on how you remember them. They change, and so are you. 
* Apply all this to yourself. Don't beat yourself on who you were. If you failed once, it doesn't mean you'll do it again.

EDIT: There are concerns about this not being scientifically researched. 
Here are a few articles mentioning the research done into the forgetting capacity of the brain:
