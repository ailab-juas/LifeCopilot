YSK: if you have an exceptional dog that is well behaved and smart, get a puppy before your dog gets too old to get around. The adult dog will teach the new puppy how he should act in your home.

This was the best advice our vet gave us. We've done this 4 times. A couple pups still needed a bit of training but not nearly as much as our first dog.

Edit: an example is when we brought home a new puppy and we were training him to do stuff, sit, stay, etc. When we got to roll over the pup just didn't get what he was supposed to do. After about 5-10 minutes the older dog sighed, nudged the pup so he would look at him and then did the trick. He did the trick a few times and the puppy finally caught on.

Edit 2: please note This isn't for every dog. The dog has to be well TRAINED first. YOU have to be able to control your dog via training. 

Edit 3: thank you for the silver!

Edit 4: let me stress that just being a good boy isn't what I mean when I say well behaved. The dog has to be trained properly first. He has to know what behavior is expected of him. Then when you get the new dog he can help teach the dog how he is expected to behave. Basic training should still be part of the new dog's life.
