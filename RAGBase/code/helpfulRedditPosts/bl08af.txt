title:
YSK that Cinco de Mayo isn't Mexico's Independence Day, but a commemoration of Mexico's victory of France at the battle of Puebla in 1862.

content:
Outside of Puebla itself, Cinco de Mayo is really not that much of a big deal. September 16th is Mexico's Independence day and mark the day "El Grito de Dolores" started their Independence war - that day, much like July 4th, is a big deal.

EDIT: In the title I meant "victory *over* France"
