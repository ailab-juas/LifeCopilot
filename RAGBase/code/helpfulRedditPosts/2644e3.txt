From http://www.blogyoutrust.com/if-ever-you-see-your-cat-or-dog-do-this-please-take-them-to-the-vet: "Head pressing is characterized by the compulsive act of pressing the head against a wall or other object for no apparent reason. This generally indicates damage to the nervous system, which may result from a number of varying causes, including prosencephalon disease (in which the forebrain and thalamusparts of the brain are damaged) or toxic poisoning."
