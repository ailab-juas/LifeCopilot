LPT: Give compliments without putting yourself down. It'll make the compliment more sincere.

content:
Instead of saying, "Wow you're a great artist, I can hardly draw stick figures!" Say, "Wow you're a great artist!" Those kinds of compliments are awkward for the recipient to navigate.

It has the added benefit of practicing not comparing yourself to other people. You don't have to beat yourself down to build others up. It also is practice in not making someone else's accomplishment/talents etc about yourself. 

Give your compliment, and stop. Voila! Sincerity.
