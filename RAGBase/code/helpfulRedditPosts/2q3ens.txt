LPT: how to shake the parmesan cheese shaker correctly (i was doing it wrong my entire life)!

content:
Take the parmesan shaker, keep it parallel to the ground, and shake like [this](http://imgur.com/3H4C3L4).  I used to always turn it fully upside down and try to hammer away the cheese to my pizza without success, because it clumps the cheese rather than the grate acting almost like a slicer. I've been doing this wrong my entire life!
