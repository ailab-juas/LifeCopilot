LPT: Think very carefully before establishing business or personal relationship with someone who never admits his/her mistakes.

content:
You can interpret however you want it, but this has become a red flag for me when I meet new colleagues and friends.  Here are some other traits I've discovered that have been consistent with this characteristic:  
Always accuses others for his/her mistakes.
Always take credit for everything and announces it to the world.
Always agree with you but turn around and tell your boss or other colleagues, friends, etc.. She/he disagrees with you.
Always criticize others and especially you in a passive agressive way, but when you criticize the person, he/she is defensive and acts like a victim.
Never really listens to you and interrupts you.  
Always about me, I, or my, but never about us, we, or our.
Talk the talk, but never walk the walk. Seriously sorry!
