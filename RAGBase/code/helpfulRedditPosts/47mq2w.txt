LPT: when leaving a job or even getting fired, do it as gracefully as possible.

This may be obvious to many, but I think it's very common (especially for younger, less experienced people) to exit a job and want to stir things up dramatically, perhaps out of bitterness or wanting petty revenge on whoever wronged you.

Revenge is cheap and worth perhaps a little vindictive pleasure but ultimately it is likely to hurt you in the long run. People talk, your superiors are better connected than you are and word gets around fast. Don't burn bridges unless you absolutely have to. 

**Real life example:** Last year I was fired from my job for the worst reason - underperformance. I sat down in front of both Directors and had them tell me in no uncertain terms this was an incontrovertible decision. I was angry. I felt wronged, my situation was complicated and they weren't hearing my side. However, I listened to what they said, discussed a few points and at the end of the meeting thanked them for the opportunity, shook hands and calmly explained to them everything they'd need to do to hand over my accounts/passwords etc.

Doing this ended up with being able to put one of those Directors down as a reference, which in turn has helped secure a new position for a great company. I've heard that he was especially complimentary towards me.

**TL;DR:** when leaving any workplace think firstly about how you want your own reputation to stand rather than how you want to pull down anyone else.
