YSK: If you meet a woman online and shortly after meeting, she wants you to send her nudes, it is almost definitely a scam

content:
Why YSK: All the time over on r/scams we see boys/men posting saying that they sent nudes to a "girl" online and now they're being extorted for money. It is an extremely common scam and people fall for it every day. Just don't send nudes to people you dont actually know in real life (better yet dont send nudes at all).

If you have sent nudes and are being extorted (often this comes in the form of the fake girl's "dad" saying she's underage and threatening you), just block and delete them, dont send any money. They won't actually do anything because all they want is money; they'll just move on to their next mark.
