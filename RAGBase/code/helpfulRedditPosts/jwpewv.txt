LPT: If you plan on ordering food, try calling the restaurant directly vs. using a delivery app. You can save on fees and the restaurant will earn all the proceeds

I recently tried ordering food from Door Dash and realized they were charging around $8 for fees. 

I called the restaurant and they said I could order directly through them, saving me almost $15 in the process (they also didnâ€™t charge delivery). 

Door Dash takes an average of 20% from the restaurant. Ordering directly gives all the money to them
