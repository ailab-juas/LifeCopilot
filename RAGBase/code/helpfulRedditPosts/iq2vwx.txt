YSK: How to properly administer an Epipen

content:
Why YSK: It can save someones life and it’s a good health skill to have that will come in handy for someone else. I read in a post today about teachers who will not attempt to learn [how to do it](https://youtu.be/EN83hen4D-Y) correctly for fear of being sued and they would rather let the kids asphyxiate. So if you have kids or can influence small children, don’t be afraid to spread good information along!
