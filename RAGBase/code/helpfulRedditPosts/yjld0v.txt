LPT: If TikTok continues to put someone or something that you don’t like on your feed just close out of the app. That’s the worst response possible for the algorithm.

I heard about this and implemented it about 2 weeks ago in response to all the Andrew Tate videos I was getting. Just noticed I haven’t seen him at all now and feel this tip really worked.

Edit: This post is directed towards those who use TikTok. If you plan on saying “delete TikTok” just scroll down and upvote the 100 comments that already said it. People are on TikTok, people know China controls it, I’ll just enjoy it until the US bans it or a new non Chinese version comes out. I highly doubt your under 5 word post is what convinces someone to actually delete it.
