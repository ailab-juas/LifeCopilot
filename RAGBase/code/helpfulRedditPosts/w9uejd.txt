LPT: When flying, put a Tile or other Bluetooth tracker in your bags. You’ll always know where they are.

Just flew from Asia to the US and was able to see where my bags were at all times. I could even tell when they were on the plane, since my phone could connect to them (obviously depends on the plane).

This trick really shines when you’re trying to find your bag in a sea of luggage on the floor.
