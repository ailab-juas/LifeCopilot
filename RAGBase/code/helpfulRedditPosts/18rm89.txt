LPT: Bring a piece of cardboard to put under your feet at outdoor stadiums in the winter. 

content:
This one comes from watching Bears games at Soldier Field in December, when it's so cold that your beer starts to freeze before you finish drinking it (the adult IRL equivalent of tauntauns at the first marker). Odds are you have bundled up as much as you can and you might even have two pairs of socks under your boots, but the cold concrete WILL numb your toes after a while. Bring a piece of cardboard to put under your shoes will go a long way in keeping your toes warm. Homeless people sleep on boxes for a reason. 

tl;dr: cardboard is an insulator; you can learn stuff from homeless people.
