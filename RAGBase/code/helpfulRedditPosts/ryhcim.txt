LPT : If you already know you are going to watch a movie, skip the trailer. You don't need to convince yourself you need to watch it and the spoilers aren't worth it

I find this especially true with marvel movies, I am a big fan and I know I will go watch them regardless. Avoiding the trailer will save you from many spoilers and make the overall experience a heck of a lot better
