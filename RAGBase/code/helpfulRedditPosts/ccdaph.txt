title:
LPT: if you’re cooking something and have already added enough salt but it’s still “missing something,” add some lemon/lime juice or a splash of vinegar.

content:
Often times the “thing” that the dish is missing is acidity and a small splash of something acidic can really add a lot of depth to a dish.

Edit: people keep saying “or just add this.” What I mean is that if you have already added all additional spices/flavor/fat to the dish, and it still feels like it’s missing something, then look to add something acidic. Not just salt and vinegar lol.
