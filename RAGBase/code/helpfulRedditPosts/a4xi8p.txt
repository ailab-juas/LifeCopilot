LPT: Have multiple, well-formatted resumes geared towards specific skill-sets instead of one gigantic resume detailing every single thing you've ever done.

I've been doing a lot of hiring/interviews for my company lately so I'd like to share some resume/job application tips for those who need it/would like it:

1. **FORMAT YOUR FUCKING RESUME.** Seriously, I CANNOT stress this enough. If you're not using a resume building tool (like on Indeed) or are submitting a hard copy, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD don't walk in with some half-assed text wall and expect someone to decipher the information they need. Microsoft Word and most other word processors have templates available for this exact thing. USE THEM. Also, stay away from lots of colors. We don't care how pretty it looks, and it's distracting. Also, unformatted resumes make you look lazy, like you won't even put in the effort to make a good first impression. No bueno. 
2. **ORGANIZE** the information you provide on your resume, and make sure it's easy to read. When hiring, managers usually have to read dozens of resumes, and if you've got too much going on they'll just skim over it and move on. DO NOT OVERSHARE. If you have more than 4 jobs under your belt, try to limit the ones you list to those that are applicable to the field or position you're applying to.
3. **HAVE MULTIPLE RESUMES.** This goes back to the previous point (and title) - if you've got a lot of experience in a bunch of different fields, it makes more sense to have two or three resumes geared towards specific skill sets than to have one gigantic resume listing everything you've ever done. It's harder for a hiring manager to hone in on what they're looking for if they've got your whole life story to sort through.
4. **PAY SOMEONE IF YOU HAVE TO.** If you can afford it, pay someone to write up and format your resume(s). It's a good investment, and once you've got the template it's easy to edit your information as needed. It seems like a no-brainer, but surprisingly few people think about this.
