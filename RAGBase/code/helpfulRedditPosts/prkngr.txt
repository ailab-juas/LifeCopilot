LPT there’s a google map feature that prevents you from ever being late

content:
I wish I knew this feature existed 5 years ago

Ok so if put in your desired location into Google maps and press directions (don’t press start yet), scroll to the bottom of the screen and there’s an option to set an alarm to tell you what time to leave based on what time you want to arrive

Idk if everyone knew this already but for me it’s game changing to not have to check the app constantly to see if changes in traffic are going to make me late for something

Already posted this on r/ADHD to help the homies out
