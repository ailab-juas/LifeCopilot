LPT: you may not have "poor social skills" sometimes you're just not with your kind of people

content:
If you don't feel comfortable with your friends and frequently feel like they're in another vibe and have other sense of humour you need to find people who have similar hobbies and personalities.

That sounds extremely obvious, but because you're in your comfort zone you just never feel the need to hang out with other people.

Speaking from experience!
