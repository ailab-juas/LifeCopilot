YSK Orange juice "not from concentrate" aka may be a year old and refreshed with flavour packs

content:
**edit:** That was going to be **...versus pure aka Premium...**

**edit:** messed up the edit too

 This is from a Canadian investigative consumer watchdog TV show on CBC TV in Canada.

* Premium orange juice compared to frozen concentrate doesn't mean it's pure

* Even "100% pure" on the label is not true (at least in Canada follow our consumer labeling laws)

* "Nothing added" on the label i.e. sugar or whatever is not true

* During processing the orange juice is pasteurized, de-oxygenated and stored in large vats for months, the orange flavour is lost

* Each orange juice company uses what is called flavour packs a secret formula they add to their orange juice

* The flavour packs are manufactured by a company that makes perfumes (yes the kind of perfume you wear) orange essence and oils

* Ethyl butyrate a natural occurring compound is added since it has that fresh OJ smell we've been trained to think as orange juice. So-called premium orange juice has large amounts of ethyl butyrate added compared to non-premium
