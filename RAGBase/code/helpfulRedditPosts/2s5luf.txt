LPT: Use one big trashbag for non-food non-smelly trash, and a small one for the smelly to throw out frequently

content:
I guess a family can fill a big bag quickly, but as a lone student I find this system better, to limit both smell (the food is thrown out fast) and waste (I don't have to throw out a bag before it's full). Also I like I don't have to tie and carry a big bag, it's very light and easy to dispose of.
