LPT: Ever get corrected on calling someone by the wrong name? Respond with, "What did I say?" It implies that you truly knew the person's name but your mouth said something different, which can help you feel less embarrassed.

Also useful for times when you use words incorrectly. Just a mannerism that I thought I should adopt.
