LPT: Motivation is fleeting. Discipline will get the job done.

content:
If you depend on motivation for things like going to the gym to get that summer bod, or starting your side hustle, you wont put in the work on the days you dont feel like it.

Discipline will make you push through the days even when you arent in the mood. Those are the most important days. Its what seperates a success from a failure.

Edit: If you'd like to learn how to be disciplined, have the following mentality - Whenever you see something small in your life that will bring you pain today but pleasure in the future, do it. It could be as small as walking up the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Not eating a midnight snack etc... The trick is to start small, work your way up. Someone in this thread said it best, its like a muscle

Edit 2: Ok wow, RIP inbox. Glad you guys found this helpful. Its basically my motto, and gets me through the various shitty points of my days on the path to my goals.
