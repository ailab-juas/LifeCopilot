YSK: Laundry Softener Builds Up Gunk in Your Washing Machine

content:
Why YSK: It can ruin your washing machine over time and cause build up which can cause your clothes to not be so clean. It also has a chemical known to cause irritation and asthma flare ups, not to mention its horrible for marine life. 

Instead, use a little bit of white vinegar. Softens clothes just as well, and takes away mildew smell.
