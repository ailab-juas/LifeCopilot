LPT: make your home security cameras obvious.

content:
It's cheaper to deter a crime than to report one. If people think they are on camera they are much less likely to commit a crime. Even an obvious fake camera can be very effective. Get one with the darkened dome so it's hard to see where it's pointing. 

This is the same reason shopping centres have those dark dome cameras. People knowing they are on camera is a much bigger deterrent than invisible cameras.
