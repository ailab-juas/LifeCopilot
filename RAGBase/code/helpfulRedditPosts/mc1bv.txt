LPT needs to refocus on actual pro tips, not reminders to practice common sense or common courtesy.

content:
  I have seen many "protips" about how to either have common courtesy or common sense.   Some examples from the current front page:

* "Be nice to people who work around you",

*  "Do your homework"
* "Eating things in moderation is good"
* "Make sure put out plenty of whatever your guests need out before they come."
* "Don't be a giant mess when your landlord comes over".  

I know these things might be news to some people, but there is no way you could think they're "pro tip".  

To me, if you are a professional in a field and have a tip that people out of the field probably don't know, that's what i was looking for.  

Are you a mechanic? You might want to tell people about how easy it is to diagnose a check engine light for OBD-I vehicles.

Are you a movie theater employee? You might want to discuss the legitimate but little-known ways to get a discount on admission or which foods that the theaters don't mind you bringing in.  

I was going to post this as a reply to a particular post, but decided that a self-post would be a better route.
