LPT: if you come across an unexpected increase in money, don't go telling people about it.

content:
While it's tempting to be happy and outspoken about a stroke of good fortune - whether it's a lump sum payout, a tax break, a significant salary increase or a lottery ticket - it's in your best interest not to blow your horn about it.

Aside from potentially making your friends needlessly envious, people will start coming out of the woodwork for financial help. You'll be amazed and disappointed at how many people you suddenly owe favours to, how many just can't pay the rent, or are stuck in a bind, or expect you to shell out to because you're now "rich". This especially includes toxic family members.

Be generous if you feel like it but keep it close to your chest.
