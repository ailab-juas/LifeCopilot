LPT: There is absolutely no reason to not have a dashcam in your car.

content:
In a world plagued with bad drivers, distracted drivers, road ragers, insurance scammers, straight up liars, unethical insurance adjusters who wring every penny away from you... the odds are stacked against you.  Having constant surveillance is a powerful tool to prove your innocence. 

Dashcams are out of your way, fairly easy to set up and reliable. Timestamped footage will counter any false testimony and will prevent idiots from shirking responsibility.

A good dashcam will pay for itself many times over. I've won insurance settlements for seemingly bizarre accidents where it was difficult to prove the other person's fault all with a simple email with the video attached. 

Bonus: You get to capture beautiful vistas or scenic drives that spring up on long drives!
