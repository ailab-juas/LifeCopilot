LPT: Use a seam ripper to get the hair out of the brush roll part of your vacuum!

content:
As a lady with long hair, I constantly find my vacuum in need of de-hairing. I used to try and use scissors, then it occurred to me one day to try the seam ripper from my sewing kit. LIFE. CHANGER. Now instead of it taking 30 minutes to cut and pull the hair out, it takes me less than 5! Happier vacuum and happier me!
