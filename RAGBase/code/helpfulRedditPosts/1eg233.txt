title:
LPT for concert goers, from an audio engineer

content:
Don't try to get as close to the stage as possible for festivals or non reserved concerts. The best spots are near the audio engineers. Seeing as they EQ the concert to where they are going to be. Also, most of the times the audio engineer has to have a line of sight to the stage. This means there tends to be lots of room. Side note, don't wear ipod headphones. For $50 you can get a really good pair of headphones and save your ears.
