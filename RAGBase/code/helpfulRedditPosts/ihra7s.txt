LPT: If you smell a fish odor in an unusual place in your home, check your outlets or plugged-in electronics, it could be indicative of an overheating circuit.

content:
When a circuit overheats the plastics/chemicals in outlets and wire insulation can emit a fishy odor.  An overheated circuit or melted wire insulation can create an electrical fire. 

This knowledge just saved my apartment. My fiance complained of a bad smell in his office, we checked the trashcan, looked in the closet but we haven't made fish in weeks so we were confused. Then, I remembered what my Grandpa, a career electrician, used to tell me, strange fishy odor = potential electrical fire. So we unplugged everything in that room and the odor stopped. 

The electrician we hired found the issue in the outlet and saw two wires with melted insulation that were touching, basically fire kindling.
