YSK that at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, asphalt temps can be 140 degrees. Your dogs paw pads can become SEVERELY burned. If they are picking their feet up one at a time, it’s a good indicator they need to move to a grassy or shaded area

People bring their pets with them to 4th of July celebrations without realizing how hot the asphalt gets. I’m a vet tech and watching the dogs pick their feet up one at a time while standing on it because it’s hurting them makes my heart hurt. I keep meaning to post this around the 4th because people love their pets they just don’t know. 

Protective booties can be purchased and even if they hate them at first, you’re doing the right thing for them and they’ll adjust. Or just keep them on the grass! Have a great weekend everyone
