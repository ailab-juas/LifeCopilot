**Top image**: You can easily see where the blade will cut the paper

**Bottom image**: Much harder to see where the blade will cut. Not impossible, but harder.

Sorry about the picture quality. Had to dig out an old camera because my phone was in use!

To clarify: The phone is UNDER the paper. Make sure your guillotine (or paper cutter as it seems to be known in other parts of the world) isn't going to damage your phone beforehand.
