LPT: Mother's day and Father's day aren't always happy days for everyone. Reach out to friends and family members who may be having a tough time this father's day

content:
I myself get carried away in Hallmark holidays and forget that mother's day and Father's day isn't always a positive experience for people. 

Reachout to those who may not be celebrating due to their relationship with their parents/ loss of parents , as the day can be pretty lonely, even a small text goes a long way.
