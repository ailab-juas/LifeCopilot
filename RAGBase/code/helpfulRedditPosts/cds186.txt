LPT: Is someone you love having a baby soon? Most people will gift newborn size clothes for the baby shower, buy 6-12 month clothes for them instead, newborn size doesnt usually fit for long if at all, but getting that bigger size means it will fit at some point, it's also one less expense for them.

Edit: Thanks for the silver I'm glad someone enjoyed this tip enough to give it. Also as a lot of people are pointing out, make sure you take seasons into consideration, that swim suit is really cute but wont really be helpful in December. Good luck parents!
