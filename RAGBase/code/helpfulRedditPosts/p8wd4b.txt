LPT: when you see a rented truck, assume the driver is not accustomed to driving that type of vehicle and give them a little extra space and patience.

I’ve recently had to rent a large truck a few times and I noticed that people were particularly aggressive around me when I was driving it. I’m going slower than I would in my normal car, trying to be safe but definitely not very comfortable in the vehicle so it’s a little difficult. I think people don’t usually think about the fact that people driving a rental, especially when it’s a very large vehicle, aren’t pros at driving it. Driving a massive truck or van is nothing like driving a Honda Civic. Anyway, just try to be considerate and don’t assume the driver is just an idiot. They’re very likely driving something very unfamiliar and uncomfortable and could use a little understanding from fellow drivers.
