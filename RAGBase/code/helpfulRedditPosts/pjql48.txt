LPT: Even if you're not a hunter, wear blaze orange when you go out into the woods for hiking or camping so the hunters can see you!

content:
Hunting season is starting in many places and if a hunter sees a blaze orange (or pink) vest they will know it's not safe to take the shot. You can get these at any outdoor sporting goods store.

ETA: Thank you for the responses. Yes, a hunter is absolutely 100% responsible for making damn sure there is nothing behind their target. And they aren't allowed to shoot across roads or bodies of water. And they aren't allowed to hunt on private property without both the license from the state AND written permission from land owner. Hunting where there are a lot of people (like popular hiking trails) isn't a good idea since there will be too many people and many animals.

Edit 2: Cheese n sprinkles this blew up! This post wasn't put up to debate the ethics of hunting, the legality of using public lands, the funding sources for DFW, or other topics. Wearing blaze orange allows hunters to know without a doubt that the direction they are looking is not safe to shoot at by allowing you to stand out against the foliage. Hunters will not be on heavily used trails as there are no animals there. And hunters who are being dumb about how they are shooting shouldn't be out like that to begin with.
