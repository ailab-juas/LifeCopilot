YSK that in Australia, you can freecall 1800 022 222 anytime to speak to a registered nurse about your health concerns

My Canadian-ex was always calling some nurses-advice hotline when unsure whether to visit the local ER or the GP.  Today I found Australia's equivalent!

By freecalling 1800 022 222 (known as Healthdirect Australia) you can speak to a registered nurse at anytime about your health concerns.  Unsure whether or not you should seek medical help or wait it out? This hotline no doubt comes in useful for a variety of situations.

If Australia and Canada have this, I'm sure other countries have equivalent systems in place too!
