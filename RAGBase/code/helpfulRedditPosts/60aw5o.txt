LPT: If someone didn't hear you and asks you to repeat what you said, say the exact same words, don't rephrase.

content:
I'm about 80% deaf in my left ear and 40% in my right with persistent tinnitus. I often have to ask people to repeat what they said. If you repeat exactly what you said the first time, I can build a pattern of what was said which helps me understand for the future. If you completely change what you said the second time around, it's totally confusing as to what I heard the first time.
