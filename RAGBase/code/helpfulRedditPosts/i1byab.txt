YSK: If an employee is giving you a professional response with factual information then requesting the manager isn't going to change the fucking outcome.

content:
A good manager can properly train and develop his or her staff to professionally handle most situations to an extent. If they're being sincere and giving honest answers then why continue to get upset and request the manager? A good manager will kindly give you the same response. Giving the circumstances that apply to what I'm trying to say. Thank you all.

Edit: Guys and Gals I am a manager. The post is basically saying I'll most likely tell you what my staff told you cause I proper trained them on how to respond in certain situations
