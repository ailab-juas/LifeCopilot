LPT: If you are a student and are moving into a new leased house, take a picture of every wall, closet, cupboard and furniture.

content:
This way, if the house owner/landlord is trying to take your deposit or claiming damage at the end of your lease, you can show him the pictures. Take a picture, even of the **FLOOR**. Make sure the date and time are stamped on the pictures as well. This can be best done by emailing the videos/photos to yourself.

Edit : **This applies to ANYONE leasing/renting, not just students.**

A video walkthrough is also a good method.

I'll be adding tips from others in the comments as well.

Edit 2: Thank you kind redditors for the awards. I hope this tip saves you and other you know some money. :)
