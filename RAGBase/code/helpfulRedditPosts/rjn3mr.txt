LPT: "Assuming negative intent" is one of the quickest/easiest ways to sabotage your entire life.

content:
"Assuming negative intent" refers to a common psychological response that we as humans have to assume negative intentions in others.

Some real examples I've seen or experienced:

* Someone asking questions at work means they're criticizing you
* Having a bad date or interaction with a potential partner means you're unattractive/undesirable, or that said person is \[insert incel speech here\]
* Friends bail on some plans therefore they don't like you and/or are a bad friend

The inverse of these (assuming positive intent) would be:

* The person is asking questions simply because they want to understand something, or because you have knowledge on the subject
* The person has another reason for their response (you aren't compatible, they aren't looking for a relationship, they maybe aren't that into you but doesn't mean someone else won't be)
* Your friend(s) maybe just weren't feeling it and needed time to themselves, have other things they're dealing with, or like you as a friend but can't participate in everything all the time

Assuming negative intent is disastrous because it impacts every aspect of your life - it will sabotage your career, your relationships, your self-esteem, and more.

Training yourself to assume positive intent will make your life better across the board, even in the rare circumstances where there was actual negative intent (because you'll handle it better regardless).

**Edit #1** \-

Based on replies I want to point out an important thing about this method. It's not about being right or wrong. Positive assumptions can be wrong as well. *However*, you'll almost always respond better to a situation if you don't let negative assumptions turn you negative. The point is to always remind yourself that assumptions are just that - **assumptions.** To fixate on the "truth" (which of your assumptions is ultimately correct) is to miss the point of this advice.

**Edit #2** \-

There are some negative replies misinterpreting the point of this advice. It's always the same and the actual purpose of this tool is being missed:

*"This makes you \[gullible/weak/stupid/ripe for manipulation\]"* \- If you are using positive thinking as a method for blinding trusting people or "tricking yourself" into believing things you're doing it wrong. This is about maintaining control over your emotions and recognizing when you're about to sabotage **yourself** by reacting badly to situation due to an assumption you've made. If you are actually practicing this you should be **more** resistant to manipulation, not less.

*"Just wait until you meet \[toxic person\]. You'll change your tune then!"* \- No I won't. I've dealt with plenty of toxic people in my line of work and this method has made me much better at dealing with them. When someone is intentionally a jerk I don't lose my temper and do something foolish that will hurt my career, because I've practiced this method and have learned that even when someone has negative intentions the worst thing you can do is respond impulsively and out of emotion.

*"You're an idiot."* \- Congratulations! You're the person that would benefit most from this advice. A random person on the internet has gotten under your skin for nothing more than making a positive advice post. You might be hurting yourself in ways you don't realize and ironically are probably easy to manipulate, despite thinking you're smarter than everyone else.
