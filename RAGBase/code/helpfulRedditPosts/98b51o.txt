YSK: When searching discount codes on the web, use a different browser or private browsing. Discount codes websites force you to click on affiliate links before revealing the code, earning them a commission from your purchase whether the code was legit or not.

Using a different browser will isolate the affiliate tracking cookie on that browser. Private browsing does not save any tracking cookies so that works too.

If you're on Firefox then just use a different container tab from the one you plan on making your purchase on.
