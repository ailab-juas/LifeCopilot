LPT: Make peace with the fact that you have nothing to prove to anyone and you can walk away. It will change your perspective and ultimately save you time and emotional energy.

content:
Some people just want to see the world and everything in it burn. You try to tell them, and educate them, but nothing you say will get through to this person. 

It’s okay to have pride. It’s okay to be upset. But recognize that you have absolutely nothing to prove to anyone. You’re great, you’re doing your thing, and you got this. 

It’s okay to walk away, it doesn’t make you seem like a lesser person. You haven’t failed anything. That’s just a mental “what if” that the person is using to control you. 

Disclaimer: Applies to social situations that are emotionally fueled and will ultimately bring more harm to you than good. A little common, but worthy of a reminder nonetheless. 

Stay safe and happy out there, you got this.
