LPT: Put a piece of clear packing tape over the speaker on toys that are loud and obnoxious. It will significantly reduce the volume.

I learned this when I nannied. Some toys don't have a volume control setting or the lowest setting is still intensely loud which gets super annoying when you've been listening to the toy for hours/days/weeks. A piece of clear packing tape will significantly cut down on the sound. 

Don't use regular tape though as it peels up too easily and kids can choke on it. Packing tape stays put and because it's more clear they won't  notice it.
