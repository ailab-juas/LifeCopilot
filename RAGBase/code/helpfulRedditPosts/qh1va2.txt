YSK about the post offices "General Delivery" for those without an address. It's free and requires no application.

Why YSK: the smallest P.O. Box is $70/3 months. $70 upfront. My situation is that the barn that was given to me to teach a free class to teenagers on how to remove engines from cars and install new ones, it's address belongs to the house next to it, and the barn itself actually needs its own address because people live in the house. The properties are separate but share the same address.

Go to your local post office, ask for general delivery instructions, and they will tell you how to receive mail to that post office. 

My city only has one post office, so to format the address on my envelopes, it's simply:



Name

General Delivery

City, State Zip



Also, don't forget to put in a change of address to whatever format the post office gives you.

Edit: address format
