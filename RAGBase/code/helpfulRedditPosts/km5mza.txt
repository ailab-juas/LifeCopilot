LPT: If your spouse is cleaning a section or area of the house, and you feel inspired to pitch in, choose a different area of the house to clean, unless they specifically ask you for help.

I just came up on my 15th anniversary with my beautiful wife. 

I noticed that on the weekends or in the evenings when one of us starts cleaning around the house, it will spur inspiration for the other one to clean as well. 

But so many times I’ve made the mistake of seeing my wife in the kitchen cleaning and thinking to myself, I want to support her efforts, so I start cleaning around her in the kitchen. 

HUGE mistake... my good intentions quickly turn into her felling like I don’t approve of the job she’s doing so I “had to step in”, when really I just wanted to help. 

Instead, when inspiration strikes to support my wife and her cleaning efforts, whenever I choose a different part of the house to clean, she notices it and is pleased.

It’s the same thing in reverse too... if I’m cleaning the kitchen and she comes in and starts opening and shutting cabinets right next to me, I csn get annoyed. And then I realize that I do the same thing to her. 

Live and let live. You can’t change anybody. You can only change how you react to anybody.
