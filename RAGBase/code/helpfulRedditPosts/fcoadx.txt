title:
YSK that if your pet has gotten skinny and shows lack of strength it may have a dental problem that makes it too painful to eat properly. get soft food and take your pet to the vet before it starves to death.

a dear friend of mine just lost a pet recently after it got skinny under it's fluff of hair.  after watching several reality vet shows and repeatedly seeing how animals dropping weight is often due to painful chewing (leading to malnutrition and starvation) i realized that this may have been the issue my friend's pet had.  if you have an older pet it is easy to assume that weight loss is just a natural progression of old age.  you may have more time with your pet than you think just by getting their teeth checked and taken care of.

edit: there are a lot of comments along the lines of "how could you not notice if your pet stops eating?"

my friend's tiny pet continued to eat regularly, but not enough to maintain its weight.  food was never measured, the feeding bowl was huge, and the pet was free fed.
