LPT; Occasionally walk up to your immediate supervisor and ask for some constructive criticism. Be specific by asking something like "What could I have done better on the Penske files?". Whatever they say, just respond thank you and walk away.

Once I learned this after being  a defensive person, it freed me from so much anxiety. I initiate the criticism, I take in the info and walk away. Now I hope this manger won't have an issue with coaching me in fear of being an excuse maker. And they will know I am open to growth . The latter part of my career went much better by doing this. 


**EDIT** To be clear a couple of key things. 

* This will not work with POS managers that are the worst to work with. They don't care, they will not be promoted and if they stick around with that company, it is an indictment of the company's over all culture and you should start looking for a better employer.

* If this type of behaviour is not in your repertoire **but** you really want to be a better employee, bring this up after your next review or privately that you are looking to change your ways. If it is not sincere don't waste everyone's time in my opinion. 

**EDIT 2** Thanks everyone. This was one of those posts I expected to get buried in a matter of moments. Thank you for letting me share my perspective.
