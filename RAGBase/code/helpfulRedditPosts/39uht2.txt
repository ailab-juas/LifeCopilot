title:
LPT: If you're overheating for whatever reason, run your wrists under cold water.

content:
You can also do this to the back of your neck, your temples, your ankles, or your feet but your wrists usually don't require taking off any articles of clothing or getting your shirt wet or anything. Water can be substituted with cooling scarves or wet bandannas or whatever you have on hand.

The reason this works is because those spots are where the blood flows closest to your skin, so if you can cool that off it will help bring your temperature back down, quickly, in only a few seconds!

(PS: this is obviously not a replacement for being properly hydrated or anything, but it helped me out last night so I thought I'd share.)
