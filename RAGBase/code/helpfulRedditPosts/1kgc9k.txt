Looking for good music to work to? Try video game soundtracks. The music's designed to provide a stimulating background that doesn't mess with your concentration.

I spend a lot of time coding and writing on my computer. I have trouble concentrating without some kind of music in the background, but have even more trouble concentrating if that music has lyrics. Classical and other instrumental music is great but I find myself really wanting to pay attention to it instead of the task at-hand, and techno can be a bit overwhelming.

Several months ago I bought two albums of video game music "greatest hits" performed by an orchestra, and it's been my go-to work music ever since. I'm no expert, and very very rarely play video games, but it seems like it'd stand to reason that this music is designed to provide an ambient background for the listener that doesn't detract from — and may actually help — their ability to concentrate on mental tasks.

Listening to a bunch of MIDIs from SNES games, maybe not so much. But symphonic remakes of game music has been great for me.

If anyone has recommendations it would be really appreciated!
