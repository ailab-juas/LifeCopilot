LPT: When moving into a new apartment, take pictures of any existing damage and store them on a cloud service, like GDrive or Dropbox, so when you move out you have indisputable timestamped photos of existing damage if management tries to blame you.

When my fianc√©, now wife, was moving into her apartment, I took lots of photos of existing damage then stored them on my Google Drive in a folder, then set it aside. (If you're concerned about your privacy with an online cloud service, well, the apartment is empty so I mean...not much to takeaway from that)   
   
When we went to move her out to move into our house, management tried to blame existing damage on her/our dog and I was able to pull out photos of existing damage. When they said we could have taken them at anytime, I just pointed out the photo timestamp AND upload date. That was the first time she ever got her full deposit back. Management almost always blamed her husky for damage (I repaired the only actual damage she did with some spackle and paint).   
   
Related: Also, find out exactly what management expects of you from moveout. My apartment straight up replaced the carpet, paint job, and did a full cleaning after every tenet so they literally told me I didn't have to do cleaning at all because their service does it, and sure enough I got my deposit back. I still did a light cleaning and pick up to not be an utter savage.  
   
Edit: Amazon Photos is another good option if you have Prime. Unlimited photo storage is included with your subscription.
