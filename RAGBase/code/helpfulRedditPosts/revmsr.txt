LPT: Frozen vegetables are often cheaper, more time-saving, and HEALTHIER than supermarket "fresh" vegetables. This is the ultimate short cut for those who aren't eating enough vegetables.

**Healthier**: I recently learned that studies have found that some frozen vegetables give you MORE nutrients after being frozen, while others give you less. But overall, frozen vegetables that come in big packs will give you nutritional value that is equal or greater than "fresh" vegetables from the supermarket, which have gone through transportation and nutrient loss.

**Cheaper and time-saving**: If you buy a big pack, you can get 4 or 5 different items already prepared for a very low amount. I bought two big packs of frozen vegetables for 30 to 50 meals each for about $8 at Costco. It is very difficult to waste vegetables that are frozen, and yet vegetables that you buy yourself and keep in the fridge can spoil rather quickly if you don't have a well-rehearsed routine. Having a variety pack saves you so much prep time, as well.

**Microwave?** It seems that still too many people either scoff at the microwave, or have unscientific beliefs about it. [Actually, microwaving vegetables is healthier than steaming, which is often regarded as the healthiest way to eat vegetables. (Harvard Health)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/microwave-cooking-and-nutrition) Using a tiny bit of water with vegetables in the microwave, you are essentially steaming the vegetables inside out, very rapidly. Of course, it is more delicious to stir fry your vegetables or bake them, but what if you don't have the time? A microwave takes only 4 to 5 minutes to cook, and the only prep is putting it in a dish, adding a small splash of water, and covering it. It is the easiest way to add some vegetables to whatever else you're eating.
