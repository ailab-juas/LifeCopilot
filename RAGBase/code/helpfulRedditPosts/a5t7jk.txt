LPT: If you receive a PS4 for Christmas Day this year – for sanity's sake – don't click "update" on either the software update or any game updates. Depending on your internet speeds, you will spend Christmas Day waiting for it to download and install. Do it later... like in 2019.

**Redditor azninvasion2000** has a great tip below how to **pre-download and update via USB.**
