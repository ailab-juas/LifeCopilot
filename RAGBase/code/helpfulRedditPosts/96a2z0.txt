LPT: If you are struggling to focus on work/studying, try listening to some video game soundtracks. Most instrumental soundtracks are designed to make you focus, and since they don't have lyrics, they can help improve your productivity without being intrusive to your thoughts.

So, of course everyone is different. Some people like working in total silence, others like blasting and singing along to their favourite songs. I've personally found that by using videogame OSTs, I can block out the outside world and distractions, and focus on work much better.

Here are some of my personal favourites OSTs to work to.
