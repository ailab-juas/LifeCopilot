YSK that archive.org has millions of books available for free, many of which are hard to find elsewhere on the internet

Why YSK: if you're doing homework, research, etc. and you are asked to consult a specific book which you don't possess, can't buy (either bc it's expensive or bc it's an old edition) and can't go to a library or get it another way, you can search there, and you may find it. For online class i was asked to cite an article of my country's civil code which was derogated, and no pdf had those articles, but i was able to find a version from the 1930s there. I've also found a couple textbooks which i needed for brief research.
