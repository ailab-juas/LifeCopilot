LPT Take picture's of your passport when traveling.

content:
Probably has been said a million time but when traveling/working abroad take pictures of your important documents specially your passport. Today doing so saved me and my wife in 2 different instances. My wife forgot her passport when going for in-processing to her new job. Had a picture of her passport in my email and they accepted the phone picture as proof. Later today I forgot my wallet in my office and went to get gas without realizing. Pumped Â£80 of diesel to my surprise of not having the wallet or any identification. Lucky enough I had my passport picture in the same email and the gas station wrote a voucher to pay later and the attendant used my passport pictire as identification.

Always have copies or pictures of your important documents.

Edit: *pictures not picture's. Additional LPT. Carry a dictionary with you.
