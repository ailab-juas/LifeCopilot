LPT: College students: If you are a victim of a crime at school, call police FIRST, not the school.

content:
Colleges and universities will try to  get you to use their "internal" reporting systems when something bad happens.  That system is there to help the school protect their image, not to protect you.   They will waste valuable time at best, and some may even try to talk you out of filing a police report, or they may even trick  you into reporting to a campus authority instead of to police.  If you want a  law enforcement response, get it yourself.  You can report to the  school later.  The college will have a harder time covering the crime  up if the police are already involved.

Source: I have worked for multiple colleges that pull this kind of crap.

BTW: This is just as true of lower level schools too.  If your kid is assaulted, threatened, or victimized in another criminal way, don't call the principal first, call police first.  Let the principal catch up later.
