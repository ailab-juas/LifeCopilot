LPT: How to make sure your new auto mechanic is trustworthy.

content:
So you've moved to a new town or you need a new mechanic and you want to make sure he or she is trustworthy.  
  
Take your car in for something your car doesn't need. The easiest is for a front-end alignment or to get the wheels rotated and balanced. Tell them you're not sure if it needs it but it's been a while since you've had it serviced and to call before they do any work.  
  
A good mechanic will deny the service since it's not needed. A bad mechanic will do it even tho it's not needed and charge you anyway. A downright rotten mechanic will realize it doesn't need it, not do anything, and still charge you as if they did the work.  
  
This worked for me when I moved to California. I definitely needed my oil changed so I decided to try out the mechanic in my neighborhood. While it was there I asked if he could please rotate and balance the wheels. He called me about an hour later and said the oil was done and that the wheels didn't need to be balanced and rotated. I picked up my car, smiled, said thanks, and now have an honest mechanic for the rest of my life in this area. :)

Edit: Sorry if you think this is terrible advice. I'm not the one that upvoted it so much. I was just passing along something that worked out for me. I had my car serviced not too long before needing my oil change, so the alignment had recently been done along with the tire rotation. Would it be better to go with someone knowledgeable about cars? Obviously. I had just moved here. I didn't know anyone. Is it better to just learn how to work on your own car, sure. That's not the type of thing I'm interested in doing. The car is one problem I'll just throw money at.
