title:
LPT: if you’re worried about your bike getting stolen (or want to be extra careful) buy a small tracker that people usually put on their pet’s collar, remove the seat and place the tracker inside the frame. You don’t want your bike to get stolen in the first place, but now you’re insured if it does.

Edit: Yes, Einsteins, I know that you can buy insurance or lock your bike up. I’m not going to write a fucking post that says “life pro tip: lock up and insure your bike to avoid having it stolen!”

Did you know you can *also* insure and lock up the bike, even if it has a tracker on it? That’s the real life pro tip.
