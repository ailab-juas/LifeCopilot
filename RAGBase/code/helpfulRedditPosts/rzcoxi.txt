Why YSK: A friend of mine had left his name and number at a retirement home incase they needed help getting rid of any cars. A short while later a patient had passed away, next of kin lived states away and asked the retirement home to help selling her loved ones car. My friend got an emasculate low miles car with all receipts for $1000. Good Luck

Edit: *immaculate* not emasculate
