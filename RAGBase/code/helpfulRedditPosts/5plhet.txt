LPT: If an estranged friend starts casually reaching out periodically, listen a bit more closely, ask and keep the conversation going. It could mean something more.

content:
My very close (at the time) high school friend started reaching out not too long ago. He would usually text me or chat me at work, mostly about catching up, current political affairs, or to discuss science. I was usually busy or distracted and would not do my best to follow up with him.

He died today. Won't discuss the details but it was not of natural causes. 

If it seems unusual, give him or her the proper time of day. Otherwise you will have to carry this wrenching feeling of knowing you could have done something more. Stay safe, and don't be afraid to ask directly for help if you need it.

*Just wanted to add, thank you for all your kind words, messages and support. If I could siphon them and somehow make their way to his parents I would. Goodness knows they need it more than I do. 

If you are feeling suicidal, call 1-800-273-8255. There is no shame in this, never.
If you are having substance abuse problems,  1-800-662-4537. https://www.addictioncenter.com/ 
Addiction is a disease. There is no shame in seeking help. It's hard to do this alone, and you are not.
Please, take care of yourselves. You can do this.
