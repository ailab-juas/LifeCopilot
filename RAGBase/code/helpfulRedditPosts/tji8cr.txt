LPT: Conduct an oral history video recording of your parents and grandparents. As they get older and pass away, you’ll be grateful for the recording with their own voice and memories.

I work for a prominent WWII museum as an oral historian. My job was to travel around the country and video record oral histories of WWII veterans. Two years into my job, I brought my camera with me to our family Thanksgiving dinner. Interviewed my mother and father separately for two hours each. I asked them questions of their life BEFORE me. It was only then did I understand why were weren’t a “tell you I love you everyday” family.

Edit: Keep asking questions. I’ll do my best to answer as many as I can. Bio: I interviewed over 400+ WWII veterans over the course of 4 years. Some stories are unbelievable, others seemed to be lost over time. 26 states, 108 cities and 15,000 miles driven. I’m glad I did it.
