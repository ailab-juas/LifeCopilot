LPT: if you think something can be custom made cheaper than a mass-produced item, you’re nearly always wrong.

content:
I run a custom woodworking business and I regularly am asked to quote projects from photos of a clearly mass-produced item from someone else’s catalog or web site. If there’s any way possible that I can make one of an item for less than the retail cost, one of three things is happening:
1. I’m using inferior materials or techniques
2. I’m not paying myself or my employees a living wage
3. I’m not compensating the designer for their intellectual property. 

I generally think it reflects poorly on the person asking, but I realize it’s generally driven by ignorance rather than malice. Hopefully now we’ve taken care of the ignorant part. 

That said, if you want custom, expect to pay double at least what it would cost retail and make sure you really want what you think you want. If I didn’t think there was value in custom work, I wouldn’t be in this business, but I’m not making you a Billy Bookcase cheaper than IKEA.
