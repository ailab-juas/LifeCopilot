YSK about Skiplagged, a travel website that uses hidden-city ticketing to provide you airfares up to 80% less than regular price.

content:
For example, a regular price ticket from Philadelphia to Chicago on May 13th is 146 dollars on Delta Airlines connecting through Cincinnati. However, on Skiplagged.com, a flight from Philadelphia to Chicago is only 66 dollars! The ticket is actually for an itinerary from Philadelphia to Newark, New Jersey, with a 4 hour connection in Chicago. You just don't get on the connecting flight to EWR, and roll in the money you just saved!
