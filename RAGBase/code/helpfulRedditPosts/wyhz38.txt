LPT: when visiting another country, buy spices as your souvenir and cook with them when you get home.

content:
When you visit another country, visit a local supermarket or food store, and grab a bag of spices to take home. They are cheap, small, light, and you'll be motivated to try making the dishes you enjoyed when you return home. It's a nice way to remember your travels. Commercially dried and bagged spices are generally OK to bring into any country AFAIK.
