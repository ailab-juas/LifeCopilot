LPT: for the 100th time, DO NOT badmouth your current company during an interview, even if the interviewer asks why you're looking to leave.

content:
It seems like common sense, but I keep seeing it happen again and again. My partner and I are both hiring for highly sought after jobs, and we keep running into candidates who use the interview to badmouth their current job, talk about how dumb they think their current manager is, or how the work is beneath them. DO NOT DO IT.

This morning, I had a referral from a mutual friend at my old company for a role on my current company, on my team. I decided to do a quick call with the potential candidate to discuss the role, and in 5 minutes, he managed to talk about how terrible my old company is, how much smarter he is than everyone there, and how he thinks he's too qualified for the role he wants me to refer him for. Not sure if he forgot that I used to work at his current company, and the position he thinks he's too smart for is literally on my direct team.

I specifically ask "Why are you considering leaving your current role" in interviews, because it quickly let's me know your intentions. And yes, there are shitty companies and shitty bosses, and yes, it's absolutely fine to leave a company solely to make a couple more bucks, but don't look petty.  It's an interview, not a therapy session for you to vent about your coworker who got promoted over you.

**Here are some general vague responses you can use if you get asked that question. Really, any responses is acceptable, so long as you're professional:**

* My company is great, but I think I'm ready the next step in my career.
* As things have changed at my company, so has the role, and I think I need something that will be a better fit.
* I think I do very good work in my current role, and I think this job would compensate better for my efforts.
* I'm not looking to leave my current company, but when I heard about this role coming open, I knew I had to take the opportunity.

**Good luck out there, and keep it professional.**

EDIT: For followups to re-occurring questions

**To all the people saying "Why do you want us to lie? I gotta keep it real":** You know you can tell the truth without gossiping or badmouthing. If have a bad work environment, or bad manager, it's fine to give that as the reason. But if you go on a 5 minute rant on how all your problems are other people's fault, I'm going to assume you're the common denominator.  Also, I'm sure you give a more *professional* answer when you answer other questions in the interview, so why would this be different?

**To all the people saying some variation "Interviews are bullshit? Why do you need to ask these questions? They're so loaded."** I'm sorry, interviews have been around forever, and will continue to be around. Asking questions to uncover information is the whole point. People lie on their resume *all the time*, and just asking a questions uncovers so many things. I've had people lie about knowing know how to code.  People who reveal they've been fired for truly horrific offenses. People who lied about the most basic things like jobs they had and schools they've attended, so I'm sorry you don't like getting asked questions, but TS. 

**To the people screaming "Maybe if you were a better manager, your employees wouldn't badmouth you":** You clearly didn't understand the assignment.
