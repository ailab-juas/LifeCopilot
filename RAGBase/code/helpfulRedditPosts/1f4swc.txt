LPT: When handling fiberglass insulation, use gloves, but also rub baby powder on your forearms and wrists. The baby powder clogs the pores so the fiberglass doesn't get into them. NO MORE ITCHY IRRITATION.

Edit: Everyone is saying I was wrong about the pores closing. The baby powder apparently covers the pores making it more difficult for the fiberglass fibers to get in them. Thanks for the research guys!
