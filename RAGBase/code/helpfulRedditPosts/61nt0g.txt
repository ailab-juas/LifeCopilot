LPT: If someone brags that they were able to do something that you believe to be simple, don't tell them that. They probably used to have trouble with whatever it was, and are proud of themselves for overcoming it.

content:
If you aren't able to find praise for those types of things, instead of telling the person that the task is easy for you, ask them politely why they had trouble with it in the first place. They'll appreciate that someone cares enough to recognize their struggle.

Edit: I'll admit that "Brag" was a poor word choice for the point I'm trying to get across, but I'm not surprised in the least that so many people are getting upset over this whole post at the same time that they're complaining about people being "too sensitive." Here's another LPT for those of you that are so upset over this suggestion.

&amp;nbsp;

LPT 2.0: If you don't like a piece of advice, you don't have to listen to it. Feel free to live your life to your own standards, and just remember that whatever you do in your own life is your own responsibility, and not the fault of others.
