LPT: If someone close to you has passed away, wait a week or so before sending food or a phone call to their family members. After watching my grandmother get exhausted from phone calls and receiving baskets of cookies, I saw how much she'd appreciate this when everything quiets down.

My grandfather passed away yesterday. Everyone calling in wanted to express their condolences and share their own grief. She received two giant baskets of cookies, a giant gift box of deli meat and salads, and with no room in the fridge, she had to either throw a lot of food away or find someone else to give it to. I could see her grow more and more tired of the calls as the day went on, leaving her to ignore calls.   


Especially with it being harder for people to visit her, I know she'd appreciate a call of kindness or some extra treats later on, when she has more time to receive calls and get through all the food in her fridge.
