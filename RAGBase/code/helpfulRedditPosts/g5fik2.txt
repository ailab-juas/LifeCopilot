LPT: Mute your mic during video calls when your not speaking.

content:
I don't care if this has been said before. Most countries have been in a lockdown for at least a month now. But still people I video call with still don't mute their mic and the larger the group the worse it gets. It means that everyone hears so much echo and background noise. It means that we just keep on getting cut off by your dog barking/any-noise-in-your-house and everyone has to wait a minute before we can continue. Please mute your mic when you're not speaking.

TL;DR I am angry mute your mic

Edit: i can't spell + just reread it, I sound really angry + this should probably be in a different subreddit sorry + this shouldn't have this many upvotes + i now just use push to speak
