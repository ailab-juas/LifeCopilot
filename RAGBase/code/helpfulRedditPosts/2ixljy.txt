The general areas where serial numbers are located

**EDIT:** Holy upvotes batman!

LPT add-on: Many other devices also have their own serial numbers, so if you value something write it down! Who knows when it could get stolen.

**EDIT #2:** Here are also some more links to help fight against theft, courtesy of some comments below:

UK: [immobilise.com](https://www.immobilise.com/index.php), a UK based site where you're able to register your products for free. Police work with the information on here to help track stolen products. 

US: [nationalbikeregistry.com](https://www.nationalbikeregistry.com/), register your bikes here if you're in the US.
