LPT: Move social media apps to a secondary device (like an iPad) to give yourself some distance without having to quit them entirely.

content:
This past week I have been as outraged as anyone else, and been in the streets protesting and sharing as much as possible to all my friends across a variety of platforms.  
  
But a few days ago it just all kinda got to me.  The 24/7 cycle of outrage and abuse just became too much and I needed some distance lest my anxiety take over completely.  
  
So I moved all my social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Reddit) to my iPad instead, and deleted them from my phone.   Now I still have the option to go and check what’s happening several times a day, but gone is the constant *need* to be constantly plugged in and refreshing things 24/7.  
  
Plus this frees up a lot of brain cycles for other things I need to accomplish in my life.  For anyone who is feeling a bit overwhelmed, consider trying this.  You’re not losing anything, as all your apps are still within reach - they’re just no longer intimately integrated with you.
