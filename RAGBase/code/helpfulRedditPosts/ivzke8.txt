LPT: When getting interviewed for a job, interview back

content:
A lot of people hesitate to ask how much they’ll be paid, what’s expected of them and how policies work until they’ve started. They’ll squeeze you for every dime and the moment you clock in they will act like they own you, they don’t and don’t be afraid to ask for the pay you need.

Edit: hey everyone! Thanks for the awards, thats never happened to me before.

but please, dont give them- keep your money or [donate it instead.](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/getmitch) (or [here](https://www.outdoors.org/get-involved/donate), or [here](https://www.donorschoose.org))
