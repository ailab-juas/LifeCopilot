LPT: When traveling, buy a piece of good quality clothing or accessory from each place you visit as a souvenir rather than the typical magnets and keychains. Every time you wear these clothes and accessories, you will be reminded of your trip and relive the happy moments.

Since I travel quite a bit, I hardly buy clothes back home anymore. If I need to buy new clothes, I buy them while on a trip. Even if it's from a brand that exists back home, I still prefer to buy them abroad because I will be reminded of the trip every time I wear that piece of clothing and the happy memories will flood back and make my day a lot happier. :)
