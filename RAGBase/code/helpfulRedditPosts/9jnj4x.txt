LPT: If you have a drain that does not get used regularly, run water in it every 1-2 weeks

content:
In a guest bathroom, for example. After as little as two weeks the drain can start to dry out. If you have a "dry drain" you will start to get a sewer smell in your house. Running the water occasionally will make sure that the drain is "topped off" and stop this from happening.

Edit: To expand, your plumbing will have ["Traps"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_(plumbing\)) that hold water to stop sewer gases from entering your house. That water will evaporate over time if you are not using the sink/tub/toilet that feeds the drain. Running water for ~15 seconds will fill it back up and clear out any standing water.
