YSK that if the emergency vehicle is on the other side of a divided road, you don't have to stop.

Many people have a mild panic when they see emergency lights or hear sirens. If one is approaching you from behind or about to cross the same intersection that you are, pull out of the way as necessary and wait until it has passed. No action is necessary on larger divided roads. When emergency vehicles are driving toward you on the other side of a road with a concrete divider or a median, you [don't have to stop](https://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/move-over-law/).  In fact, stopping randomly in such cases can create traffic danger on your side.

Edit. I think people don't realize that I'm only talking about being on the opposite side of the freeway or a similar road with a hard divider. Earlier today I saw someone stop fairly suddenly in the left lane when there was a fire truck approaching from the other direction on its regular side of the divider. That driver almost caused a pileup by not following the law.
