LPTR: How should you discuss how much you get paid when your friends/family bring it up?

content:
~~My parents always told me never to tell people how much I make. Yesterday, I was at a party and one of my very good friends asked me how much I get paid. It felt like the whole room went silent but I still told him. He was happy for me but I still didn't feel comfortable telling him in that environment. How can I be more prepared for situations where I'm asked about my income? What should I tell them? Should I not tell them? How can I politely tell them I don't want to disclose that information?~~

Edit: Wow, I'm blown away by the responses. Thank you all for your insights, advice, and humor! I've learned that most of you aren't afraid to voice how much you make, others are more inclined to politely dodge the question, and a few are scared to let others now. It saddens me to see that material things still measure a persons value and instill fear. Enough to keep their mouth shut about one of their proudest achievement, that they make money, have a job, and can provide something for themselves or for others.

I've always known that money is the fuel for choices. The more money you make, the more opportunities you have, that's a fact. But jealousy stems from ignorance, hate, prejudice, and uneducated opinions, and I hope nobody goes through that just by announcing their earnings.

I hope that none of you judge a persons merit based on how much coin they carry but based on how they treat you and what they've accomplished. Thank you all again for helping understand how to discuss my wage with others.
