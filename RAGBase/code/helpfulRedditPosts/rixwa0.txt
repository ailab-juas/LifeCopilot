LPT: You can maintain fitness with a tiny bit of exercise everyday by focusing on your largest muscles. Over a year, it amounts to a lot.

I started with 30 squats and 50 push ups a day. Over a year, that is 18250 push ups and 10950 squats. It takes less than two minutes to do both. If you can't do that many, start with whatever you can do. Slowly, you'll be able to do more. I'm up to 150 push ups and 150 squats now and I have less pains in my body.

A lot of people think you need to hit the gym or run for miles, but most people don't have the time or energy. It's better to do something rather than nothing.

Edit: I want to add that the goal is to get people that don't have time, or that aren't doing anything to start small. For me, as I built up strength and energy levels, I found myself being more active in general. It does have to be push ups or squats but whatever works for you.

Oh, and if you can't do 50, start with whatever you can do. Don't worry about the number in the beginning.

If you are looking to lose weight, you will need to change your diet for the better.
