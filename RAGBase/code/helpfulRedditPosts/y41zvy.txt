YSK: An apple watch can be used as a cell phone for kids

 Why YSK:

For parents that are rightfully hesitant to set young kids up with a smart phone, the apple watch is an elegant solution that dilemma.

The watch is used off the parents cell plan, and can be fully monitored. It allows the kid to make calls and texts to approved contacts (mom/dad/grandma/babysitter/911/etc), and the parent can also see their location. And the kid won't have access to any age inappropriate apps.

There may be other smart watches that have this capability, but I'm only familiar with apple's. If anyone knows of other products, please suggest.
