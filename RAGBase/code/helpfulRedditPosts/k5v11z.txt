LPT: Don’t be afraid to lose people. Be afraid of losing yourself by trying to please everyone around you

content:
This LPT is based on personal experiences and I think it’s kind of self explaining. 

I a nutshell many people (including me for a long time) are trying to avoid confrontations with supposed friends and other “related” people, although they are really uncomfortable with the friendships they have. 

Not a long time ago I had a friend which had a very negative impact on me in a psychological way and I always believed I had to be there for her but the truth was, she just wanted to feel better by pulling me down. But i wanted to adapt all the time and became more and more losing myself.  

You don't always have to adapt! 
When you feel to lose yourself around certain people be yourself! 
Name your point of view and don’t be afraid to lose toxic people around you after confronting them.

EDIT: It’s my first post here and I am so overwhelmed by this positive response! Wish you all the best and stay strong!

EDIT2: First I want to thank you for all the awards, it’s really insane!  
Second I want to reach out to all the people in this thread who can relate to my experience and going through a hard time right now. 
I think it shows that we are not alone with this emotions what motived me personally a lot! 
Feel all hugged :)

EDIT3: Some people say in this thread it’s not a real LPT and I can understand what you mean by that. But I think on the other hand an advise can be a LPT and more or less obvious at the same time. 
If someone told me me this advise a few years ago I would be very greatful. 
I read a lot of comments of people who where grateful too and considered this post as helpful. Personally that is what count for to be a LPT at the end.
