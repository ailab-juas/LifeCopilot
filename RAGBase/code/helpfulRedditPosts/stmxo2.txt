LPT: Until you can acknowledge that you did something wrong without adding “but” you haven’t accepted responsibility.

content:
There’s a huge difference between saying:

 “I am sorry I hurt you” 

             &amp; 

“I am sorry you feel hurt”

On the first statement, you acknowledge what you did. You take ownership and responsibility. 

In the second statement, you have recused yourself as the cause of the pain. You are almost mocking the person.
