YSK to remove the X-shaped stitches and open up the vents on your new pants/blazer/skirt.

content:
The vents of these tailored clothing items are temporarily sewn shut for shipping purposes.  Usually the vents are sewn shut using long, loose stitches and a contrasting thread color (e.g. white thread on a black coat).

Cut those threads for a better fitting, more accommodating garment!
