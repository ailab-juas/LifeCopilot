LPT: Be diligent in what charities you donate money to. Some are corrupt corporations hiding behind non-profit status.

After working and seeing behind the scenes of many “charities”, I have seen some pretty unfortunate squandering of funds and little going to the cause they promote. 

Also note that while all charities are non-profit, not all non-profits are charities….

A little research goes a long way when being generous.
