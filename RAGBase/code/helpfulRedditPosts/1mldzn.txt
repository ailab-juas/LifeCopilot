LPT: If you have issues with losing your temper, start doing your menial everyday tasks with your non-dominant hand.

content:
Forgive me for forgetting the stats, but studies have shown that doing everyday tasks with your non-dominant hand greatly increases the ability to control rage.

It's believed to be due to the fact that anger is greatly linked to a feeling of powerlessness or loss of control. Taming this feeling in small doses is an easy way to develop better self-control, and makes it easier to deal with it in more stressful situations. 

(I apologize if this infringes of the no medical advice rule.)
