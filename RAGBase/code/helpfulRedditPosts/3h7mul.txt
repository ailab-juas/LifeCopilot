LPT: Always keep a safety pin on your key ring so you can fasten your keys to the inside of your pocket when you're worried about losing them (running, rollercoasters, etc.)

The little loop hole on the end of a safety pin fits perfectly on a key ring. I use this every time I go running so my keys don't fall out of my small pockets. Also, it's nice to have a safety pin handy whenever you may need one.
