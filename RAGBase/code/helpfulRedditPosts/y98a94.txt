LPT: Afraid to open and clean out your Tupperware because the thing growing inside is nearly sentient? Freeze it, briefly thaw it, and neatly toss it!

content:
We're all guilty of growing science experiments in our fridges, and if you're like me, you can't handle the guilt of throwing away your good glass Tupperware but your stomach churns at the thought of smelling that mess while trying to spoon it all out.

Instead, just pop it in the freezer overnight, letting it freeze into a solid block. Then just take it out, flip it upside down, and run it under hot water until the solid block unsticks from the Tupperware. Now you're safe to open it and chuck out your non-smelly block of lord knows what.

EDIT: Some good comment tips: use cold water instead of hot for glass to prevent shocking and shattering it. Might want to label it so you don't think it's food. But don't name it. Never name it.
