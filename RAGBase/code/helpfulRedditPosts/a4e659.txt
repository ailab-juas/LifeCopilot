YSK that “DD” breasts aren’t as big as you think they are, and without the band size you could be referencing anything from kiwis to cantaloupes.

You often see people referencing breasts on a scale of A-DD from smallest to largest. In reality though, D-DD is at the relatively small-average end of the scale. While many big box stores only go up to D-DD (the source of confusion I believe), stores that specialize in bras have a scale like this-


US: A, B, C, D, E (DD), F (DDD), G, H, I, J, K+...

UK: A, B, C, D, DD, E (DDD), F, FF, G, GG... 


**The importance of band size**


Going back to the kiwi and the cantaloupe, I brought that up because you can have two women who wear a size DD, but the actual volume of breast tissue can be wildly different. For example-


28C vs 34C

These are two different band sizes  with the same cup size. *Proportional to their bodies*, it’s the same size, however the 28C is going to be a smaller breast than the 34C. This is where it gets a bit confusing. Bras have a concept called “sister sizing” where if you go down a band, you go up a cup size. So if you were to take those 34Cs and reduce them to a 28 band equivalent, you’d convert roughly to a 28DDD. That girl with the 28DDD sounds like she has huge boobs, but they are the “same” size as a 34C which doesn’t sound quite so big. Proportionally the 28DDD has more breast tissue compared to chest than the 34C, but someone still may not think that they look very “big”. 


You simply can’t have a blanket image for what a “DD” breast should look like, because it depends on who’s body it’s on.

I am sharing this information because I think that understanding these sizes can be very beneficial. It helped me to find my proper fit and be more comfortable, but even so, someone may scoff at me for sharing my size because it “doesn’t look *that* big”. I think that if more people were educated on sizing, it would lift a lot of ignorance from the whole subject-for males *and* females who don’t yet know these things.
