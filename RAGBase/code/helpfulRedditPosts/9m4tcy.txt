LPT: When adopting or purchasing an animal, ask yourself "Will this animal be with me, regardless of my financial, employment, housing or relationship changes?" If the answer is "No", you are not a suitable owner.

Having a pet is a commitment and sometimes commitments are hard to make. Asking yourself this question prior to adopting or purchasing an animal will prevent you from making a big mistake, while hopefully leaving that animal for a better suited owner.
