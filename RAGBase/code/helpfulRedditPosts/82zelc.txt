LPT: Want a good dog? Take them with you everywhere you go. There is a reason that dogs of street people are amazing, and cooped-up condo dogs are hyperactive spaz dogs.

content:
Ever notice how homeless people who have dogs - their dogs are amazingly calm, follow their owners everywhere?  They have life experience.  They've been out, seen the world a lot, socialized a lot, and just want to follow and hang out with their owners.  
If you were kept in a room your whole life, you'd freak and spaz and mis-behave the couple of times a day you were let out too.

(I have been working with dogs for over 20 years)


EDIT:  I should note that no, I don't take them into restaurants to mooch off diners, let them run around on airplanes, or through grocery stores to pee in aisle 6.  I thought that would go without saying, but I guess not.  :)

EDIT:  People on reddit seem to take everything literally.  When I say everywhere I mean everywhere that you can.  Again, I didn't think I needed to specify this doesn't mean 24/7 go to the movies with them, play tennis with them, etc.

ALSO:  NO WARM CARS with the windows up!!
