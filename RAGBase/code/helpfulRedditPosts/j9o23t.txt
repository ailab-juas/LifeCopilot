YSK Never Chase Running Dog

content:
Why YSK  
dogs instinctively run in the opposite direction when they’re being chased (whether they think it’s from danger or they think it’s a game). if you can get their attention long enough for them to look back at you than:
1- run the in opposite direction. your dog is most likely to chase after you because they think it’s a game and dogs love to chase
2- if you’re in a safe place to do so (not in the middle of the street, etc) drop to the ground and lay down. your dogs instinctive curiosity and care for you will take over and they’ll likely run back to check and make sure you’re ok 
3- YELP!! don’t scream, don’t shout their name, but make a high pitch yelping sound (similar to the way your dog will do when they’re sad, hurt, or upset). chances are your pup will stop in his tracks and (again instinctively) rush to your aid.
