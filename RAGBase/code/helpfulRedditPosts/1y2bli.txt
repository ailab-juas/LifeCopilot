title:
YSK "Light" orange juices are just half water

content:
The Trop50,  and other half sugar, half calorie orange juices are just the normal product with filtered water added.  So save your money if you buy these and just keep a jug and mix your own at home. You get twice as much out of one bottle of regular oj.

Edit: Front page for OJ,  sweet!
