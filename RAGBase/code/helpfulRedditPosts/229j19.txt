LPT: If you're dropping somebody off at their home, make sure that they are able to get in before you drive away.

This only came to mind last night as I was given a lift home after work at 2am by a colleague. As soon as I got out of the vehicle they said goodbye and drove off before I had a chance to reach my door. I had my keys on me but my mobile phone was out of battery; if I'd have forgotten my keys I would have practically been stranded.
