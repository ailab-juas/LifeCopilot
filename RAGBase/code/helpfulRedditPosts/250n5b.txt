LPT: To stop a crying toddler, distract them with an odd request.

If you have a baby tearing up over something not worth crying over, distract them from the situation. Make them use their brain by asking them to do something random. It's pretty easy to make babies *focus* on other things, but the key is to make them *think*. It's not enough to show them something like a stuffed animal â€” that doesn't really disrupt their attention.
