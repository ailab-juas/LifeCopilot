title:
YSK that toddlers’ elbows can dislocate easily, so you should never swing them or lift them by the hand

content:
why YSK: the ligaments in kids’ elbows are still loose, so dislocating their elbow (an injury known as Nursemaid’s elbow) is one of the most common injuries in young kids. once it happens, it’s common for it to reoccur in the future.

it mainly affects kids younger than 5 years old.

you should also never tug or jerk a child’s hand or arm.
