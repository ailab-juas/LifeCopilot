title:
LPT Be open to different perspectives on current issues, but walk away when it feels like an argument. Studies have shown that when two people argue about beliefs, each person is only convincing themselves of how right they are.

I found this in a study about belief perseverance and confirmation bias. It actually makes total sense and I am very guilty of it.

When I argue with my dad about covid-19, I totally obliterate his points, but he just moves onto a different one and doesn’t acknowledge his err. 

And basically this is what we’re both thinking while arguing-

me: holy shit I’m so on fire right now, knocking down all his points with facts and logic and proof and links and 

hm: holy shit there is so much evidence that this virus isn’t real, even if she twists information about one thing, I can think of endless other examples using simple logic, I don’t even need fake news to prove my point like she does


By arguing we do more harm than good for our cause. 


Now I feel out if people are trying to understand my perspective, or only listening so they can argue against it. I’ve wasted a lot less time typing to people who are just going to end up feeling more right than ever. 




I should put a disclaimer that this is referring to one-on-one’s, and not meant to be a commentary on protesting or advocating for the rights of others.
