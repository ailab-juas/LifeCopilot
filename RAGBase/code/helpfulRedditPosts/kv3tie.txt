title:
LPT: When you host a party, create a Spotify / Apple Music playlist, include a link to it on the invite and task each guest with adding a couple of songs to it. People love hearing their favourite songs at a party and it takes the guesswork out of creating a playlist that will appeal to all.

content:
Make sure you preface your request by asking that people only choose party-specific songs (or whatever other preference you have).

Also, have a bunch of your own party songs pre-loaded on the play-list to give people an idea of mood/genre.

*Disclaimer: For many people, this is an LPT for post COVID. I hope everyone is keeping safe in the meantime.*

Edit:

**Regarding the risk of people adding silly songs to the playlist / adding duplicate songs:** ensure you do an audit on the day of the party, and lock the playlist so no-one can make further edits.

**If you are concerned with what the flow of music at the party will be like:** ask people to stick to a couple of specific genres.

**Regarding 'giving people homework' before a party:** you don't have to make it compulsory.
