LPT: If you drop something small in the sink, rather than trying to grab it before it goes down the drain, quickly cover the drain with your hand and let the object settle against your hand

Ever drop a ring or a screw in the sink and desperately try to grab it before bounces down the drain where it'll be a pain (if not and involved project) to remove? Cover the drain with your hand instead!

I had a nose ring and for years the tiny ball at the end of the ring would occasionally fall off as I was washing my face or brushing my teeth. I realized that it FAR more effective to quickly cover the drain with your hand and let the ball settle rather than trying your luck grabbing at it before it disappears.
