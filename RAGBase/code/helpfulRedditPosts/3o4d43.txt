LPT: Here is a homemade dog de-skunking formula that works.

content:
I did it this morning on a face-sprayed (and super-fuzzy) Siberian Husky and he's stink-free already. He'll be *dry* in like a month, but it was worth it.

• 1 quart hydrogen peroxide solution (3%)
• 1/4 cup baking soda
• squirt of dish soap

Mix it together and wash your skunked dog with this stuff as if it were shampoo. Concentrate on wherever Fido got sprayed, of course. Let it sit in just a minute or two then rinse off. No more stinky dog.

I did a double batch but wound up not needing all of it, so I'll report later how well it stores -- unless a chemistry expert would like to chime in.
