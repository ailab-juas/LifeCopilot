title:
YSK about these positive and happy subreddits

content:
After an intense and saddening week in American and across the globe (don't forget about the earthquake in China, the constant fighting in Syria and elsewhere, etc), you should all consider checking out these wonderful subreddits (add more in the comments!  I'll try to update the main post as you add them and add a description if the title isn't clear):

* /r/happy

* /r/UpliftingNews 

* /r/goodnews (many links are to the good-news guardian.  Christian "trigger warning."  Atheists of reddit, if you don't like Christian themed subs, you may not want to go here.  Alternatively, mod /u/cocoon56 has informed me that they don't want all the posts to come from Good News Guardian, so please submit your own links from other sites and help the sub grow!)

* /r/awesome 

And for fun, check out:

* /r/pareidolia

* /r/perfectloops 

* /r/birdswitharms 

* /r/TreesSuckingOnThings (alternatively from /u/Gottheit check out /r/TreesSuckingAtThings)

* /r/SurrealGifs (as /u/Mental_octo) points out, this one can be kinda 50/50.  I love it because it's weird and awesome, but there are certainly some creepy gifs on here.)

Enjoy these.  I have an entire account dedicated to nothing but happy and fun things for when I don't want to be consumed by whatever terrible news is going on in the world today, and that's what's on the list.  What is on your list?

From /u/KittyBotMew:

/r/MakeupAddiction, /r/FancyFollicles (I added this one, thanks!), and /r/SkincareAddiction (she added an s on the end accidentally.  There is no s)

From /u/cowguru and /u/MericaMan4Life: /r/happycrowds  (thanks, I'm totally adding this one!)  

From the above sub, I found these in the sidebar: /r/MadeMeSmile, /r/GoodDeedOfTheDay, /r/SurpriseAppearances (can't speak to the quality.  Never been to any of them until now, but they look good).

From /u/ThumbtacksHurt check out /r/Frisson for videos or music that cause a "passing sensation of excitement"

From /u/macgeekgrl: /r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon 

From /u/AlwaysGoingHome: /r/unlikelyfriends and /r/animalsbeingbros

From /u/tillandsia: /r/HappyBirthday (what a neat idea!)

From /u/purplelephant: /r/zen

From /u/DeceivedCloud: /r/boobs and /r/TinyTits (These are NSFW)

From /u/DeathByReach: /r/FreeCompliments 

From /u/DarthContinent: /r/GetMotivated (this one is actually already on my alt account too, I just didn't add it here since it's so big.  If you're interested in motivation, check out /r/productivity as well!)

From /u/TragicEther: /r/happygirls (Some NSFW, some SFW)

From /u/ArgonGryphon: /r/birdpics (for those of us that prefer our birds with wings and not arms)

From /u/i_shit_on_your_life and /u/l0l_cabbage: /r/asmr (From the sidebar: "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a physical sensation characterized by a pleasurable tingling that typically begins in the head and scalp, and often moves down the spine and through the limbs.")

From /u/FodderFodderFodder:  /r/trees, /r/entwives, /r/stonerswhocare,  /r/meditation, /r/randomactsofpizza, and /r/trollxchromosomes (lady themed comics and such)

From /u/l0l_cabbage: /r/ASMRmusic 

From /u/PenisMcCumcumber: /r/Christianity (PenisMcCucumber states it is friendly to all religions and atheists- if you're not interested in religious content, do not go here)

From /u/Buskers: /r/lachenfreude (deriving pleasure/luaghter from the ~~misfortune~~ laughter of others.  A similar sub is /r/ContagiousLaughter )

From /u/KerasTasi: /r/progresspics (weight loss and muscle gain progress pics)

From /u/Libbits: /r/FaithInHumanity

From /u/HDfried: /r/trees (Enjoy your holiday, buddy!  Stay safe, stay home, have fun).

From /u/rays_of_sunshine: /r/Cinemagraphs (beautiful still moments with single elements of movment in gif form)

From /u/cocoon56: A new sub called /r/upliftingtrends (dedicated to areas of the world/science/poverty improving.  Nothing there yet, go add to it!)

From /u/Knigel: /r/Pronoia (opposite of paranoia- that people are conspiring to do good deeds)

From /u/capt_ishmael: /r/Polandball (description from capt_ishmael: They make comics. Each country is personified by a ball colored like that countries flag. Each ball has the personality of that country. It requires looking up histories of countries to get the jokes sometimes, but that is why I like it. Some of them are hilarious, some merely educational, but most are pretty good.)

From /u/WinkMe: /r/MotivationVideos

From SaintPhoeniix: /r/randomactsofkindness

From /u/ordona: /r/corgi

From /u/talon999: /r/infectioussmiles

From /u/silkypepp: /r/drunk 

From /u/mittensfluffnstuff: /r/MMFB (sub devoted to making people feel better.  Note, this isn't a classically fun or happy sub, it's where you might want to go if you need an emotional boost, or if you want to give one.  Please know that if you are depressed, you can get help.  Stop by the wonderful folks over at /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch for help, resources, and support.  The suicide hotline number is 1-800-273-8255)

From /u/leftanantcolonel, a number of freebie subs:  /r/freebies, /r/AUSfreebies (Only for Australia), /r/CANFreebies (Canada), /r/KindleFreebies, all about free-ebooks, also /r/eFreebies 

**You guys are amazing.  Thanks for bringing attention to all these wonderful subs!**

Lastly, while this is still on the YSK front page, I might as well do a shameless plug.  If you're interested in psychology, head on over to /r/IntroPsych.  It's a college level psychology class hosted by myself and /u/Comicspedia.  We taught it last fall, but are always happy to answer new questions.  Enjoy the class, and there's a link of all the classes in the sidebar to make it easier to find them.  Thanks for stopping by!
