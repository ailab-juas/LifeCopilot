LPT: Use Internet Explorer or Safari to stream Netflix. Other browsers such as firefox, opera and chrome are limited to 720p!

content:
Even though you can manually force the bitrate, Chrome, firefox and opera can't stream 1080p! Using IE or Safari will solve this.

Edit: Its also worth pointing out if you're using windows 8 / 10 you can get the netflix app which not only supports 1080p but also 5.1 surround sound!

Edit2: Loads of people asking about all different setups, so here's what people have generally been saying:

Xbox one, PS4 and the native windows app will support aunt to 1080p and also support 5.1 surround sound.

Microsoft Edge will do 1080p.

No browsers will do surround sound.

The cause is apparently Netflix DRM based and therefore won't affect other services unless they do the same.

Apparently "Chrome on ChromeOS does not have this limitation and will do 1080p."
