LPT: (For junkies) There's no such thing as "Just one more time"

content:
When trying to get clean off addicting drugs, there is no such thing as "I'll just do it ONE more time, then I'll get help".

To quit you have to be in the mindset that you do not want this anymore AT ALL. If you're thinking "I'll just do it one more time then quit". 99% of the time, you won't quit. You have to REALLY want to quit and not do it EVER again.
