LPT: Cut the bottom of your shower liner to avoid water pooling / delay mildew.

content:
My shower liner used to extend to the base of my tub and bunch up a little, causing water to pool and mildew to form over time. I cut off two inches from the bottom of my liner, and now there's no way for water to pool and I've noticed my liners last much longer before getting gross.

Note that the liner still extends past the lip of the tub, so it continues to serve the function of protecting the rest of the bathroom from getting drenched when one takes a shower.

Edit:
Thanks for all the responses! Years-long lurker, made a comment eight months ago and finally decided to post something. To address a common observation: the apartment complex I live in has the shower rod screwed into the wall--it's unadjustable. Reddit is beautiful and terrifying.
