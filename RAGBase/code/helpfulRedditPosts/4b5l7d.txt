LPT: Add an estimated time to completion on every task of your to-do lists.

content:
If you are a serial procrastinator like myself, you may have found to-do lists useful. However it can feel overwhelming when little tasks add up.

Adding the time needed to accomplish them makes you notice how little it will take. "Doing the dishes (15 min)" feels less a pain when you have been on Reddit for 2 hours already. It also feels good to see when you overestimated the time and you can now go back to procrastinating.
