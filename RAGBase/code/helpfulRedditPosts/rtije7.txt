LPT: Play video games with your kids/nephews sometimes. It may seem like a waste of time, but it’s not.

content:
Kids now play video games a lot, and usually enjoy it more than anything. Telling them to get off and go play outside or something like that simply won’t go across. I’ve seen countless posts on r/Minecraft and other communities about it older relatives starting to play with their other relatives and they LOVE it. Especially in games where you can interact with their characters, it can make some real memories. I personally would be ecstatic if my relatives reached out to me about playing a game with them. Video games don’t have to be a waste of time as long as you’re bonding with your relatives. Besides, you might even start enjoying it yourself.

EDIT: and nieces
