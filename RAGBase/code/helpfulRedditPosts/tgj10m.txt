YSK in several Airbnbs hidden cameras were found. On arrival, do a common sense search for secret cameras just in case, focusing on the private areas (holes in ceiling, power outlets, alarm clocks, etc.)

Why YSK: Protect yourself from creeps breaching your privacy.

Even though it is against the policy of Airbnb to have hidden cameras, it does happen and could be considered criminal activity.

Pay attention to smoke detectors, radios, outlets and any flashing lights. Some people have pointed out that looking at your room through a phone camera could expose some infrared cameras (look up how to on youtube).
