[LPT] If you suffer from anxiety or an uncomfortable feeling of butterflies in your stomach, simply wash your face with cool water. An effect called the "diving reflex" will instantly lower your heart-rate substantially, helping you calm down.

Edit: For the best effects, you should fully submerge your face in ice cold water for about 40 seconds - 1 minute (obviously don't drown yourself or push yourself too much, do whatever time is comfortable for you), although in my experience even splashing your face with ice cold water has managed to disrupt feelings of anxiety for me.
