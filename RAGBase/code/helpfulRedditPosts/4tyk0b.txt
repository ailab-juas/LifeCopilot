title:
LPT: Write "Negotiable" for Salary Desired in Job Application.

content:
Had a job interview recently and put "Negotiable" under the Desired Salary box. This was something i learned from /PersonalFinance but I never expected it to work (in my mind). 

The job posted its minimum and maximum they would offer, and the range was more than 25% from lowest to highest. They called me back offering the position and said that "No negotiation was needed" and offered me the max salary for the position. I would of NEVER put the actual max amount in that salary box but by putting "Negotiable" it saved me a lot of stress and worked out for the best.

**EDIT**

Looks like too many people are taking this as a scapegoat to putting an actual number, but thats not how I inteded it to be. I literally ment write "Negotiable" and you should actually, i repeat, be ready to NEGOTIATE your salary. That is the whole point, its pretty simple. Yes you may know your worth, you may not. Putting a value may "lock" you in, when there is always room for negotiation... most cases.

**EDIT 2**
Took a nap and this exploded! Thanks for gold!
