LPT: everyone, eventually will suffer from sarcopenia, the natural progressive loss of muscle mass, if you start hitting the gym and work with weights you'll have a way better life after your 40s than if you don't

Ever wondered why there are people in their 70s who can do any daily task, move weights, do any sort of job and need no help in anything? why is that? how there are people at 60 that need help to even walk? 

that's Sarcopenia, the natural loss of muscle mass that happens with ageing, BUT if you just train your muscles, this won't happen or will happen at a way slooower rate because your body will know that it needs those muscles so it won't let them decay.

Doing good muscle train is by far the best healthcare insurance you can do for your body, at any given point of your life, is never too late to start! From a $$$ point of view, it will save you so much money from hospitals, doctors, injuries etc, and even if you find yourself in a need of surgery, a body with a nice % of muscle mass will perform way better during the surgery and will recover faster afterwards!

bonus fact: a body properly trained needs more calories than one that isn't, so ye, basically the more you are fit, the higher % of muscle mass you have and the more you can eat cause your body naturally burns more to sustain all of those muscles!

TL;DR: hitting the gym and training your muscles against resistance will send the message to your body that it NEEDS muscles, this will prevent the disease known as Sarcopenia which is the progressive loss of muscle by ageing.
