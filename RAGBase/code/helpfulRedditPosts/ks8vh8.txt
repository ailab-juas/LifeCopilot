[How to Debate Like a Manipulative Bully](https://thepowermoves.com/ben-shapiro-debate-techniques/) — It is worth pointing out that once you understand these tactics those who use them start to sound like whiny, illogical, and unjustifiably confident asshats.

Any time you feel yourself start to get regularly dumbstruck during any and every argument with a particular person, remind yourself of these unethical and pathetically desperate tactics to avoid manipulation via asshat.

Also, as someone commented, a related concept you should know about to have the above knowledge be even more effective is Cognitive Bias and the associated concept of Cognitive Dissonance:

EDIT: Forgot a link.

EDIT: Added Cognitive Bias, Cognitive Dissonance, and Cognitive Distortion.

EDIT: Due to the number of comments that posed questions that relate to perception bias, I am adding these basic links to help everyone understand [fundamental attribution error](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error)  and other [social perception biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_perception). I will make a new post with studies listed in this area another time, but [this one that relates to narcissism](http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_kammrath_mindreading.pdf) is highly relevant to my original train of thought when writing this post.
