Why YSK:

I have been using the Live 10 Suite version of ableton for a couple years, and I consider it to be the best software there is in terms of making music. Although the lite version is a little less featureful, there are plenty of free plugins and VST instruments that are super polished and sound awesome.

&gt; Note: This is offer only lasts until 2020-12-24, but if you get it you should have access forever!

Good free VSTs include:
- [Vital](https://vital.audio/)
- [Helm](https://tytel.org/helm/)
- [Melda Audio's free bundle](https://www.meldaproduction.com/)
- [Spitfire LABS](https://labs.spitfireaudio.com/)
- [Keyzone Piano](https://vst4free.com/plugin/2848/)

Edit: Wow this blew up, honestly didn't expect anything of this caliber at all. I hope I can get to answer a few more comments in the next hour or so. I've also updated the VST list with links (thanks, u/devinviss!) and a link to the actual page where you can get it (thanks, u/Roygbiv856!).
