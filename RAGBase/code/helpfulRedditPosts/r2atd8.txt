LPT: When a friend or family member is in debt, and asks you for a loan because the banks won't - Only agree if you don't mind not getting it back.

It might sound counterintuitive because you 'know them better', but the bank's entire job is to figure out who's too risky to lend to. If they won't offer a loan (even when they stand to profit!), then they're probably right, and the loan will be nothing but trouble. 

You can still *give* them some money, but make your peace with the assumption that you won't get your money back, or at least not most of it, and not without a serious, relationship straining series of battles over it. This is doubly true of people who're in debt for bad reasons (gambling, etc) - You could offer to pay for essential bills or groceries to make sure the money is going somewhere good, but chances are it'll backfire and they'll get angry, or they'll just use the freed up money to plough right back into however they're wasting it. 

I recently re-learned this the hard way after loaning a friend $600 (it was going to be a lot more) as a way to help put a dent in their credit card debt, and reduce their interest payments so they could start being net positive, paying back the actual CC debt instead of interest and fees driving them deeper in. Well, that $600 immediately went into a black hole and they're still maxed out on the card. Don't assume that just because they're a good friend or a close family member and a nice person etc that they'll put the money to good use or ever pay you back.
