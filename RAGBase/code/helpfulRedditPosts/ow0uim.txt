LPT: The safest way to stop a dogfight is to grab the aggressive dog by the hind legs and pull backwards.

content:
Everybodys instinct is to try to pull their dog to safety.  But the aggressing dog will just continue attacking.  Grabbing the hind legs of the attacker keeps your hands away from the sharps in their mouth as a well as throws them completely off balance.  Then your pet will almost guaranteed run for the hills.

It's not the greatest for their hips.  But it's the lesser of two evils and prevents bites.

Edit: As users have pointed out it is also important to keep moving backward slowly.  This will force them to constantly be off balance, giving them zero leverage.
