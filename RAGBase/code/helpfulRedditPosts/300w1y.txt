LPT: Improve your spelling. When word-check marks a word as wrong, make four attempts to correct it yourself. Even if you get it wrong, you're likely to note where you got it wrong after you've had a go at fixing it yourself.

Me and the word 'sovereign' just had a moment. I've used this technique since high school and there are very few words that I can't spell. I'd just never had to spell that one before.

Edit: I get it I'm a terrible person. And a retard. I won't suggest these kinds of things anymore

Edit 2: Thank you, /u/imozmo, for the gold.

I just got home and this blew up. Kind of surprised by it. It obviously doesn't have to be four times or even this method. I think my main point was to do more than just auto-correct and never look at what you've done wrong. If you learn to spell a word rather than having to go back and select from the list of possible words you could have meant, you save the time that it takes in the future. A stitch in time saves nine.
