YSK that in the United States you don't have to wait 24 hours, 48 hours, or any length of time to file a missing person report.

**Why YSK.** There's a trope in popular entertainment that you can't report someone missing until 24/48 hours, or some other length of time have passed without that person being seen. This is entirely a myth. There is no time limit you have to wait before reporting someone missing. 

In many situations, such as those involving kidnappings, an elderly person with dementia, or someone in psychological distress, waiting to contact police to report someone missing can be harmful. 

Also, you don't have to know the reason why someone is missing, or worry about filing a false report. If you believe someone is missing and are concerned, you can contact police immediately. It's up to them to investigate and determine if your report is accurate, not you.

If you think someone is missing, in danger, or needs help, you can contact your local police first. If you suspect a child is missing, contact the [National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/isyourchildmissing#whattodoifyourchildismissing). 1-800-THE-LOSTÂ® (1-800-843-5678).
