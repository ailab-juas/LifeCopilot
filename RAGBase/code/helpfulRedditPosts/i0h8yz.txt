LPT: When someone asks you to back up your claim with a source, do it.

content:
Far too many people here get offended when someone even mentions the word "source". You all should know that the internet can easily spread misinformation. For example, I can post something and say "Reddit is censoring this" even when Reddit isn't censoring it.

Everyone has the right to be skeptical, and if you're getting offended when asked for a source, then either you're lying 
/Spreading misinformation or you aren't as well informed on the subject as you think you are.

Not to mention, getting offended when asked for a source is a childish, immature thing to do.
