LPT: When applying for a job in person, do it on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday

content:
Monday is the day when issues that occured over the weekend are being dealt with and the office is likely to be busy. Friday is too close to the weekend when things are shutting down and management is elsewhere. You have the best chance of the right people being available and noticing your application in the middle of the week.

Try and be smart, obviously the above will not apply to every wokrplace.
