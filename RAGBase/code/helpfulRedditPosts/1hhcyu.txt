LPT: Rather than 'not finishing your plate' learn what a correct portion size is and stick to it

content:
Portion size is something I think most people over-estimate.  To give you an idea, the appropriate portion size for lean meat for an adult is 3oz or about the size of a deck of cards - yeah, that little! 

Rather than make generic rules about not finishing what's on your plate - learn how much you should be eating and stick to it

[This is a link to WebMD's breakdown of portion sizes](http://www.webmd.com/diet/healthtool-portion-size-plate) - this is geared more for weight control/management, so take it with a pinch of salt (or without, if you're high in blood pressure - yeah, that's a little joke for y'all)

For kids - an appropriate portion size is about the size of their palm - again, that's all! 

Oh, and remember the golden rule - everything in moderation...including moderation
