LPT: Speaking negatively about a person's indefensible traits is an effective way to ensure that person remembers you and the words you speak. In the worst possible way.

**A comment you make about someone, and forget about moments later, may stick with them for the rest of their life.**

In my early 20's, a co-worker told this to a much sharper-tongued version of me, and it had a profound impact on how I treated people from that moment forward.  

I immediately thought about all of the shitty, terrible things that people said to me or about me over the course of my life, and how their words made me feel, and the thought that I had made others feel that way, without even realizing it - countless times,  probably - completely struck me.  

The thought that I could have caused a lifelong, negative impact on someone, and that they associate me, as a person, with some stupid, thoughtless comment was a pretty big thing to take in.  That I could have made fun of something completely indefensible about them, causing them to feel insecure and lack self-esteem for something that they couldn't even help or control.

And that was just thinking about actual in-person interactions, without even considering all of the shit I said to people online in my younger days. 

Hopefully these comments stick with some of you, and it causes a person or two to act less shitty to the people around them, even if they don't like them.  It's a pretty cool thought to consider this same idea, but with a positive impact.
