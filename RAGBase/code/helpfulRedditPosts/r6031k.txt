title:
LPT: Give your man some physical love and attention.

content:
I realised this with my first boyfriend. Men are often starved of physical attention. It seems totally normal and socially accepted for girls to hug, caress, and kiss each other openly to show their friendship and love but men often cannot express their feelings in the same way.

Ladies and gents, give your guy the physical love he probably gives you. Touch his hair, hug him often, let him lay his head in your lap and just caress him. He deserves it and it's time to normalise men craving physical attention besides sex as well!

Edit because you people are absolutely right: bros, give your bros hugs, show and tell them you love them! Men are not machines and want to feel loved by their friends, family and SO.

Another Edit, because again, the comment section has offered great advice: obviously, not everyone is into physical love, platonic or otherwise. As always in life and love, consent is super important. Nobody can know what kind of history a person has and what kind of affection they enjoy!

Also: it's perfectly fine for men to be the little spoon or to be held affectionately. As someone in the comments stated: it doesn't make anyone less of a man to want to be held. It also doesn't make a woman less of a woman if she's the big spoon, as long as everyone is happy, everything is fine!
