LPT: Do the thing your partner procrastinates doing...

content:
I was today years old (at 49) when I realized procrastination by your partner can be the signal of an opportunity to make them happy.  My wife puts off doing laundry because she probably does not enjoy folding it. (I mean who does, but you know what I mean here.)  The cleaned/dried laundry will pile up for several days to the point that we need to run it through the dryer again just to get the wrinkles back out from sitting in a wad.  She's otherwise a very hard worker and does things around the house most men wouldn't, works on her own car, etc.  I've offered to help her simultaneously with the folding, but that still ends up getting pushed back sometimes until she's ready.  When I do it myself, even just the folding, which let's be honest, is the most time-consuming part of the whole ordeal, she really appreciates that and makes sure to say thank you.  It's no big deal to me, I'm not as good at it as she is, but I'm getting there from practice, and I now realize it's a big deal to her.  So look for the things they put off doing, and pitch in if you can!
