YSK How to atone for your AH "joke"

content:
YSK: there is a right way and a wrong way to explain yourself if you make a joke that crosses the line.

My sense of humor leans heavily on bone-dry deadpan sarcasm - which means sometimes people can't tell when I'm joking. This can land me in "accidental asshole" territory if I say something unintentionally hurtful. 

WHY YSK: Defensively stating "I was just joking/I wasn't serious/that was obviously a joke" is a diversionary non-apology. This is a form of gaslighting and only makes you a bigger asshole 

How to own your mistakes and make amends:
"My intentions weren't to hurt X (person/group), and I am sorry." Period. Full stop. No buts.
"I hear that it wasn't funny, I acknowledge that it was hurtful, and I won't joke about that again."
Add "Thank you for pointing that out to me" and bam! - no longer the asshole.
