LPT: Taking a cooler on a long trip? Instead of ice cubes or refreezable packs, freeze a case of water bottles and pack them around your food. As they melt, you'll have fresh cold drinking water.

content:
This keeps your food drier since you won't have ice melting into a pool of water, and you're not wasting space with ice packs that you can't eat or drink. If you'll be staying somewhere with a freezer during your trip, save the bottles to refill and refreeze.
