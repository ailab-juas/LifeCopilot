LPT: If you can't kill a mosquito inside because it escapes your slaps, use a windows spray like Windex. It won't stain your walls, you can shoot at a distance with a mist that has a big range of effect and the mosquito will fall right down to the ground.

The sprays work because the animal doesn't realize it's being attacked up untill it's already incapacitated and unable to fly. I've used deodorants before but windows spray works much better.
