LPT: When explaining to your SO why you're upset, follow this general structure: "When you did X, it made me feel Y, because Z. What I need is W" and be specific!

This structure allows for a very beneficial dialogue to open up, and can dramatically reduce the probability of arguments.  In relationships communication skills are key, and so is respecting your partner. You should never point the finger and say "You disrespected me!" or "You weren't listening!", as this will almost always cause your SO to feel attacked and get defensive, and the conversation will go south quickly.

Instead, talk about how you felt when it happened. BE SPECIFIC!  "When we were with our friends and you complained about how I never do X at home, it made me feel disrespected" or "When I was trying to tell you about my day and you kept looking at your phone, I felt like you weren't listening to me"

Follow this up with why it made you feel that way, and what you would need in order to help in the future.  "I felt disrespected because I feel those things shouldn't be complained about in public. It would help if you would wait until were in a private setting to say something." or "I felt you weren't listening because all I heard was "uh huh" and "mhmm" while not making eye contact. It would help if I got some sort of validation that you're actually invested in the conversation."

My wife and I both do this and we have found that this type of method works wonders when it comes to not only getting to the root of a problem, but solving it.  I felt like I should share as it may be helpful for others too.
