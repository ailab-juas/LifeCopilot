YSK: Getting married does not cure a person of jealousy or insecurity

content:
Why YSK:  If you are in a relationship with a person who is jealous and/or insecure about your faithfulness, and this person does things like searching through your phone or constantly asks you who you're with &amp; what you're doing, and etc., then marrying that person is not going to suddenly cause that person to no longer be jealous and/or insecure about you and the relationship.

You might think that marriage, which is, in theory at least, the ultimate act to show commitment to another person would cause the insecure lover to no longer be insecure. After all, you have performed a ceremony that means "I'm faithful to you until death do us part. " But in reality that ceremony alone is not going to change a jealous/untrusting person into a more trusting person.

Here's my friendly, non-professional advice. You need to address your partner's insecurities head on. You can talk to you partner about the issue. You can suggest and attend couples therapy to see if your partner's issues can be resolved. After all, a lot of factors can cause a person to be insecure and a professional actually can help. But, if your partner's behavior and lack of trust in you is a problem for you, and nothing seems to fix it, then do not marry that person because marriage alone does not fix a jealous/insecure person and  the behavior is probably only going to get worse as time goes on
