LPT: When someone is going through a difficult time and is sharing it with you, don't talk about similar problems you're having as a way to relate. Instead, just listen.

When someone's sharing something difficult that they're going through, so many people get this urge to "empathize" by replying with similar struggles of their own. This is one of the worst things you can do when someone is trying to get something off their chest to you.

Instead of talking about yourself, just listen to them. Make them feel heard. Ask questions and help them work through it themselves. More often than we realize, people just to need to feel validated and heard when they're going through something personally difficult.

Years ago, I suffered a great loss, and turned to one of my friends for emotional support. His immediate response was, "Oh man, I'm really sorry to hear that. Because *I* remember when *I* had a similar loss, it was really rough for *me*. And what *I* felt was... etc." My friend wasn't trying to be insensitive or rude, but it reminded me that many people accidentally do this when dealing with someone else's grief.

I felt that my problem that I was trying to convey to my friend was lost on him, and I really just felt worse afterwards. But if he listened to me and made me feel heard, as another one of my friends did later on, I would've felt much better. Remember this if a friend or loved one ever reaches out to you to hear something they're going through.
