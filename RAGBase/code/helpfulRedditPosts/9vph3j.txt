YSK: You can get naloxone (Narcan), the drug of choice for opioid overdose, at CVS without a written prescription and it’s usually covered by insurance.

content:
With so many deaths from opioids in the US, I think it’s important for people to know, especially those who know someone who struggles with opioid addictions, that you can get a lifesaving drug without a prescription. Most states have laws protecting you from getting in trouble with police for owning/possessing Narcan, which is a really safe drug with few side effects, so it’s essentially risk free and it could potentially save somebody’s life.

edit: i saw some people asking about signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose, so here’s some good info from the CDC about it.
