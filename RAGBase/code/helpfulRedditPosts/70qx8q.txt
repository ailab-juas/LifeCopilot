YSK: you can sync your college canvas/blackboard calendar with your google calendar

content:
 I use canvas and I hate making an event everytime a teacher puts a new assignment. If a teacher puts it on the canvas calendar you can copy the ICAL link that it gives and paste it into your Google calendar. Now every time a teacher puts something up on the calendar. it's automatically in your Google calendar. I believe it works on blackboard too, but someone can verify. 


Edit: /u/jjgonya has instructions for canvas and blackboard check his comment out. Also, you can only add the ICAL to Google calendar on desktop.
