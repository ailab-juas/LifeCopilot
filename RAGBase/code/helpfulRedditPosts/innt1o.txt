YSK as a parent, sometimes your kid isn’t staying in there room all day simply because they are “lazy”. Sometimes, your kid is going through a tough time mentally, and it’s really hard for them to get themselves up and going.

Why YSK: As a teen with really bad anxiety, it’s really hard some days to get myself out of bed. As a parents, calling your kid lazy, unproductive, etc is not helping them and is driving that mental struggle even longer. Before you decide to say something about the way they are acting, ask if they are okay. Ask them if they have anything to get off there chest, and just ask how they are doing mentally. I promise you, you begin doing this and your kid will begin opening themselves up to you and will be able to over come any mental health struggle knowing you are on there side. 

I hope this tip helps with any new or old fathers and mothers:)
