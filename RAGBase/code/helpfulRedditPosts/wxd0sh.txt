title:
YSK that Wiktionary is by far the best slang dictionary on the internet

content:
Are the kids speaking a foreign language? Look up their slang (or any other word or phrase) in Wiktionary, the lesser-known sister project of Wikipedia. Despite the fact that all definitions are community-written, the quality is much higher than sites like Urban Dictionary, which have virtually no moderation. Here are some words that you might be wondering about:

[bussin'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bussin')

[gigachad](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gigachad)

[mald](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mald)

[goated](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/goated)

[ok boomer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/OK,_boomer)

[floccinaucinihilipilification](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/floccinaucinihilipilification)

Why YSK: Use this resource and take your kids' embarassment to the next level.
