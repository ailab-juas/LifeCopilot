YSK: if you are planning to add more flammable liquid to a fire, DO NOT pour it from a bottle

Why YSK: if you pour a flammable liquid such as lighter fluid, alcohol, or gasoline onto a fire, the flame is able to follow the fumes from the fire all the way up to the bottle causing an explosion. This will lead to a bigger fire and injury.
