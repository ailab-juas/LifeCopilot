LPT: Brush your tongue every day if you wish to avoid having bad breath. If your tongue is white, it's probably due to a build-up of smelly bacteria. Remember, few people are aware of their own bad breath!

content:
It's remarkable how many young and otherwise attractive people have toilet-breath. They probably brush their teeth on a regular basis and maybe even floss consistently, but without tongue-brushing, bad breath is inevitable.

It can take weeks of brushing to fully remove all of the crud and restore the tongue to its natural pink colour, so be patient.

Edit: There are several other causes of bad breath, including tonsil stones, acid reflux, and tooth decay, but tongue bacteria (or fungus) is one of the major causes, and definitely the easiest to cure.

Edit2: 'Tongue-scrapers' have worked very well for many people, and may cause less gagging than brushing, but brushing by itself has worked for me. If you have gagging issues, start at the front and work your way back day-by-day as you become less sensitive. Also, try clenching your non-brushing thumb in its hand, as that can help suppress the gag-reflex.
