title:
YSK: Bleach expires and becomes almost useless

content:
Why YSK: Bleach degrades over time into its constituent parts. It doesn't become more dangerous but it will absolutely lose its potency, thus limiting it's cleaning capabilities. If you're having a hard time getting bleach to work as you'd expect, think back to how long ago you bought it, as it could be almost completely inert if it's a few years old.
