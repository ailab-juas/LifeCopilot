LPT: If you don't get promoted at work and feel stuck, before thinking about leaving the place, try lateral movement.

AMENDMENT:
-Due to some discrepancies observed regarding the perception of the term lateral movement, I did some research and found that in fact, there are different types, I'm sorry for the confusion, as I only knew about one and never bothered to look deeper into it.


CAREER LATERAL MOVEMENT

-Different job

-Different department

-Same job, different company


This post was created to discuss about:

 -Lateral job rotation: specifically the one in which you can keep your original job, same boss, but are allowed to move across the company for short or prolonged intervals, or even just providing support for a few hours every day, while maintaining your original job, or doing overtime in another department. 


This type of lateral movement provides the advantages of learning new skills, getting a bigger perception of the company, flexibility, reduces boredom, expand your network, and the most important is that helps to assess person-job fit, providing the opportunity of a permanent transfer to another job and increasing the chances of a promotion, sometimes that permanent transfer includes a promotion. And frequently, also gives the worker access to information regarding higher roles, which can be used to obtain delegations from your boss. Creation or participation in non related projects, as long as you can prove your capabilities.


Of course, this system has some disadvantages
-Inefficiencies: if someone moves a lot, never achieve  mastery in any process. Solution: the movements are limited as they need to be authorized.

-Misunderstanding: some roles are similar but they have some small differences. Solution (mentoring programs and documented SOP's

-Some people do not like to be rotated, but sre usually very good and are considered as fit for the job.

-Lack of opportunity: people does not get promoted, only rotated. Solution: eventually they find a person-fit for a job, sometimes one promotion involves multiple positions, if they're related)

-Depending of the company rotations can be chosen by the worker, but preserving the original job.


So, my metaphors are about the workers who doesn't move from one job, limitating their  opportunities.


_____________________________________________



A lot of people believe that if they get their job done, arrives early and do plenty of overtime, their bosses eventually are going to notice their commitment and strong work ethic. 

After years of hard work, the only thing they get it's a pat on the back followed by a "good job". In the meantime, some guy with less than a year of getting hired, gets promoted. The first thought is that he probably has contacts at the top of the ladder. But think twice. 

A career is not a ladder to climb, it's a mountain, and moving up isn't always your best option, if you face a wall, move around to find a better place to climb, and sure, some people are born very high in the mountain, provided with oxygen tanks and climbing equipment. Also, some jobs are like caves, where you will only get the comfort of a shelter, and for some people, that's fine, and good for them.

But enough with the metaphors. If your job allows you to learn new tasks, or help with other departments, go for it, expand your skillset and build your network. Instead of doing overtime performing the same old work, use that time for innovation and get deeper into the process, even if it goes beyond your responsibilities, eventually your boss will delegate that process to you, and you can keep moving around. 

In summary, get the job done, do your time, but keep moving around, go beyond your responsibilities, and take the time to make new acquaintances,
