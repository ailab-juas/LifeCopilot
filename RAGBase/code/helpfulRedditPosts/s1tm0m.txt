YSK with all accounts now being online (bank and insurance) there’s no paper trial for you loved ones to follow incase you pass away.

content:
If all your accounts are online and password protected and you have no will (or the will is buried under ten-hundred thousand papers) your heirs aren’t going to know anything existed for them unless you tell them, especially in a time of unorganized chaos. Your heirs are also not going to know which attorney you’ve e filed your will with or about the safety deposit box (and key) unless you tell them. I’m going through this with a friend right now, the planning part not the death and this is why YSK to tell your heir where “what” is.
