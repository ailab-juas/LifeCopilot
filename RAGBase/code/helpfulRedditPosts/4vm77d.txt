LPT: When adopting a shelter dog, don't adopt a dog just because you fell in love with it. Adopt a dog that will be a good fit in your home and with your lifestyle.

Shelter animal adoption counselor here.  When adopting a dog, please give careful consideration to the home you live in, your lifestyle (e.g., very active, slower-paced, etc.), whether or not there are children in the family and look for a dog that will fit into your environment.  Never try to force a fit simply because you love the dog.  Too many dogs are returned because the adopter fell in love with a specific dog but the dog isn't a good match them.  It can cause problems for everyone, the dog gets returned and it isn't good for them emotionally.  They start to show signs of depression and it can crush their spirit.  So choose with both your head and your heart, not just your heart.  You'll be happier and your dog will thrive.  Thank you for giving a shelter pet a home.
