title:
LPT: If your house is flooding and you need to flee to the attic, bring an axe with you.

content:
This is so you can break through to get on top of the roof, so rescue teams can find you. If you get trapped in the attic, you could be stuck for days without food or water. Or, keep an axe in your attic.

This advice has been given by the authorities in areas affected by Hurricane Harvey, but it's an important LPT to keep in mind if you're ever affected.
