They will use tactics such as the REID method and others to undermine your credibility. 
Don’t worry that asking for a lawyer will make you seem guilty because it’s your right to do so and you should exercise that right EVERY TIME.  Many innocent people have been charged with crimes because they failed to invoke their right to legal council during questioning and interrogators have used this to their advantage.

EDIT: Explanation of the REID Technique.
The Reid Technique is an interview and interrogation method used by police officers and investigators. It consists of three elements, with the last one having nine questionable components. The Reid Technique is a manipulative and deceptive tactic that can coerce suspects into making false confessions. It uses open ended questions, lies, and leading questions to illicit answers that can be used against someone.
