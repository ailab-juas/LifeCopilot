YSK: If you ever want to get the pronunciation right when learning languages, singing along to songs in that language will help you a lot!

Why YSK: So when I was learning a new language, I had a really hard time with the pronunciation and accent but I discovered that singing along to songs helped me so freaking much! You automatically just start singing the song as the singer does and that will help you get your pronunciation right. It will help you get fluent and it's also a fun way to learn x

I really hope this helps someone like it helped me :))
