YSK: person X and I isn't always correct. Removing person X or yourself from the sentences makes it much easier to determine, me vs I, she vs her, etc. Many examples inside.

As some who reads a lot of student papers for my job this is a fairly difficult concept.  My English is not very good, but this one concept was difficult for me, and not a lot of people know this secret.


My father and me / I went to the store.

Remove father from the sentence. 


Me went to the store?! No, I went to the store.



My mother bought a wonderfult gift for my brother and I / me.

My mother bought a gift for I?! No, my mother bought a gift for me. 


She and me went to the store? Her and I went to the store?

Remove both! 

Her went to the store? No, she went to the store.  Me went to the store? No, I went to the store.

So 

She and I went to the store.
