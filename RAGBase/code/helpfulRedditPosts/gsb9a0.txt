LPT: Beware of people who never sincerely apologize.

content:
If you are close to someone who you have never once heard say "sorry"  and mean it, odds are they are a narcissist. They cannot admit when  they're wrong about something, or have done something wrong. At best  they'll just ignore it and hope it goes away. At worst they'll double  down on bad behavior when called out on it. Eventually this might very  well lead to them hurting you. This is very toxic behavior as they put  their personal pride above what is the right thing to do, and above the  feelings of those around them. I'm not saying you should cut off ties  with them immediately, or even at all, but don't let them sacrifice your  emotional well-being for theirs. Be aware, be ready to stand up for  yourself, and be ready to cut ties if they are determined to keep  walking that path.
