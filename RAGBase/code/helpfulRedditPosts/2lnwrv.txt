LPT: Count with your hands using binary instead of decimal and you can count up to 31 using one hand and 1023 using two!

Edit: Unary not decimal, sorry. Thanks assjuice666!

Starting with one hand (palm up), assign the following values to each finger:

* Thumb: 1
* Index: 2
* Middle: 4
* Ring: 8
* Little: 16


When the finger is extended, it has the value above and when it is curled up it has the value zero. E.g. zero is all fingers curled up; 5 is represented by an extended middle and thumb, the number 27 is an extended little, ring, index and thumb and 31 is all fingers extended.

Counting up to 16 would go:

1. thumb
1. index
1. thumb, index
1. middle
1. middle, thumb
1. middle, index
1. middle, index, thumb
1. ring
1. ring, thumb
1. ring, index
1. ring, index, thumb
1. ring, middle
1. ring, middle, thumb
1. ring, middle, index
1. ring, middle, index, thumb
1. little

Adding a second hand, assign the extra values on the second hand in reverse order. Starting with your right hand:

* Right thumb: 1
* Right index: 2
* Right middle: 4
* Right ring: 8
* Right little: 16
* Left little: 32
* Left ring: 64
* Left middle: 128
* Left index: 256
* Left thumb: 512


It takes a little practice at first, but it comes in really handy (at least with one hand).
