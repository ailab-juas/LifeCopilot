title:
LPT: Delete or empty your inactive PayPal accounts, since they started charging "inactive account service fee"

content:
I  do not want to comment on how I feel about that, but important thing is  that if your account is empty they will not take your money from the credit card, only if  you have some balance left.

*The  fee wonâ€™t be applied to those who have a zero  balance, where there is a  credit or debit card linked to the account.  PayPal says will only take  the fee from the balance and not from a  linked card or a bank account.*
