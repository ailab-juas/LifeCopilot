title:
YSK the US Postal Service has a service called informed delivery that will show you scans of the pieces of mail that are arriving that day

content:
Why YSK: This is a good service for people who receive checks or other important mail in their mailbox. This will help someone know if a piece of mail was stolen or possibly not delivered. Its also a good way to check to see if it is worth it to get off the couch and go check the mailbox.
Edit:  someone in the comments said I should mention it is a free service.
