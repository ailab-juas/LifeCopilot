LPT: slow cookers and curry powder are a godsend if you are busy or lazy, especially as a student/WFH.

I've got ADHD, so I often forget to cook and eat (or just don't have the gumption). Slow cookers are an absolute godsend.

All you have to do is chop up random veggies, chuck in any form of meat, water, and then dump in a bunch of curry powder. Tastes pretty good, and you have SOME food whenever you want it if you leave it on warm (not recommended to do for too long). The ingredients can be the suspect carrots that look nearly off, or whatever's left over from before. Meals are cheap as shit, if you skip the meat and just add beans it can be like $4. Curry powder adds flavour to anything. Can make sure you're getting a balanced diet very easily. Cooks while out doing other stuff, sleeping or at work. Max 10 minutes of "cooking", even if you leave it on it's a low fire risk.
