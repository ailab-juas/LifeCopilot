LPT: Have a mosquito problem around your house? Get a bird feeder.

content:
No matter how much bug repellents you use, a bird feeder will by FAR be the best solution. You will keep your land chemical free and provide great scenary when you want to eat outside. Setting one up during spring time can cultivate a large population of birds near your area which will significantly cut down on bug problems.
