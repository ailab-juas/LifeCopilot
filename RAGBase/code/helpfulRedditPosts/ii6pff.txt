LPT : Get yourself a safety razor, save $$ and save environment

content:
I overlooked safety razors for 15 years thinking it to be a vintage tool. Recently delved into double edged safety razors for the first time and I am fully in love with it. They provide clean shave and to me it gives a lot better shave than premium cartridge type razors. Since you just need to change the metal blade, which is almost fully recyclable, you are saving the environment too. Safety razors are damn cheap. In my country Gillette Fusion Razors cost 200 times the price of safety razor blades.

Get yourself a safety razor, save the planet and save some $!
