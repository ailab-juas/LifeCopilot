LPT (Request): It's getting darker again, what can I do against a winter depression?

content:
I notice I'm already a bit more down than usual..

I heard I should take vitamin D, as well as a walk during daylight. Brighter rooms might work as well. Any other tips?

edit:
Skiing is not an option here (the Netherlands), no mountains ;) I'll start taking vitamins, and do some walking during lunch break.

To summarize the useful tips below:

* Take Vitamin D supplements
* Take walks during the day
* Exercise
* Stay warm
* Use special SAD-lighting or do light therapy
* Move to a warm country
* Go on vacation
* Go ski or snowboard
* Wake up early
* Stay active: if you're bored, search some new hobbies.
* Smoke weed (I'd advise against that myself; I dunno if that will help, I just don't do drugs, although it is legal here)
* Sex

I'm not really feeling depressed myself, just a bit less happy. If you are feeling depressed, go see a doctor!
