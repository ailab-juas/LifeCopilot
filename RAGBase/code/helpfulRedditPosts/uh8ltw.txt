LPT: Please, please remember to cut the vent strings on your new suit jackets.

content:
They're the little strings that connect the suit tail(s) to the sides of your jacket so the jacket lies flat and looks clean in the store.

I've seen so many engagement and wedding photos (or just people out in public) where the strings haven't been cut and it causes the suit jacket to be all bunched up and look awkward.

If you're a groomsmen or in any other position where you might notice something like this, let the new-suit-wearer know â€“ they'll appreciate it.

Second edit: While we're at it, also know that the labels/tags loosely sewn on the sleeve near the cuff and loose strings keeping the chest/breast pocket closed are also meant to be removed. In addition, long jackets/trenchcoats also frequently have vent strings, which should also be removed prior to wearing.
