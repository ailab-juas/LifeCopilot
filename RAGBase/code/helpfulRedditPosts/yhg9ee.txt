LPT: If you want to help the environment, look for recycled packaging before recyclable packaging

content:
1. It's been recycled at least once, which that recyclable packaging probably won't be.

2. It helps create demand for recycled packaging, which makes recycling more economical and may lead to more recycling in the future.

Disclaimer: this won't save the world but one is better than the other.
