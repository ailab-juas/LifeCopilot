LPT: Never give out any personal information on an inbound call

content:
I just received a call today from the "National Student Loan Services of Canada" (I have a student loan). Turns out it was a scam caller. 

If it is an important call, and personal information is required, tell them that you will call their service back after googling their proper phone number; don't call them back on a number that they give you. 

Even if it's a legitimate call, it's better to be safe. 

Edit: Yes, the National Student Loan Services of Canada is real; the caller was pretending to be them.
