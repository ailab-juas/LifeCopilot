LPT: If you want to get into/get some insight into a new hobby or job, start following meme accounts for that specific thing. You’ll most likely see inside jokes about what to avoid/what most of them recommend, and you’ll also get reminded to pursue it whenever it comes up in your feed.

When I was learning programming I started following programming accounts on Instagram, and I learned surprisingly much just from seeing the memes everyday. 
I do this to almost anything I’m interested in. If there’s a hobby like running which you might not be really hyped to pursue, meme accounts will help remind you in a fun way and motivate you. 

From a psychological standpoint I think it might have to do with us wanting to relate and fit in with “the pack”. When we see a group of people having inside jokes about something we don’t know about, we automatically want to learn more. Gl with your hobbies and careers! &amp;lt;3


Edit: Thank you for all the positive feedback and the awards! I’ve seen a lot of comments mentioning the programming subreddits though, as a proof this tip is bad. Do know that not all meme pages/subreddits will be as accurate/good, and this is just a general tip. 
I used Instagram programming accounts as an example, I never recommend or said the subreddit for programming was good. I would advise you all to avoid whatever meme pages makes your life harder and stick to the motivating/fun ones. This tip might work on some, but not all of course. :)
