LPT: return those cheap metal or plastic hangers you get from the dry cleaner back to the dry cleaner instead of throwing them away. They can reuse them, and you’ll save some trash!

EDIT: yes, keep any you want to use to hang your own clothes, I’m talking about extras that you don’t want. 

EDIT 2: no, I am not a dry cleaner.
