LPT: If something bad happens in your life, don't let it define who you are. Don't make it your excuse for not progressing yourself. Don't undermine it, learn from it, understand it, and let it be apart of you without it being who you are.

Edit: I just want to say thank you to everyone who got something from this. That's all I wanted and I'm glad I could help a few people out today. :)
