YSK what to do when you receive other people's mail.

content:
I work in the leasing office for an apartment community and I deal with this much more often than I should. Save yourself and your leasing agent some time by following this one weird trick.

If you're currently living in an apartment or a rental home, you're probably still getting mail intended for a previous resident.  When you receive this mail, write "RTS - Not at this address" (RTS = return to sender) on the envelope and drop it in the outgoing mail slot.  It takes a few weeks of dedication, but after that, your mailbox will be filled with only *your* mail.
