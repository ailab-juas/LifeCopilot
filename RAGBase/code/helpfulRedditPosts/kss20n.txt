LPT: Leaving an abusive spouse? Narcissistic Parents? Before saying anything, find important documents like your birth certificate, passport etc...

content:
Thinking about leaving your spouse/partner, or leaving the home of abusive parents? Try your best to get your hands on important personal documents like your birth certificate, passport, social security card etc... it can be very difficult to get replacements.

These documents can be targeted, they can also open the door to "having to go back" for them. Don't let anyone hold you hostage.
