YSK you can keep the dishwasher repairman away by using MAX 1 TBSP of powdered dishwasher soap.

Source -- dishwasher repairman with MANY years of experience: Single greatest cause of dishwasher repairs is using too much soap. The excess soap damages the seals and interior components. Use 1 TBSP powdered soap in the dispenser and liquid rinse aid.
Don't use the pills or the liquid, just powder with separate rinse aid. There will be NO less cleaning, dishes won't be dirtier. I have owned the same dishwasher for 18 years; 2 repairs.

Edit/update: I have begun to pay attention in every store I go to and clearly, powdered dishwasher detergent is harder to come by than it used to be. Likely, this is a combination of supply chain difficulties and manufacturersâ€™ desire to sell the pods, which ensure that you buy and use the amount of chemicals the company wants you to use every time you use the dishwasher.

Why YSK: using 1 TBSP powdered dishwasher soap makes your dishwasher last longer with fewer repairs.
