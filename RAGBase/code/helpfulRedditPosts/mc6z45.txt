LPT: Take pictures and videos of your pets doing regular, boring things too.

content:
After losing my first kitty of 16 years, I found myself missing the mundane things like snuggling in the morning, watching her look at the birds or taking a nap on the counter. Even just sitting on the floor looking up at me. Most of the pictures and videos I had of her were doing the "once in a blue moon cute" things that were social media worthy. The few "boring" pics and vids I have of her are sometimes more comforting and I wish I had more. Just to remember what day to day life was like with her. 

I think we get caught up in the "what can I share with the world" mindset, especially when we compare our animals' pics to those on r/aww or videos from The Dodo.  This makes us think a picture of our cat laying on the couch doing nothing isn't "worthy" of sharing or keeping in our camera roll, when in reality they can be the most valuable, especially when greiving. 

The same applies to people as well. Take lots of pictures and videos. And save even the stupid, imperfect, and boring ones too.
