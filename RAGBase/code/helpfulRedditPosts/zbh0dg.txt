title:
YSK that you can opt in for texts about charges from cc companies

content:
All the major credit cards (banks, too) can send you text notifications which you will receive the instant a charge hits. Enabling such notifications goes a very long way in preventing fraudulent charges from being missed. 

Why YSK: To avoid being a victim of theft via scams that claim your card didn’t work so a cash payment is necessary. If you get an immediate text that the payment went through, you won’t pay twice. (Unlike someone I know. Who double paid the same establishment. Three separate times.)
