LPT: If you know or suspect that you are going to be leaving a job soon, request a "vacation refill" from your pharmacy for all of your medications.

content:
They are hardly ever questioned, never mind refused, and can give you a  lot of flexibility even if you're moving to a new job right away.

ETA: Be more cautious about requesting an additional refill for narcotics, or other controlled substances.

ETA2: This tip is for places like the US where your health insurance is often tied to your employer.

ETA3: I'm gratified by the positive responses, but I'm not even going to try to respond to all the comments, there are too many. Several have mentioned being in a situation where they need meds but can't afford them. Many commenters have mentioned these two sites: 

[https://www.goodrx.com/](https://www.goodrx.com/)

[https://costplusdrugs.com/](https://costplusdrugs.com/)

I can't vouch for either, but enough people mentioned them that I thought I would add them here in case it's useful for someone.
