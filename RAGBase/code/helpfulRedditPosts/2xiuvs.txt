LPT: Every time you accomplish something, make a note of it on an "Accomplishments List." When you're feeling sad, just look back at all the awesome stuff you've done!

content:
Not only is it personally encouraging, but it also comes in handy for recall. It definitely helps, both as a motivator and a memory tool. 

Edit: Went to sleep, and wow did this blow up. In response to the negative comments, allow me to explain my reasoning: in no way is the idea of the list meant to fuel narcissism or self-importance. I'm just a high school student, so maybe I'm in no position to be speaking, but I've found that in the past, a good way of keeping myself on track is to jot down things that I've finished. For example:

* Earned industry certification in Photoshop 
* Completed the 2015 yearbook without killing my staff 
* Created 200 pieces of original design work

Now, I know these examples may not be very impressive. But for me, they represent hours of hard work and dedication. They give me faith in my self-efficacy. 

These "victories," of course, will vary from person to person. But the concept remains the same: all you're doing is making a list of concrete accomplishments. Things into which you've put effort, and seen a return. On days when you're feeling lazy or unproductive, it may serve as inspiration. Like, *hey, wow, look at these things I've done. But this is all old news. What can I tackle NOW?* 

I'm sorry if some of you don't feel that this is a true LPT. Because I do. I mean, it's not like a little list is going to solve all your woes and restore hope to shattered souls everywhere - but it's a small way to keep your spirits up. To help yourself feel a bit happier and a bit more confident. I think that's worth something, even if this post is getting some backlash.
