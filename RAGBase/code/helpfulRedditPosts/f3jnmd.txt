title:
YSK that if you get arrested, your best bet is to say absolutely nothing.

content:
When you get arrested the cop has to now build a case against you and you’d make their job a lot harder by not saying anything. Trying to justify or lie will make it easier for cops to find additional information to eventually convict you and a lawyer will have an easier time defending someone who didn’t interfere with whatever defense they have for you. Just play dumb. 

Learned it the hard way a few years ago so you don’t have to.

EDIT: Just two disclaimers: 
- I’m in Canada and can’t speak much for how things are in America etc and the politics of it. 
- A lot are confusing being pulled over or question and actually arrested. If you are questioned, cooperate while not admitting to anything. If you are arrested, meaning taken into custody, then don’t speak.
