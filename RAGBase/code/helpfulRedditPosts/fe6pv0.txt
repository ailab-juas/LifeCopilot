YSK driving 65mph is 20% more energy efficient than driving 80mph

content:
One of the most effective things drivers can do to save on gas (and decrease carbon emissions) is to drive 65mph or less. 

This means driving 50 miles would take eight minutes longer.

If the US changed its national speed limit to 55mph, it would decrease our gas consumption by 1 billion barrels annually.

Edit: ok, to summarize the replies: this doesn’t hold true for all cars, driving slow may have a negative impact on the flow of traffic, your time is more precious than your money. Time to buy a Tesla!

Edit 2: don’t believe me. There’s a [gas cost calculator](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.jsp) where you plug in the year, make and model of your car. It provides the average cost when driving at different speeds.
