LPT: how do you deal with work burnout and stress?

content:
I feel like our late 20s and early 30s are the busiest in our lives. I work full time and I feel like I have no time to do anything. I’m already exhausted from working full time, cooking, cleaning, scheduling and going to medical/dental appointments.. trying to get enough sleep, drink enough water and exercise. HOW DO PEOPLE DO THIS? I can’t imagine having time to date or have children on top of all this. I want to be with someone and eventually have kids, but then I fear that I have no time for myself.  What are your advice on adulting and managing stress?
