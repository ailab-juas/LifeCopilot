LPT: Get rid of armpit stains in shirts using hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and a dab of dish soap.

content:
Mix the three ingredients into a paste and work it into stains with a small brush (old toothbrush or a nail brush), let it sit for a few and throw it in the laundry as usual. 

This has worked on white shirts and colored shirts for me, even got other stains out that nothing else worked on.

(I haven't tried it with the white stains on black shirts yet but if someone would like to give it a shot on an old one I'd like to hear the result)
