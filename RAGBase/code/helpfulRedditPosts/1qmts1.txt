LPT: Undoubtedly many of you are donating to charities in response to Typhoon Haiyan. Consider researching your charity of choice before donating for maximum effectiveness.

content:
I like to find a charity with a high percentage of program expenses which is basically the percent of the charityâ€™s budget spent on the programs and services it exists to deliver (Money going to the cause after the charity takes their "cut")

some of the big charities are paying their CEO's 500k a year and that can be roughly 2% of your donation and after that and other expenses you can end up seeing 80% of the money making it where it is supposed to go. 

I like charities that have 90+% program expenses 

There are also many other things to consider when selecting a charity, Pick something you care about, Consider if it is local or global. Also how diverse is their revenue stream? How big is their deficit?

You can research on this website.

EDIT#2 From /u/cdc482 who sent me a message regarding this post:

&gt; The nitty gritty of why these are the best charities (Click Top Charities, read the reports) http://www.givewell.org Their about page also makes good points about why you should trust their methods of evaluation
&gt; 
&gt; This guy makes a great case for shopping around and picking the best charities (it's very dumbed down and slow moving) http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html
&gt; 
&gt; This guy is a scumbag, but makes good points as to why you should stay away from traditional charity evaluation methods (Charity Navigator and the BBB) and focus more on effectiveness http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong.html
&gt; 
&gt; Freakonomics did a pretty good episode on ranking charities. Can't find the audio, but here are a couple great summaries. http://freakonomics.com/2011/06/09/why-ranking-charities-by-administrative-expenses-is-a-bad-idea/ http://freakonomics.com/2011/11/29/bargain-hunting-for-charities/
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a good page that would probably be just as good for people who are willing to do research on their own. http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/19/6-tips-for-giving-like-a-pro/
&gt; 
&gt; Hope you don't get offended. There's just a great opportunity for good here! Shame for it to be wasted.
