YSK: to be careful about giving your information to Zillow

content:
I was recently looking at condos on Zillow.com as I live with my parents and plan on moving out sometime but I was just looking. I wanted to ask a question on a property and it makes you enter in all your contact info. A couple weeks later and even 6 months later I am being bombarded by sales calls for people wanting to by my house that I don’t have, to roofing companies wanting to roof my house to finance companies wanting me to refinance, etc I am getting at least 5 sales calls a day it’s non stop I’ve never had this problem before. Zilliow will will sell the shit out of your information.
