LPT:If you work for a large company or organization that uses Microsoft Office products, you might be able to get Office Pro for $10.00 dollars.

I just found out about this through a coworker, and apparently if you work for a company that has a large volume license, as an employee, you might have a perk in the form of being able to download office professional for only 10 dollars. Just go to the website and see if you are eligible. You have to use your company or organizations e-mail address and not your personal one.

A coworker told me about this after finding out that employees from our company were eligible. Bought it as soon as I got home!
