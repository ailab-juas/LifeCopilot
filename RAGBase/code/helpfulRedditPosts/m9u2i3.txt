LPT - When returning equipment take photographs and video of you sealing up box and when you bring it to UPS or FedEx store.

content:
About four months ago I canceled my Comcast/Xfinity service. I packed up their remotes, cable box etc and took photographs and video of process. 

I got an email saying equipment was partially returned and to please pay $90. I called and asked what was missing. They couldn't tell me. I asked again what was missing and they couldn't tell me but I still owed $90. 

I told them I had video and photographs and would call again in a week. I called two weeks later and they had closed my case and I no longer owed $90.
