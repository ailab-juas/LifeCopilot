You Should Also Know: [There are currently over 100,000 people in the US on the wait list to receive a kidney.](https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/organ-donation-and-transplantation-stats)

As an American with polycystic kidney disease, and with friends and family who also have PKD, I appreciate you taking the time to learn about this widespread issue. 

I don't need a transplant yet, but right now, about 100,791 others in the US alone survive on lifespan-shortening dialysis treatments while they sit on the wait list for a kidney transplant, often waiting for years. 

Anything you can do to offer assistance to families dealing with kidney disease, kidney failure and dialysis, and anything you can do to spread awareness of this issue will be immensely appreciated and might save some lives. 

Help me spread the world about the years-long kidney transplant wait list and the kidney donor shortage, and especially the fact that a blood type mismatch doesn't have to be a dead end for someone who wants to donate a kidney to a loved one, thanks to Paired Exchange Programs.

[What are the long term risks for kidney donors?](https://www.kidney.org/transplantation/livingdonors/long-term-risks)

An important and fascinating quote from the above link:

"When one kidney is removed, the single normal kidney will **increase in capacity to compensate.** This is called “compensatory growth.” Studies show that your total kidney function returns to roughly 70% within 10 to 11 days, and about **70 to 80%** at long term follow-up."
