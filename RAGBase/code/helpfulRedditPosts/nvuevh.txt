YSK: Just because you told the person at the drive thru to "hang on" doesnt mean they're not still listening

WHY YSK:
As a manager of a popular restaurant chain I cannot count the number of times people tell us they're not ready to order and then proceed to have VERY private conversations.

Some things to know:

We cannot turn the headset off once you've activated it

There are either speakers inside the building or at least 4 people wearing headsets at all times, so literally everyone hears what you're saying

The headsets (unless you're at an older place) are very sensitive, so that phone call? Yes we heard it too, also, side note, please quit screaming into them, a normal voice is fine

We absolutely discuss everything you say, and remember the truly awkward ones, we even have names for you.


In summation, be ready to order, dont scream, dont have conversations you dont want overheard, and repeated (often in a funny voice) and dont be rude

Have a great day.


For fun, my favorite so far is the guy we call Don Juan because he calls both his wife and girlfriend while sitting at the speaker and gets us to bag it seperately.
