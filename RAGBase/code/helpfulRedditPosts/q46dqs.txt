LPT: If you think you are getting "mixed signals" from someone, consider that they might just be telling you what you don't want to hear, but nicely.

content:
It doesn't matter whether this is morally wrong. The tip here is how to deal with feeling like you are getting mixed signals. If someone continually declines your invitations, doesn't respond to your texts for long periods, or tells you they want to do something else without you (including being in a relationship), no matter how nice they are about it, now much the flatter you, you really should take them at face value. Vague answers from potential employers also are included here.

Stepping away from a situation where you are getting mixed signals rarely turned out poorly. It gives the other person room to do things at their own pace (which might be not at all, in which case, there is your answer) and space for you to consider other options.
