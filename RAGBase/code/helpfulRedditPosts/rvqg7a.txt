LPT: If you want someone to stop staring at you without directly confronting them, turn to look behind you as if trying to see what they're staring at.

content:
I live in an Asian country where I tend to stand out. Sometimes I find people staring at me. Usually (if not always) it's out of curiosity, but sometimes I just don't want to be stared at.

Rather than directly asking them 'what's the matter' or similar, I act as if they're staring behind/through me. I turn to look behind me then back at them. It immediately makes them self-conscious and aware that they have been caught staring. I would say 9 times out of 10 they immediately stop. It's a pretty effective and polite way of drawing attention to their staring without having to directly confront them about it.
