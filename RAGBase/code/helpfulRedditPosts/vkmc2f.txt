YSK: Taking a video of your rental car when you pick it up may save you from false damage claims.

content:
**Why YSK:** So I picked up my rental. It was an SUV in a mountain town and had some scratches in typical places. The hatch area from people dragging their luggage out, scratches around the handles, deep scratches around the fenders and front end, likely from people talking it off-road.

I had been taking pictures of my rentals for years, and then videos of rentals ever since a rental company tried charging me for a windshield crack that was already there.

Anyway, they tried claiming I did the scratches on the front end and fenders. I told them I didn't, they didn't believe me. Started talking about how I needed to pay for the damage or they were going to charge my insurance, blah blah. I pulled out my phone and showed the video, and she gave up the fight right there. The look on her face was actually worth the hassle. 

This was with Avis, for anyone curious.
