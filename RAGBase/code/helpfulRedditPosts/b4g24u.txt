YSK almost every hotel will give you complimentary 1h late check-out, all you have to do is ask

content:
I travel a lot and have learned this from years of personal experience.

Call reception, ask if a late check-out is available and say even just an extra hour would be great.

Be polite, be respectful, and be appreciative when they say yes.

Absolute worst case they say no, but that's legitimately never happened to me.

Give it a crack!
