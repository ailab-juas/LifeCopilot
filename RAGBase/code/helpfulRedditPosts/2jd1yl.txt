From their YT description:

19 museums. 9 international research centers. 168 million artifacts. One channel. Infinite stories.

The Smithsonian Channel explores the history of our planet, life and culture, with 100% original, family-friendly programming. From the origins of the universe to the deaths of civilizations, from upscale design awards to down-home chili cook-offs, we tackle subjects as diverse and limitless as the landscape we cover.
