LPT: If you can't have a nice apartment, have a clean one

content:
A good deep clean will make a world of difference for any living space.  No one wants to take a shower in a bathroom with mold everywhere, or  cook in a kitchen with bits of old food in all the corners, or sit by a  smudged, dirty window. These things can sneak up on you if you're busy  or not a clean person by nature, like me. But fixing them will make your  whole space much more pleasant to be in.
