YSK Home Depot sells large boxes for less than $2 each. Don't waste money at Staples or Office Max

content:
Go to Home Depot and ask for moving boxes. There are many sizes and super cheap compared to a shipping box from a mailing place. Happy Holidays.


 FYI I don't work there or anything. I just googled shipping boxes and lucked out.
