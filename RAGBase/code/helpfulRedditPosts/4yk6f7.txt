LPT: There is a visible difference between not working out at all and doing 15 pushups every day. Make 15 push ups your new 'not working out'.

content:
If you do not work out, do 15 pushups every day. It does not sound like much but it makes a huge long term difference to not working out. It does not take long and it makes a visible difference. 
If you struggle with 15, do 10. If 15 make you smile do 20.

Edit: Because of people messaging/commenting about injury and muscle imbalance: This is not meant to replace your workout routine nor is it meant to be your goto routine for the next 5 years.  
The LPT is meant to be: Even a tiny workout can go a long way. Warm up. Mix it up. But don't think working out only works if you spend 3 days a week in the gym. There is a wide gap between not working out at all and doing 5-10 minutes every day. You can see that difference and you can feel it. Some say even a few dong chin ups every other day can go a long way ...
