YSK: if a rock comes off of a truck and damages your windshield, the truck driver will be held responsible for damages

content:
A lot of gravel trucks have decals that read “stay back 200ft” or “not responsible for damages” to deter people into thinking the company/driver isn’t liable for damages, but that isn’t true. Decals are not legally binding.

All drivers are responsible for securing their load. In the event that an unsecured load damages your vehicle, you should always take the driver’s license plate number.
