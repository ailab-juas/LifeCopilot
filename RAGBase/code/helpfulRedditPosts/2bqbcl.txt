LPT: You do NOT need to pay interest to build credit.

content:
The idea that you need to pay interest on anything in order to build credit is a myth. *This myth needs to die.* 

It is never a good idea to finance your purchases solely to build credit. The best way to build credit is to regularly use credit cards for your purchases, and then pay them off in full each month so you don't pay a cent in interest. 

DON'T PAY INTEREST TO BUILD YOUR CREDIT.
