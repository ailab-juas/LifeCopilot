LPT: Daylight Savings Time is ending soon; if you feed your pet on a schedule, start pushing it back a few minutes a day soon.

content:
Pets have no way to tell what time of day it is other than what nature tells them, and DST is a human construct.  If they get fed at 7am now, then they'll want to be fed at 6am on November 1st.  If you start pushing their feeding time back a little each day starting soon (the 20th would be perfect if you use 5 minute increments) then your pets won't be StArViNg! and deny you that blissful hour of sleeping in on November 1st.
