LPT: Using Excel at work? Learn to use named tables (Insert &gt; Table). It will simplify your formulas and your life

content:
Some benefits:

* Reference column names instead of range references ([Amount] instead of $B$2:$B28)
* Tables extend automatically when data is entered in the row beneath the bottom row. Formulas won't need to be updated! Same goes with columns added to the right. 
* Formulas entered in a blank column of a table automatically copy to the whole column, and extend/contract with the table
* Default design is banded rows (no need for conditional formatting, which always breaks)

You can convert any data range to a table by pressing Ctrl + T. 

I've introduced colleagues, and their minds are always just blown!
