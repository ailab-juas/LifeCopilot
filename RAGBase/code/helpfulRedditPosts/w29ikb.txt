YSK about gaff (gaffer's) tape. It's similar to duct tape but leaves no sticky residue. It is commonly used in film and audio industries for taping cables down, holding things together, or as labels for marking information.

Why YSK:  If you've ever used duct tape on carpet or to wrap/organize cables and then noticed a sticky residue upon removal, you're a good candidate for using gaff tape instead.  It's more expensive at about $0.40 (usd) per foot or $20 for a 2"x50' roll compared to about $0.05 per foot.  But if you are frustrated with sticky residues from tapes and can afford it, it's worth the lack of frustration.

I have had gaff tape on carpet in an apartment for an oche line (line from which darts are thrown) for 2 years.  When we moved and I peeled it up, there was zero residue.  I also use it for taping cables together or labeling boxes.  

I will not recommend specific retailers except to say that Amazon prices + shipping seems too high to me compared to other retailers.

Edit: math is hard

2nd Edit:  Many are pointing out a downside of gaff tape.  If it's in the sun or getting hot for long periods of time, it can leave residue and be a gooey mess.  It can also peel paint so be careful what you stick it to.  There are also numerous brands with some preferred more than others.
