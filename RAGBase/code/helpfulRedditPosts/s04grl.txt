LPT: Once you move out of your childhood home, try every style of food again!! Even the ones you think you hate

content:
Parents, family, and caregivers are a lot of things - but more often than not, they aren’t professional chefs. But in your youth, you can only form opinions based off what you experience. Growing up, I always assumed I was a “picky” eater. And would avoid tasting or trying new things, having had an ingredient or two I disliked in my childhood, and assuming I wouldn’t like the dish. 

In turns out, my mother just was a terrible cook. It wasn’t until I set out into the world and realized so many things are delicious! Don’t like vegetables? I didn’t either when they were slopped out of a can and put on my plate. But grilled and seasoned correctly? Absolutely delicious. 

If you feel you have a limited pallet and typically just stick to foods you know are “safe” PLEASE do yourself a favor and try them when prepared at a restaurant! Or even just watch YouTube videos on how to prepare them appropriately yourself. Odds are, you’re missing out on a world of delicious culinary offerings all because of a misconception formed in your youth. You more than likely don’t “hate” a certain type of food, you’ve just never experienced it cooked correctly. 

Bon appetit!
