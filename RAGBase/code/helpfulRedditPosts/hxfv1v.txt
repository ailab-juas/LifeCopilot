LPT: If you're going through a break up, cut off all communication with your ex and inform any mutual friends that you don't want to hear anything about her/him. This will create a stale redundancy in your mind and will help facilitate the process of moving on eventually.

Edit: Christ, this blew up. To clarify a few things - I in no way intend this advice to be applicable to everyone. If you're having trouble moving on though, maybe it's best to go no contact that being the case. 
Also, as far as an explanation for "stale redundancy" goes - I would define it as a state in which no new data is coming in, so your mind just recycles what it already knows to a point of redundancy until it loses interest. I would liken it to playing a video game over and over again after completing everything there is to do in it. Eventually you'll get bored and will want to do something else. New information about your ex (such as if she's dating again) would be akin to the developers releasing new DLC for the game. It's going to give you a reason to play/think about things.
