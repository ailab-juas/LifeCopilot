LPT: Stop the burning after throwing up by gargling baking soda dissolved in water

content:
Gastric acid, the acid secreted from your stomach, is HCl, or Hydrchloric acid. Baking soda's molecular formula is NaCHO3. This is a spontaneous reaction which occurs when they're mixed: NaHCO3(aq) + HCl(aq) --&gt; NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g) Baking soda, in solution, when mixed with Hydrochloric Acid, in solution, forms table salt, water, and carbon dioxide (the gas you breathe out).
This reaction will neutralize the acid in your throat (and mouth) and will stop the burning due to the acidity.

EDIT: Tums, or similar antacid tablets, are the same thing (as suggested by commenters).
