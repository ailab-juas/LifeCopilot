title:
YSK that a child’s body heat rises 3-5 times faster than adults, and can die in a hot vehicle within an hour.

content:
Its starting to warm up (at least here in the south). In 2018, 52 children died from being left in hot cars, mostly unintentionally. A vehicles temperature can rise to 125F within minutes of direct sunlight exposure on a warm day. 80% of this temperature increase can happen within the first 10 minutes, and children have died at temperatures as low as 60F. 

I plead to you to remind your friends, family, and loved ones with children to always check the car before they lock the doors. It never hurts to double check. 

If you see a child in a car by his/herself please call an emergency line for your location. 911, or whatever the numbers are in other countries. 
Here’s a link to some facts about kids and cars for anyone looking for more information.
