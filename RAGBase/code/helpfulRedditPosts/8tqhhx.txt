LPT: If you started college at a 2 year school, then transfer to a 4 year school and dropped out without a degree, contact the 2 year school about Reverse Transfer Programs, you may have already earned an Associates Degree that you are not getting credit for.

For more information, check out ReverseTransfer.org(https://reversetransfer.org/)

Also, if the 2 year college you attended is not listed on reversetransfer.org, that doesn't necessarily mean they cannot transfer your credits back, so contact them.
