LPT: When mentioning time on the Internet, use 'x hours ago' or 'y hours from now' instead of your local time zone

content:
It's 2014. reddit and many other websites have 'x hours ago' labels under posts and comments. Using this notation does not require tedious time zone conversion and saves a lot of headache for everybody.

----- EDIT -----

Obviously, we cannot use this for long periods of time unless you just go to a countdown website and set a timer (much better idea?). Okay, perhaps we can only use it for stuff on the Internet like live streams, Steam trades, video chats etc.

Examples:

"The SpaceX live stream will begin when this post is 15 hours old."  
"Link expires when this comment is 8 hours old."  
"TF2 tournament starts when this post is 5 hours old."  
On reddit: "EDIT (at 4 hours old): ooh frontpage! thanks guyz."

----- EDIT (at 15 hours old) -----

Actually, we should just use beats: http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/internettime
