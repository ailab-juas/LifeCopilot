YSK about "Problem Steps Recorder", a criminally underrated troubleshooting tool for Windows

content:
Problem Steps Recorder, or PSR.exe, is a great tool for end users and support analysts alike.

You can access it by typing psr.exe in your start search bar, or by going start -&gt; run and typing psr.exe

Its a tool that can record the steps you take to perform an action, or to demonstrate steps taken before an error is encountered.

After the recording is made, the program automatically creates an html file that displays what actions were taken, and what dialog messages are displayed.

If you run in to a problem at work, rather than sending a screenshot to your IT guys, you can just fire up psr, repeat the process, and send them the automatically created document. Your IT team will love you.

Alternatively, if you are an IT guy, you can use it to quickly create a document to teach your user how to do something.

Great bit of kit. You should try it.

-edit-

Forgot to mention this is a feature only in Windows 7 and up.
