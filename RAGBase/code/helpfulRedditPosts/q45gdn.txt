LPT: If you start a new job, and it’s slower or not what you expect, for the love of God, keep it to yourself and don’t tell your boss/temp agency/HR

content:
I started a new job that had an hour of work, and the rest was 7 hours of sitting around not doing anything.

2 weeks into my job, HR called me into the office for an update on how I felt about the job and I stupidly informed them it was kinda slow and my trainer was in meetings so he couldn’t provide directions on what needed to be done during slow times.

HR said they would look into it and get back to me.

They got back to me alright. At the end of the next day they called me in and said it wasn’t going to work out and they were letting me go.
