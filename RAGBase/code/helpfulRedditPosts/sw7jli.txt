LPT: If you become aware of a crime, you tell the police, not your boss, or your teacher, or the head of whatever organisation is involved.

content:
You could tell a boss, or a teacher etc *too*, but if you're aware of criminal wrongdoing, informing anyone but the police is a secondary concern.  Too often we see cases of abuse where well intentioned people trusted that it would be properly dealt with if they told a coach, or a boss, and then those people buried it.  Don't give them that option.  Go to the police *personally* and make sure you've reported it to *them*.  First, preferably.  The police may even tell you to tell no one.

edit: obviously I'm talking about crimes that actually need to be reported.  If you see someone pilfering money out of the pockets of a major corporation, you saw nothing.
