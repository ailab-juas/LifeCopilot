title:
LPT: you can stop a sneeze by slowing your breathing dramatically when you feel it coming on.

Edit: I realize most people hate the feeling and it might not be the best idea, but there are times it's necessary. My customers probably wouldn't appreciate being served a plate of food after I had just sneezed all around it

Edit 2: almost died when I sneezed while driving through this hurricane because I forgot my own LPT,  so there's another reason
