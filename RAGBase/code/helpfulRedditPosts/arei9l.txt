LPT: When you are moving houses, pack a week's of clothes and daily necessities in a separate bag. That way you'll have all you need for an entire week without having to spend hours unpacking giant boxes to find what you need on the first night.

Found this out the hard way this week when I was the only one in my family who packed a go-bag. My moms a diabetic and guess who didn't pack her meds in a easy-to-reach bag. And guess who had to spend 2 hours in the cold garage trying to find which of the 50 boxes contained her meds.
