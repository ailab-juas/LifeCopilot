LPT: when making nachos, put a tortilla underneath your chips to turn leftover toppings into a taco.

Also helps with cleanup (no cheese stuck to plate).

Edit: RIP Inbox!  Glad so many of you enjoyed my LPT!  And thank you for the golds, kind strangers--may you always pick the nacho stuck to other nachos (after all, it's still one nacho).
