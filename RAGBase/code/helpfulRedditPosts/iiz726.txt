title:
YSK that some of these so called animal rescue youtube channels actually abuse the animals rather than saving them

content:
 Why YSK: To try to raise awareness on this issue. These youtubers will put animals such as dogs and cats into harms way for some internet clout and money. They will "save" these animals from clearly staged situations. Thses disgusting human pieces of trash will purposely injure or trap animals to come and "rescue" them later on. Some of these channels show the same dog or cats in multiple videos. Some of these rescues are so poorly staged. Its shameless. Please don't fall for their bullshit.

Be warned that this may be not for the light of heart so do watch with caution.
