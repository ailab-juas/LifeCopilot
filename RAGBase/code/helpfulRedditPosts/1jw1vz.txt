title:
LPT Flip the pill bottle after taking pills

content:
So I was recently prescribed some pills that I have to take every 12 hours. One of the occasionally difficult things is remembering if I've taken my pills or not. 

What I've done is written "take morning" on the bottle right side up, and "take evening" upside down. Now, every time I take my pill, I flip the bottle. If I'm worried about whether or not I've taken my pills, I just look for my note- if "take evening" is right side up, and it's the evening, then I haven't taken the pills yet. Etc.
