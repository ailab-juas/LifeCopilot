LPT: If you are about to be in a situation where it may be a life-safety issue if someone in your group can't swim well, ask explicitly beforehand if everyone can swim well enough for anticipated conditions.

content:
(Example: weekend trip with friends to a lake). According to the Red Cross, 54% of Americans can't swim, or lack basic swimming skills. Don't assume your friends can swim, or that those who can't swim will recognize or avoid potentially dangerous situations. 

Bonus: ask specific questions. Asking if everyone has had swim lessons, or if everyone "can swim" might not be sufficient. A lake/ocean is not at all the same as an 80**Â°,** five-foot pool.

You might get laughed at, a friend might have to admit they can't swim super well, and you may have to be the gracious person who waits with someone on the shore. It's worth all of this to avoid a situation that can quickly become life threatening.
