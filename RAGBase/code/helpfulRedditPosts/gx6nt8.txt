YSK: Yellowstone is NOT "overdue" for an eruption. Not only is that not how volcanos work, only 5-15% of the magma in the magma chamber under the volcano is actually molten. The rest is completely solid and stable.

content:
That isn't to say that the volcano could *never* have another supereruption, but scientists do not believe it *ever will.*

The "overdue" myth stems from the average time between the three eruptions in the volcano's life. Which is the average of two numbers, which is functionally useless.

But even if it wasn't useless and it *was* rock-solid evidence of an eruption, we **still** wouldn't be overdue. There's still 100,000 years to go before we reach the average time between eruptions.
