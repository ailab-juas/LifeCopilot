YSK: When putting out a bon fire or camp fire on the beach, do not just bury it. Extinguish with water.

Why YSK:  If you are enjoying a fire on the beach and ready to put it out, do not just bury the coals.  Pour water on the fire to put it out.  Burying the hot coals will continue to burn into the next day.  The sand acts as an insulation.  If a child or dog playing in the sand digs where you buried your fire, that child or dog could burn themselves the next day.
