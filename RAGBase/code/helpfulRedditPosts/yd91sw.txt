LPT: When buying a "New construction" home especially from mass producers, always hire your own independent home inspection contractor and never go with the builders recommendation.

content:
Well for any home make sure you do this but make sure you hire someone outside of what the builder and sometimes the realtor recommends. I dealt with two companies one that the builder recommended and one that my family did. My family inspector found 10 things in addition wrong with the house vs what the builders recommended inspector said.

Edit: For the final walk through make sure you hire another one just to make sure.
