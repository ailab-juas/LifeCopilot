LPT: “How do you not know how to do that at X years old?” is the worst response to an adult asking you how to do something basic. Always show them what they need as if it’s a totally reasonable thing to ask.

content:
Someone at some point has neglected to teach them how to tie their shoelaces or peel an onion, and if they’re asking that means they want to know (they’re not just lazy or stupid). Odds are they have overcome some embarrassment in asking you in the first place, and embarrassing them more will just stop them from asking again.

EDIT: I obviously mean if someone asks you HOW to do something, not to do it for them.

EDIT 2: I used the word “ignorant” in the original post which I guess isn’t exactly the right word for what I meant. Thank you for pointing this out!
