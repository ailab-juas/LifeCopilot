YSK: If you are a new homeowner in a snowy climate, it is ideal to have an assortment of different types of shovels if you can.

**Why YSK: Not all snow shovels are created equal. There are shovels built to lift, shovels built to push, and those made to do both** (like the Head &amp; Shoulders of shovels).

For lighter snowfall, you will appreciate having a wider (30" or 36") snow pusher that is lower profile and allows you to easily move light snow and cover more ground quickly.  These shovels are best in 3" or less.

For the end of the driveway after the plow has come through, use a bucket style (or "combination")  shovel to lift heavier and more compact snow that you need to lift &amp; carry to it's spot.  If there is big-time accumulation, you'll be happy to have a scooping shovel (similar to what you may see on a farm) (**edit**: *another user in the comments below pointed out that the term I'm looking for is GRAIN SHOVEL*) that can more easily grab deep snow. 

There are plenty of other designs as well for ergonomics,  bad backs and dual-hand placement and even one I've seen with wheels, so do a little research to find whatever is right for you.  But my message is about owning &amp; having an assortment of 2-3 different shovels for different types of snow accumulation throughout the season.  Shoveling snow is wildly easier for me these days than my first year of homeownership when I just had one basic combination shovel I bought on the cheap.
