LPT: When authenticating an account with private information (like SSN) give an almost correct answer to test that the company you called is actually checking it and not phishing you.

I just thought of this when I called my retirement account manager.  She authenticated me but I didn't authenticate her. At the least I can check to see if she is checking actual information rather than phishing me for mine!

Of course, this is for calls that you already feel are legitimate. If someone calls you out of the blue with no context never give them private information.
