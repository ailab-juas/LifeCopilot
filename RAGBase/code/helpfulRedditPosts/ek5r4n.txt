LPT: Donate your old gaming systems and games to a Children's Hospital

content:
Libraries don't usually take them. You get nothing for them if you trade them in, and you may not get much if you sell it.  However, Children's hospitals have kids of various ages who have to spend weeks there at times and would love to play them over and over as they try and get better.  We gave a PS2 system with a bunch of games to a Children's hospital and they were incredibly grateful.

Edit: It seems that YMMV on the hospital as some like myself, have had success, some have not.  So call ahead.  

For UK:  https://getwellgamers.org.uk/donate/donate-games/   (per the Chair of the organization who posted in this thread, they definitely take used equipment)

If your local Children's hospital does not take it, some places that would also happily take them have been mentioned: 


Ronald McDonald houses (places where families of sick kids stay)


Women's domestic abuse shelters


Homeless shelters for families


Assisted livings-senior communities (for Wii)

Children's homes/adoption agencies

Children's Psych units (especially with wireless controllers)

Group/residential homes
