LPT Indecision is worse than a bad decision make a decision and make it work.

content:
In order to move forward with any problem a decision needs to be made. So make it and then work on making your decision work.

Edit: Lots of people disagreeing but just for clarification I am not talking about committing crime or making wildly bad decisions. I mean when faced with a situation that can go two ways chose one and make it work. Which as some have suggested includes reflection and a change of course if necessary.
