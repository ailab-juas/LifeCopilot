LPT: If your manager/supervisor ask you to do something you really shouldn't (especially Health &amp; Safety wise) ask them to put it to you in writing

content:
You'll see how quickly their attitudes change 

Its a more polite way of refusing to do the work. 
"I'm not gonna do that" 
"I don't want to do it" make YOU seem like the problem

If they DO put it to you in writing, refuse to do the work anyway, then it's not a place you want to stay. If you get fired then you have grounds for Unfair Dismissal
