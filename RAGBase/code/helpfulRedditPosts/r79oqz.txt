LPT Do you need to schedule something for midnight? Schedule it for either 11:59 PM or 12:01 AM instead.

Hi there, I have a boring IT job where I schedule a lot of meetings at all hours of the day, servicing global clients. You'd think even with computer-kept schedules you wouldn't run into this issue, but you do. I've found that when you schedule something for, say "Midnight on Tuesday" people will still ask, "So which midnight do you mean?" Do you mean midnight at the end of Monday, which is when Tuesday begins, or do you mean midnight at the end of Tuesday? Though that's technically Wednesday, people still oftentimes consider that "midnight on Tuesday".

So just schedule it for one minute before or after, and avoid confusion. "11:59 pm Tuesday" leaves no ambiguity, neither does "12:01 am Wednesday". It will save you a lot more headaches than you realize.

Edit: A lot of people are saying "Why are you scheduling things at midnight?" First, I prefer graveyard shifts. I'm just a night person. /shrug Second, in IT a lot of maintenance and change work is done during offline hours because there's minimal impact on the operations.  Third, I am scheduling things all around the world, usually relative to the client. So I might be on a Zoom call with someone in London and, because of point two, they'll say, "Schedule (some activity) for midnight." So it's not always **my** midnight I'm scheduling for.

Edit 2: I also agree that 24 hour time is superior. Unfortunately, people are idiots. And a lot of them wind up in upper management positions. I can't tell you how many times I set something for 24 hour time, and someone chimes in that they're confused, and they want to know what it is in "real time". It was more of a hassle using 24 hour time in my current environment.
