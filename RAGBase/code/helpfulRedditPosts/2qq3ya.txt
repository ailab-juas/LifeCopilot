LPT: If you're not already, you should be doing Kegel exercises! Both men and women. Info and links inside.

In addition to helping with any urinary leakage issues, they can lead to better orgasms (and orgasm control)  for both sexes, as well as better muscle control of your sexy bits. 

For men, they can also help with prostate issues and premature ejaculation, and for women they can help with things like stress and urge incontinence and pelvic floor weakness after childbirth. 

Even if you are good to go now, later in life these will help forestall the need for urinary incontinence aids (like DependsÂ®)

Kegel exercises can be done just about anywhere and done discreetly (I'm doing them right now!)
