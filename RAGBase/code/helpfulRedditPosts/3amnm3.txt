LPT (Request): How to take a short energizing nap?

content:
I don't nap, I just sleep. The moment my eyes shut, unless another person is physically moving me, I sleep hard. I go to school in the morning and I drive Uber in the evening. I tried to nap in between school and driving and ended up waking up way later than intended, sleeping through all of my alarms. Anyone have tips to nap better? 
[Edit]
Thank you for all the tips! 
So far, it seems that drinking coffee or taking some caffeine is helpful for taking short naps and feeling energized. 
20-40 min naps seem to be the general length people have recommended. People have suggested 90 min naps to get the full sleep cycle. 
Meditation is also an alternative to napping.
