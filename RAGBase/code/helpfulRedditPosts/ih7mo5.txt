LPT you can bring your own snacks to the airport instead of paying an arm and a leg!

Current/former flight attendant here! I just recently travelled as a regular passenger and had to go through TSA for the first time in almost 4 years. Airlines are not really doing cart service or snack and beverage services so I figured I would be my own flight attendant.

Pack your own snacks in a separate container/bag per TSA guidelines listed [here!](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/food) Save the big bucks. This is an extra great tip if you’re travelling with a bunch of kids. I believe they do have to be packed separate so for your own sake, don’t pack it in your roller suitcase. Also, things have to be sealed so resist snack temptation. Anything liquid still has to be under 3.4 ounces. I usually do either a little lunch bag or plastic grocery bag.

Edit: here‘s my little lunch bag filled with airline munchies — [peewoop](https://imgur.com/a/uVbZAnj)
