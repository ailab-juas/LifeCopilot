LPT: if you need an uber/lyft/rideshare from the airport, get on a shuttle to a hotel, car rental, literally anywhere else besides the airport and order your car there. You’ll save a LOT of money.

I do this every time I land home at LAX and my uber price goes from the gouged $40-50 minimum to around $11–and I live close by. I’ve done it at other airports as well with similar success.
