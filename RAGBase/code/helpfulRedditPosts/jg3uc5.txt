YSK: Not every child who is abused is aware of it.

This  might sound bizarre to many. But it is possible for severely abused  children's brains to develop an coping mechanism which blocks off the  memories of the abuse.

I was  abused by my parent in multiple different ways over the course of 11  years, and the memories of the abuse only started to return to my  awareness 10 years after it had ended.

If  you suspect a child does not have everything alright at home, please  try to get them help. Do not expect that a child would just tell if they  are getting abused. Even if they did remember it, they might be  literally scared for their life, and then there are those like me, who  can't tell or ask for help for themselves.

Why YSK? You can save a child's life.  Just because I wasn't aware of it until later in my life doesn't mean it did not cause me or my life issues. I really wish someone would had seen the signs and tried to get me the help I needed.
