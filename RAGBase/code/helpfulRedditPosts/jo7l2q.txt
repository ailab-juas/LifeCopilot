title:
YSK that dogs are much more likely to come back and drop the toy when playing fetch if you have another toy in your hand ready to throw.

content:
Why YSK: This is particularly useful with dogs when they are stubborn and won't bring the ball/frisbee back and especially when they won't drop it for you to throw again. Just show them the new toy and they'll drop what's in their mouth. Throw the backup and grab the last toy for the next round of fetch.

Edit: Jesus Christ, people. This is not meant to completely replace any and all training while playing fetch. Of course you should still teach your dog to drop the toy and of course there are many ways to teach them that, but the reality is that most dogs just want to play and most people don't necessarily feel the need to treat play time with their dog like a military boot camp. This trick is only meant to help incentivize your dog to drop the toy and keep play time moving smoothly. I promise that everyone can still have a well trained and well behaved dog even if they utilize this method.
