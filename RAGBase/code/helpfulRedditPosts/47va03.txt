LPT: Friend had a baby? By 6-9 month clothes. And skip the hats

content:
Babies bring out the best in peoples gift giving habits.  There are a few staple items that people tend to buy when someone has a new baby.

Size newborn diapers.
Cute pacifiers and hats.
Newborn and 3 month old clothes.

Be different.  Buy some size 6 months or size 9 months clothes instead of size 3.

Any baby born in high 7 or low 8 pounds will outgrow newborn sizes within a day or two (if they fit in them at all).  Do a little math and try to buy some clothes that they'll use in a couple months and get them in size 6.  Or something they'll wear in about 6-7 months and get size 9 months.

A lot of babies don't like their legs being cramped, and clothes that are too small will be tight on their feet.

Not to mention, lots of people will be buying size 3 month clothes.  So some will end up being regifted.

Any baby born with hair will likely not wear a hat at all aside from their initial trip home.  

Edit:  yes, babies wear hats outside.  But a lot don't wear them in the house.

Also, I'm aware of my typo.  I get it.

ITT: A lot of exceptions who think they are the rule
