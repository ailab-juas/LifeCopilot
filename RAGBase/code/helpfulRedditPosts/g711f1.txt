LPT: If you feel the need to cry, even if it's for a "stupid" reason, just cry it out, it's okay

content:
I'm a guy and it's always been implied that guys shouldn't cry because it shows some kind of weakness. That is bullshit. For any person - crying is a release of emotion that can make you feel better. Don't be afraid to cry it out, it's normal and healthy to do sometimes.
