YSK that there is a baroque audio stream out of Athens, Greece that plays nonstop 15th and 16th-century tunes throughout the day with zero ads. This is like, really beautiful relaxing music to help ease your tattered nerves and mend your broken spirit, cannot recommend highly enough.

[and here is the TuneIn link](https://tunein.com/radio/Audiophile-Baroque-s197572/); it's the only classical bookmark I ever need. It's called Audiophile Baroque in case you need to search for it because that link is causing your problems, as I see it has for some in the comments below.
