YSK that you don't actually need to share your email when signing up for things

content:
instead of giving away this information and having your inbox flooded with spam and scam emails

you can go to [www.guerrillamail.com](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) where they will hook you up with a temporary, disposable email address!

just don't let the freedom go to your head..
