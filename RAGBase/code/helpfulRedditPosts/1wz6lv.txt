YSK that you can get free HDMI cables from Comcast by asking!

content:
That's right, just call Comcast and tell them you need some HDMI cables (when I asked, they didn't say there was a maximum) and they will send right to your home!   
The source I'm linking you to is from 2008, but I tried it recently and they are still doing it.
