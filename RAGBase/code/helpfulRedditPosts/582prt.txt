LPT: If you're having a foreign guest over for dinner, don't make them food native to their country

content:
People like to think that they will impress the person they are cooking for but likely it won't be as good as what they're used to. Also if they are from that country they will be used to eating that food, making the meal less exciting for them.

If you are an experienced cook and like to make your own twist on popular dishes then obviously this advice isn't for you.

Also I hope I don't come across as ungrateful, I still appreciate it when people cook for me. I am just a little disappointed I missed out on eating something amazing because you tried to cater to me.
