LPT: Every gun is always loaded at all times and can discharge for no reason at all.

content:
This should always be your mindset. Mindfully, never point a firearm at anything you do not intent to kill. Never put your finger in the trigger guard unless you are ready to shoot. A firearm should only ever be considered "not loaded" once it has been dissembled. Do not tolerate bad firearm etiquette from those around you.    


There are no gun accidents, only stupid people.
