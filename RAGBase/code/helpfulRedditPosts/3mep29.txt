LPT: Request- I am a middle aged man. I have low self esteem and confidence. I devalue myself a lot. People do not take me seriously. Due to this all my talents and positives can't be showcased effectively. How can I change all this?

content:
LPT:I also have social anxiety though it's not prominent. I find it tiring to make small talk and always read too much into body language and conversations. This happens automatically.

Edit: Thank you everyone for all the replies!! I will go through each comment. This is helping me and I also hope the suggestions help someone who has similar conditions or just help change for the betterment of mind, body and soul, living life happily.

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold stranger!! My first! Thank you so much for the replies everyone! I still haven't read everything and looking forward to reading them all.
