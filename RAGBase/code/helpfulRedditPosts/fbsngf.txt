LPT: Fix Google Maps before selling your house

content:
I live outside London in a commuter town, so living close to the train station is *the* main thing people look for when buying.

When we bought our house, Google (and so all of the major property portals) said it was 0.6 miles to the station. I noticed that a bunch of footpaths and shortcuts in my neighbourhood were missing from Google maps, so submitted changes which showed up about a week later.

We're now selling our house, and the distance to the station has more than halved - the house is now listed as being 0.27 miles to the station! The agent thinks this has boosted the price of the house by a few %, and has resulted in strong interest from Londoners moving out to our town 

Tl;dr: Fix Google maps to be closer to transport hubs

Edit: we hit the front page! Lots of people saying that Google doesn't accept changes for most users, so it's probably worth pointing out that I am a level 6 local guide (did it years ago because I thought that maybe it could eventually be useful). You can become a high level local guide by searching for every ATM/cash machine in your area, and setting its opening hours to 24 hours, and/or reviewing it.
