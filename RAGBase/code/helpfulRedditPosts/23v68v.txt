LPT: Having problems with ance? Your pillow case might be adding to the problem.

content:
Oils from your skin get on your pillow case as you sleep. If you dont wash it very often you might notice a higher occurance of acne. The problem is very evident if you sleep on one side and notice that most of your acne is the same side of your face. Not a cure by any means but definitly a good mitigation.

EDIT: Yes i mispelled acne. Get over it.
