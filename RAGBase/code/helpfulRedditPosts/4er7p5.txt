YSK There's a website to make your life easier when discovering intimate fantasies of a couple

content:
Found out that there's a lot of people don't know of [Mojo Upgrade](http://mojoupgrade.com/) (link has NSFW text, so be advised). It's a website where a couple can answer simple questions about their sexual preferences/fantasies and then compare answers. The good thing is that you two only see what matched, so if you are really into &lt;fetish&gt; but your partner isn't, they won't see that.

There're some android and iOS apps that have a similar idea, and the site doesn't look that good, but I know many instances where awkward conversations were avoided and great sex lives were born!

I am not affiliated to the website at all, I just used it some weeks ago and worked wonders.
