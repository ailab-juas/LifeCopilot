title:
LPT: Get out of your comfort zone occasionally and go out on weekends by yourself

content:
I used to force myself to do this every once in a while when I was younger and it really changed my life.  I still do this occasionally too.  We often settle into these groups of friends and start to rely on them to have fun, but before long you realize you've built a reliance on them... Half the time people go out, they stand in the same circle and talk about the same shit.  Go out by yourself.  You'll learn to socialize, meet new people, and likely have a hell of a time.  I've had some of my most fun nights this way and made some great friends that have lasted through the years.
