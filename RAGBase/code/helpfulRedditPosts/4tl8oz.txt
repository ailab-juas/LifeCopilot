YSK: If you're a Google Keyboard user, swiping left or right across the space bar moves the cursor.

content:
This is super handy for those of you who have a bit of trouble getting the cursor precisely where it needs to be before you start typing, removing, pasting, etc.

*Edit: Apparently this and the swipe backspace to delete also describes some rogue cursor/deletion behavior some have been experiencing. This can be disabled in Long press comma -&gt; Google Keyboard settings (gear icon) -&gt; Gesture typing -&gt; Enable gesture delete/cursor control.*

*Edit 2: Make sure you're using Google Keyboard out of the app store and not the stock AOSP keyboard. Especially for those of you using Cyanogen or other custom roms.*

Cheers.
