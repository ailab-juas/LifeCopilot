LPT: If you think you have an Alcohol Addiction, you probably do. The best thing you can do is get it early before you start getting withdrawals. Go to rehab, meetings, detox, or talk to someone.

Edit: It means so much to me knowing that this post is touching people in ways I would of never thought. Another thing is Alcohol Withdrawal, along with Benzodiazepine withdrawal are the two most DANGEROUS withdrawals that you can have. In most cases a medically supervised detox is VERY necessary. You can have seizures from these withdrawals and they can kill you. I had a seizure last February when I quit for good. I was thickheaded and stubborn and thought I could do it on my own. Luckily my parents were at my house and called an ambulance and from there I went to a medically assisted detox and then Rehab for 14 days. I joined the gym and went to meetings as soon as I got out of the Rehab.
