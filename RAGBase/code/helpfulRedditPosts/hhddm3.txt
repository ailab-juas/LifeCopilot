YSK: Your cluttered sidewalk/walkway may be impeding upon a disabled person's independence and self-worth

content:
My dad lost his left leg a year before I was born and for the past 5 years has been confined to a wheelchair. We went for a stroll on the sidewalk the other day and one of our neighbors had their walkway littered with debris -- tree branches upon tree branches, doing yard work probably -- which made the sidewalk completely inaccessible for him. I moved every piece of wood from concrete to grass while being told repeatedly "It's okay, it's okay, let's just go home."

It's understandable to expect other able-bodied people to easily walk around such inconveniences but for some people these (what seem to be) simple inconveniences can affect their overall livelihood and sense of independence (a desperately needed thing for most, if not all, people). If you own a spot of land with a sidewalk YSK that keeping it clear can really make or break someone's day.

Not sure if this has been mentioned before, sorry if it has been.
