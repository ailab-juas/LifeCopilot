LPT: Never feel awkward or afraid to reach out to an old friend after a long time of no contact.

content:
Assuming you last spoke with them a while ago and ended on good terms, theyâ€™ll only be pleasantly surprised for you to reach out and if anything, were probably afraid themselves to reach out to you! Talking to a good friend after a long hiatus usually should feel like you just talked to them yesterday.
