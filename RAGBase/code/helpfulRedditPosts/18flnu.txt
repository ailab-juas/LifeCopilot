LPT: When going to a job interview always bring a bottle of water a 3 copies of your resume.

**water a 3 = water and 3** in the title.

This might seem obvious to some, but you can't imagine the amount of brownie points you score, when you walk into an interview and there are 2+ people interviewing you and only one of them has your resume in hand.

I usually just open my suitcase and hand a copy to everyone who is not holding one, including myself.

Without even opening your mouth you are most likely already ahead of other candidates, just by showing your ability to prepare.

And yeah, the water, it also helps to have it with you (pee before the interview!!!) because the last thing you want happening is not being able to continue talking because your mouth dried up!

Oh, one last tip, ALWAYS keep everything in your left hand, just so you ALWAYS have your right hand free to shake hands.

It's the small things that matter at the end of the day!
