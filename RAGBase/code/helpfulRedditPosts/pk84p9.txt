title:
LPT: If you're being contacted about taking extra shifts but are unable, do not give a specific reason why you can not come in

content:
Your employer or the people responsible for making sure someone covers that shift, will remember what reason you gave. Often enough will this spread to your workmates. Nobody at work should either in their head, or by talking to others judge how you spend your own free time

Do not give people an opportunity to scrutinize your life and your choices
