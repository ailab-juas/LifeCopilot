YSK common misconceptions about sexual consent

content:
It's important to understand sexual consent because [sexual activity without consent is sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault). Before you flip out about how "everyone knows what consent is," that is absolutely not correct! Some (in fact, [many](https://globalnews.ca/news/2208421/getconsent-two-thirds-of-canadians-dont-fully-understand-sexual-consent/)) people are legit confused about what constitutes consent, such as [this teenager who admitted he would ass-rape a girl because he learned from porn that girls like anal sex](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news), or [this ostensibly well-meaning college kid who put his friend at STI risk after assuming she was just vying for a relationship when she said no](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/1/24/16925444/aziz-ansari-me-too-feminism-consent), or [this guy from the "ask a rapist thread" who couldn't understand why a sex-positive girl would not have sex with him](https://jezebel.com/5929544/rapists-explain-themselves-on-reddit-and-we-should-listen), or [this guy who haplessly made a public rape confession in the form of a comedy monologue](https://jezebel.com/5834712/is-this-comedy-monologue-a-rape-confession). In fact, [researchers have found that in aquaintance rape--which is one of the most common types of rape--perpetrators tend to see their behavior as seduction, not rape, or they somehow believe the rape justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape).  

[Misperception of sexual intent is one of the biggest predictors of sexual assault](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139770/). 

Yet [sexual assault is a tractable problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4660251/). [More of us being wise can help bring justice to victims of sexual violence](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a11f/cc161e2f008497a74ae4c3ae9cd72e17fd3a.pdf). And yes, a little knowledge [can actually reduce the incidence of sexual violence](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/SV-Prevention-Technical-Package.pdf).

* **[An overwhelming majority of people require *explicit*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20620316.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35795183e914dfef5bad76292e6e685f) (i.e. [unambiguous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/explicit)) consent for any sexual activity beyond kissing in a new relationship**. However, [even an unwanted kiss can be fatal if the person being advanced upon feels unsafe due to a large discrepancy in size/strength](https://globalnews.ca/news/4174526/gay-panic-murder-charge-lesser-sentence-austin/).   

* [**"Token resistance" to sex is virtually nonexistent, particularly for first encounters**. The overwhelming majority of men and women who say no to sexual advances really do mean no](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1998.tb00167.x). It's **never** reasonable to assume that when someone says no, they don't really mean it (unless you have previously mutually agreed to role-play and have decided on an alternative safe word, in which case it's not an assumption) [even if the person has sent extremely "mixed signals,"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260517699948) or even [engaged in some sexual contact](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent) ([as many sexual offenses often entail](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484276/)).

* [As in other social interactions, **sexual rejections typically are communicated with softened language** ("Next time," "Let's just chill," "I really like you, but...") **and often don't even include the word "no."**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957926599010003002) These [rejections are still rejections](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9), and [any subsequent sexual activity is still sexual assault](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Nebraska&amp;group=9). [Both men and women are capable of understanding these types of refusals, and to pretend otherwise is disengenuous](https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/mythcommunication-its-not-that-they-dont-understand-they-just-dont-like-the-answer/). [Perpetrators often misrepresent their own actions to garnish support, avoid responsibility, blame the victim, and conceal their activities](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957926504045031), and [re-labeling sexual assault or rape as a "miscommunication" accomplishes those goals](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.360.5138&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). It may not be a good idea to recommend to someone that they try to communicate more forcefully, because [like domestic abusers, rapists often feel provoked by blows to their self-esteem](http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/papers/baumeistersmartboden1996[1].pdf), so encouraging someone to [communicate in ways that are considered rude](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/KITZINGER_FRITH_Just_Say_No.pdf) could actually lead them to danger. [1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men has experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/infographic.html), so it is far from outrageous to take precautions against physical violence by being polite. 

* [**Most young women expect words to be involved when their partner seeks their consent**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). [43% of young men actually ask for verbal confirmation of consent](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/masculinity-survey/masculinity-survey.csv). Overall, [verbal indicators of consent or nonconsent are more common than nonverbal indicators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). 

* [**Consent is not synonymous with desire**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-013-0225-7). For one, there are common misconceptions that [an erect penis](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1097184x08322632) or [erect nipples](https://my3.my.umbc.edu/groups/archive/discussions/8342) necessarily signify sexual arrousal. It's also [possible for someone to be aroused and still not want to have sex](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20620289.pdf?casa_token=A6WLuaSUlO0AAAAA:X8qnOoj-elReye_Y4UDM7OI2URjliYnOtHyEvwY95_3dYK48nqebSK_NiXAz8vUvgHxDjqF3Uro4ER-jzUFu7vtNjeKJW-ZfPDs5LY14zufSl2goP2Ve). [Misperception of sexual interest may increase risk of sexually coercive or aggressive behavior](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/sites/psychology.uiowa.edu/files/groups/treat/files/Treat%20et%20al_,%202016.pdf), and [studies consistently show men perceive women's actions to be more sexual than the woman intends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Consent) ([93% have misperceived sexual interest on at least one occassion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/), though [most don't respond with sexual contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455931/)). Men who date women are [less likely to accurately label sexual assault when the victim's interest is even a little ambiguous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294695). [Sex with an aroused person who hasn't consented is still sexual assault](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault).  

* [**Consenting to engage in some sexual activity does not imply consent for further sexual activity**](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent). [The law is clear that one may consent to one form of sexual contact without providing blanket future consent to all sexual contact](https://journals.cdrs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/Brodsky_Final_PRINT.pdf), yet [most sexual assault on college campuses happens during a hookup when a man forces a higher level of sexual intimacy than the woman consented to](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.3316&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). 

* [**Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent**](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape), [nor does the law require evidence of injury in order for consent to be deemed absent](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php). [Women who try to physically resist rapes are more likley to end up physically injured, while those who try to argue or reason with the offender are less likely to be injured](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1015254631767.pdf). The increased probability of injury [may be small, but the consequences serious](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.8460&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf).

* **[Consent](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Vermont&amp;group=9) can be [legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=District%20of%20Columbia&amp;group=9) communicated [verbally or nonverbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9), and [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&amp;group=9) be [specific to engage in the sexual activity in question.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_rape#Canada)**. Behaviors which don't meet the bar for communicating explicit consent for a particular sexual behavior (like [accepting an alcoholic beverage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072826)) are at best indicators of [likelihood for future consent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X17308571).

* **[Nonconsent can legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Nebraska&amp;group=9) be communicated [verbally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20York&amp;group=9) or by [pulling away](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Hawaii&amp;group=9) or [other](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&amp;group=9) nonverbal [conduct](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&amp;group=9)**.   

* **[Submitting to sex](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Florida&amp;group=9) is [not legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Delaware&amp;group=9) the [same as consent to sex](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/cases/R-v-Olugboja.php)**. [Some sex offenders kill their victims to avoid getting caught](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235213000470); [victims often become compliant during an assault as a protective measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological). 

* **[Intoxication is not](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&amp;group=9) a [legally defensible excuse for failure to get consent](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php)**. [Deliberately getting a victim too drunk to resist is a tactic used by some perpetrators to commit sexual assault or rape](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1125&amp;context=psychfacpub). There is also evidence that [intoxicated men who are attracted to a woman are particularly likely to focus their attention on signs of sexual interest and miss or discount signs of disinterest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/). [Sober sex tends to be more enjoyable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650).

* **[It's possible](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Maryland&amp;group=9) for someone to be [too intoxicated](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Louisiana&amp;group=9) to [give valid consent](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=South%20Dakota&amp;group=9)**. Contrary to popular belief, [alcohol is not an aphrodisiac](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650)
If someone is blackout drunk, it's a good idea to assume they cannot consent to sex. [Here are some easy ways to tell if a person is blackout drunk](http://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/StudentServices/StudentSuccess/How_to_Test_for_Blackouts.pdf). [Most college sexual assaults occur when the victim is incapacitated due to intoxication or sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294944). 

* [**Wearing someone down by repeadedly asking for sex until they "consent" to sex is a form of coercion**. Some forms of coercion are also illegal in some jurisdictions](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf). Genuine consent [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Wisconsin&amp;group=9) be [freely given](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&amp;group=9).

* [**Silence is not consent**](https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault). [Fighting, fleeing, and **freezing**](https://cmhc.utexas.edu/stressrecess/Level_One/fof.html) are common fear responses, and thus not signs of consent. In fact, [most rape victims freeze in fear in response to unwanted sexual contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological), even though [most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape). 

* **[It is necessary to obtain consent from men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322)**, too, as [men are not in a consent state of agreement to sex](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1097184X08322632). 

* **Consent must happen *before* sexual contact is made**, or a violation has already occurred. [Legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&amp;group=9), sexual contact that takes a person [by surprise](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20Hampshire&amp;group=9) deprives them [of the opportunity](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Rhode%20Island&amp;group=9) to [communicate nonconsent](https://www.rainn.org/laws-your-state-montana). There is [often a long period of uncertainty described in victim's rape accounts where the she felt shocked by the rapist’s behavior and unsure of what was transpiring](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9963&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). In fact, [most unwanted fondling, and many rapes, occur because the victim didn't have time to stop it before it happened](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.3316&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). [Most victims also become compliant during an assault, which is a protective behavior that does not signify consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological). 

* **Consent is [ethically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-consensual_condom_removal#Legal_and_ethical_concerns) (and *[arguably](http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sc-stealthing-condom-removal-family-0427-20170427-story.html)* or [definitely](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-stealthing/swiss-court-upholds-sentence-in-stealthing-condom-case-idUSKBN1851UN) legally) required before removing a condom**. [Many people are unaware they have an STI they can transmit to a partner, there is an antibiotic resistant strain of gonorrhea on the rise that could literally kill someone](https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg/default.htm), [there is no reliable HPV test for men](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/hpvandmen-fact-sheet-february-2012.pdf), and [herpes might lead to Alzheimer's](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/21/621908340/researchers-find-herpes-viruses-in-brains-marked-by-alzheimers-disease). It's simply intolerable in a civilized society to knowingly expose someone to those risks without their knowledge or consent. 

* [**The NISVS includes using lies or false promises to obtain sex in their definition of sexual coercion**](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf). 

* ***Affirmative consent* is generally required on college campuses**. For examples, have a look at [Yale's sexual misconduct examples](https://smr.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual-Misconduct-Scenarios.pdf), [Purdue's consent policy](http://www.purdue.edu/policies/ethics/iiic1.html), [Illinois'](https://www.ethics.uillinois.edu/training/sexual_misconduct_training/employee_training_definitions/uic), [Michigan's](https://sapac.umich.edu/article/49), [Harvard's](https://osapr.harvard.edu/creating-culture-consent), [Stanford's](https://sara.stanford.edu/resources/consent), [Wisconsin's](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/prevention/violence-prevention/sexual-assault/), [Minnesota's](https://policy.umn.edu/hr/sexharassassault), [Indiana's](https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/oasis/education/justsayknow/know-consent.shtml), or [Arkansas'](https://provost.uark.edu/faculty-handbook/5-employment-records-sexual-assault-harrassment/04.php) university policies on sexual consent. [A requirement for affirmative permission reflects the contract-like nature of the sexual agreement; the partners must actively negotiate to change the conditions of a joint enterprise, rather than proceed unilaterally until they meet resistance.](https://journals.cdrs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/Brodsky_Final_PRINT.pdf)
