LPT: Guys growing out their beards or scruff, when trimming/grooming never trim your beard directly along your jawline - it'll you look like you have a double chin. You should leave at least a quarter to a half inch of hair on the neck.

Friendly reminder in honor of No-Shave Novembeard. Many newbie beard growers make the mistake of shaving their necklines way too high, often shaving off the hair on their necks completely to avoid acquiring the dreaded neckbeard status. They'll usually trace their beard directly along their jawline since this is the easiest point of reference to follow. However, doing this actually creates the illusion of a double chin and just generally looks bad.  Instead, the neckline of your beard should follow a gentle curve traced from the back of your ear, which will leave some hair on the neck itself.

**edit** Sorry for the typo in the title. Should say "It'll make you look like you have a double chin"

**edit 2** [This](http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/Node_Page/images/1310576332886_0.jpg) is too much neck

**edit 3** As others have mentioned, the "follow your ear" approach is by no means a one-trim fits all rule for beard growing,  but is a good guideline for starters. You should adjust your neckline to whatever looks best on your face with the desired length of your beard. However, its a pretty universal rule that you shouldn't shave directly along the jaw. 

**Bonus LPT** Many are mentioning that they already have a double chin. Actually, shaving lower on your neck and keeping a well maintained beardline will help mask your second (or even third) chin. The fuller the beard, the better coverage you'll get...but you can also sculpt stubble/scruff in a way that will distract from your extra chin fat if you don't want to go full lumberjack. Conversely, shaving higher will make it stand out more.
