title:
LPT: If someone shares a tragedy that occurred with them, do not respond with a similar/worse tragedy someone else went through.

content:
It doesn't usually help, and it sometimes minimizes one's tragedy.

Edit for context: my SO shared how she lost a loved one in an accident at a very young age, the opposite person responded with how it's similar to what Kobe's wife went through when she lost her kids and Kobe. One, it didn't actually help my SO, and two, it didn't add any actual value to the conversation. I understand that the opposite person didn't actually mean to trivialize SO's tragedy, nor was the response ill-intentioned. It's just something one usually responds with, in order to showcase empathy - I understand. I wanted to drop an LPT stating that it's OK to sometimes just listen, and not try to respond with something relatable to the tragedy.
