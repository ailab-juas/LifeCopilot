YSK that a pet is a terrible gift.

content:
Why YSK: Caring for a pet is an enormous amount of work. Animal shelters are often flooded with unwanted animals after the holidays as people figure this out.

Surprising someone with years of responsibility is a horrible idea. An animal should be something the person has planned for, knows how to take care of, and is a good match for them. If you want to give someone a pet, you should discuss it with them far in advance and let them choose. 

If someone wants a pet, give them toys or treats instead. They can pick out an animal on their own. 

Please don't give someone a puppy because it looks like they need one. Animals aren't for everyone. They may not have the time, resources or living situation to support it.

If your child wants a pet, bring them to a shelter to pick one out instead. Also be ready to care for it when your child slacks.
