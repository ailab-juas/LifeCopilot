title:
YSK that religiosity is a bigger predictor of perceived problematic porn use than actual frequency of consumption.

content:
Why YSK: There's a lot of information out there about porn addiction and how harmful it can supposedly be to the viewer. However, a lot of research points to it being more about the user than the actual porn. 

This isn't to say that users can't develop less-than-healthy worldviews or habits around porn. However, it is to say that reports of problematic porn use are often unintentionally exaggerated.
