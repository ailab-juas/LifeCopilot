YSK about another consequence of the DOMA ruling: same-sex couples can refile their old federal tax returns as "Married filing-jointly," which could get them big refunds

Hopefully this saves a few redditors some money. It seems to be getting lost in all of the political hubbub, but I'm sure we will hear more about it in coming days.

[Forbes has a little piece about it](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2013/06/26/supreme-court-recognizes-same-sex-marriage-now-amend-your-return-tax-refunds/).

edit: Some people are reading too much into the word "consequence" - I don't mean for that to be a value judgement. I am actually quite pleased about today's ruling.
