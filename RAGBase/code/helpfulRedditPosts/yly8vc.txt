YSK that if you don't like reading (or wish you read more), you might just not like fictional narratives.

Why YSK: Because you might be missing out on a source of entertainment and self-improvement that you haven't considered.

I thought I didn't like reading for a long time. Read a lot as a kid but then it just became a chore. I didn't realize that I just wasn't a huge fan of fiction books until I was about 20. I also wasn't a huge fan of sitting still and staring at a page.

Throughout school they have you read all these books and they're all fictional narratives or text books and so I got it in my head that "that's what reading is". Fiction and text books.

I started reading a lot more when I discovered narrative non-fiction. These books are non-fiction but they're not reference. More like a documentary.

I also started consuming a lot more books once I started listening to audiobooks on my commute, while doing chores, or while working out. I don't read very quickly and so sitting in one spot slowly ingesting a narrative isn't very interesting to me.

I realized that I enjoyed, in particular, the works of Mary Roach. My favorites are Stiff (about what we do with dead bodies), Gulp (about our digestive tract), and Bonk (about the history of sex research).

These kind of books are written with a conversational tone and tell a story about concepts that are interesting to you. Way more variety than what you can find via documentaries.

For example, I enjoy physics but the pop science documentaries and such have gotten pretty boring because it's made for a wide audience (and they tend to go over the same concepts repeatedly). I found a book called "Something Deeply Hidden" by Sean Carroll that I rather enjoyed and was right at my comprehension level.

**tl;dr:** Just because you didn't like having to read Catcher in the Rye doesn't mean you don't like books.

**Edit:**

Modification of my thoughts due to new ideas from the comments: I was projecting my experience onto others a decent amount with this. I found that non-fictional narratives are what I enjoy. But there's tons of styles and genres of content.

As with all information, it's important to be wary of the source, but ideas are ideas and some ideas are best expressed as a youtube video or a short story or a freaking interpretative dance. For some content, the method of transmission isn't important. For others, it can be. As several of you have said: Different content and methods of transmission appeal to different people; don't limit yourself to salad just because you grew up eating tomato soup and don't like tomatoes.
