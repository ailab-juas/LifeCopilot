LPT: Stretch for 5-10 minutes every day. Your body will thank you.

content:
I’m 29 years old and was facing the idea of regular cortisone injections for ongoing knee pain. I decided to see a physical therapist who put me on a daily stretching regimen. Not only is my knee pain entirely gone (I’m able to jog without pain for the first time in years) but my body as a whole feels amazing. 5-10 minutes of stretching daily will do you body wonders.

Edit: for those commenting “exercise is more important” or “use those 10 mins for exercise instead” - I’m in no way saying that exercise is not important, or that stretching is more important than exercise. I exercise 3-4 times a week, BUT given how stretching (and not exercise) has specifically helped my knee pain, I’m passing that along to the world of Reddit to take it how you will! Also the “stretching has no known benefits” crowd… have you tried stretching before?
