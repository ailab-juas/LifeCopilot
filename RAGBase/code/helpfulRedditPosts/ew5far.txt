LPT: To help learn a language faster, watch children's shows from that country

content:
Watch them dubbed in english and subbed with english subtitles. Don't try watching dramas or documentaries and expect to improve rapidly.

Sorry if this has been posted before!

EDIT: I meant above if you want to learn a non-english language, watch shows in that language twice. Once dubbed in english, and once native version with english subs.
