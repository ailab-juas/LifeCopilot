LPT: If you're getting rid of blankets or towels that aren't in good enough condition for a charity shop, offer them to an animal shelter instead.

content:
Charity shops usually don't sell things that are frayed, torn or stained, but animal shelters get through huge amounts of sheets, blankets and towels and they really don't care about condition as long as it's clean. Heard this from the woman who runs the small local shelter I got my cats from.
