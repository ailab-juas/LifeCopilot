YSK: Grapefruit consumption should be avoided whilst taking medications.

content:
Many common drugs interact with grapefruit (and other citrus fruits to a lesser degree) potentially increasing their effect to toxic levels or making them ineffective. The effects have been seen 3 days after consumption and from as little as 200ml of grapefruit juice.

[Edit] I should have said **some** medications in my title.  My bad.  Really though, read the information sheet.  It's there for a reason and it can be quite surprising what some drugs can interact with.
