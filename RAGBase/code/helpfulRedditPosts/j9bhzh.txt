LPT: If you sell your Blue-ray player, log out of Netflix first.

content:
I picked up a used Blu-ray player from my local thrift shop, and the previous family did not do this. I have a Netflix, so I logged them out, but they could've had an unwanted Netflix moocher. Be careful folks.

Edit: Changed blue to blu.
