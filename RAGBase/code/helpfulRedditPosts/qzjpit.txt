title:
YSK that a lot of corporations believe each and every human resource is REPLACEABLE and have active plans to weed out their non-excutive highest earners annually.

Why YSK: Because the very high paying non-executive corporate position you may be applying for may in fact be shortening your tenure. In such companies HR assembles a list of highest earners and they get near the door.

 Edit: Thank you for the award. Appreciated it.
