A [panic attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack) is a moment when a person is at their most vulnerable. They can be frozen in place or frantically fleeing. They will be out of breath, trembling, sweating, experiencing high anxiety. Symptoms can vary between persons. u/Porichay *reminds us a focal seizure has the same symptoms. Try to make sure that the person is not having a seizure.*

This Tuesday I had a really bad panic attack when I was not at home. Someone found me and helped me. I was lucky that they knew what to do. To make sure that people like me are helped by people that know what to do, a couple of tips:

***You don't have to do all of these steps. Some will not apply and some will not be needed. Keep away from a person when it seems that your attempt to help is not helpful! (You should shield them from view and other persons then.)***

*Look at* [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/bpasfr/ysk_how_to_help_someone_in_a_panic_attack/enqy787?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) *by* u/dannyjayes1 *for really good tips from a professional! And* [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/bpasfr/ysk_how_to_help_someone_in_a_panic_attack/enrhg1o?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  u/cutieboops *too. I recommend.*

1. Help them to get back their breath. Sit down next to them and *breathe with them (instead of telling them to breathe slowly). According to* u/rem800 *this is something you should do to get them out of their panic attack, BEFORE you go on asking questions. Also hold their hand if they seem OK with that, and tell them "you're OK, I'm here, I'm helping" over and over again.*
2. Ask simple questions to get information. "Are you in a panic attack?" is a nice one to make sure that it's not a physical danger. *If they don't respond, don't keep asking. That doesn't help.*
3. Not everyone is comfortable with touch, so I'd advise staying away or at least asking if they are OK with being touched.
4. *It is important not to overwhelm the person. Sometimes it's best to be quiet and reduce stimulation (visual, audio, etc.) (thanks to* u/ravkanroyalty *)*
5. Help them to breathe and become calm by talking. Simple questions again. "What is your name?" "How old are you?" u/pinkbedsheet *adds that it can be helpful when you describe your movements, when they seem unable to see you. I remember that that calms me down too, because it grounds me.*
6. Ask them what you could do, again simply. "Can I take you to the porter of this building for help?" "Do you want to go home?" "Can I get you some water?" -- Notice that these are yes/no questions. If the person cannot talk, it is still possible to answer by head movements.
7. If they want you to help them get home or get to help, make sure that you do that in a safe way. For example, the person that helped me, helped me use public transport to get home. So I did not have to worry about sitting in a car with an unknown person.
8. If you go somewhere with them, walk slowly, take the easiest route, and ask them to say it when they feel uncomfortable by something you do.
9. If it's bad, you can to the ER with an issue like this (in the Netherlands). There will be doctors prepared to talk with people to calm them down. They can even get someone from the psychiatric department to help one. I don't know how it is in other countries -- *this tip does not apply to the US although* u/scuba-lemon *mentions that there are Urgent Care facilities in some states that might be able to offer good help for less money. Seems worth checking out!*

I hope you can use these tips to help someone with mental problems to become calm and get on their way safely!

Thank you in name of all the people with panic attacks &lt;3
