LPT: If you own a dog, please cut your chip bags down the sides with scissors before throwing them away.

**Required Gold Received/Front page Edit:** Thank you both (and I am happy that this hit the front)! I am glad that even though I made a horrible mistake that people are learning from it, like I did. I appreciate your kindness, along with everyone else who has left me condolences.

***I am not saying this is the only way to make sure your pets or children are safe from suffocating, but it is a 100% fool proof way to make sure the bags do not get stuck on their heads. It takes only a few seconds to cut the bags before you throw them out, and even when you do dispose of them properly sometimes dogs get into the trash. Even in cases where people have spent 50+ dollars on garbage cans that are meant to keep pets out there have been dogs who are smart enough to open the can, but not be able to get out or fall asleep from the lack of oxygen. For the cost of a pair of scissors and almost no time you can stop there from even being the chance that your pet or child could get their snout or head stuck.***

**TL;DR:  My dog got into a bag that I carelessly left out and suffocated. If I had been more aware of the danger I wouldn't have left the bag. Instead I would have taken the time to cut the bag so that it was a flat piece and then thrown it away, thus eliminating the dog from ever suffocating even if they got into the trash bin.**

-----
My dog ( who my boyfriend ironically named "Mai Dawg" - we called her Mai) just suffocated the other night by sticking her face into a thick, foily type, empty bag of chips. 

My boyfriend and I went out to let a family member's dogs outside for the night, before going to bed. We drove 5 minutes away and weren't even gone for 20 minutes at the most and when we came back my mother told me my dog had died. My brother who was only a few rooms away heard nothing, and they tried to help her, but it was too late. 

PLEASE, when you finish eating chips or have empty cereal bags or even dog food bags, cut the bags straight down the sides to that the plastic or whatever material is flat and can't wrap around your pet or even child doesn't suffocate.

[This was Mai Dawg.](http://i.imgur.com/KbBfYYs.jpg) [Here are some funnier images of Mai Dawg.](http://imgur.com/a/tzD6T) She was going to be two years old the 28th this month. My boyfriend and I loved her so much, and we will never throw out another bag without cutting it apart first.

**Edit:** To anyone telling me I should have done something or my family is responsible, please realize that I know I made mistakes as a pet owner. I should have had an actual trash can in my bedroom. The dog was trained to not go in the trash and when she got caught she usually had ripped the paper up and was cowering because she knew it was wrong. Usually my boyfriend and I throw trash into a small bag that is hanging high enough for her to not get to - but I finished my chips and left the bag out on a table that the dog knew she wasn't supposed to take anything off for sure. I didn't think she would even get into anything in 15-20 minutes worth of time. We had left her for multiple hours before, and come back to nothing chewed on or eaten- but this time we came home to a dead dog. I said sorry a million times over while I held her. I said sorry I was such a fat ass and had to finish those chips immediately and then leave the bag out for her to choke and die on, but I will never let it happen again.

**Edit 2:** So, some people seem confused about how this exactly happened, so I am going to type out the events of the other night. **Edit 2.1** It goes along with the story, so I'll include this here. [My brother made a post about how he found Mai Dawg and what he immediately had to deal with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3925jw/lpt_if_you_own_a_dog_please_cut_your_chip_bags/cs03q6f?context=3)

I am currently watching my brother's dogs for him and doing some cleaning, while my sister-in-law is out of town, because he works very long hours and sometimes doesn't come home. My mom watched Mai Dawg all day while my boyfriend and I were on the other side of our small town. 

My mom watched the dog out in our garage, which is like my Dad's "Man Cave." There are multiple TVs, a fridge and two sofas and they don't mind pets being around in there because nothing is brand new or needs to stay pristine. Eventually, a family friend came over and my mom took the dog inside. Why? This family friend will sneak chocolate, and cheese, and whatever she thinks dogs can have "a little bit of" even though we have told her MULTIPLE times on MULTIPLE occasions to NOT FEED THE DOG. We came home after being at my brother's all day and Mai Dawg was happily waiting for us inside. Inside would pertain to half of my Family's first floor of the house. My bed room that my boyfriend and I share, a dining area, and a living room. A door or dog gate separated her from the kitchen and my other sibling's room.

We left later that night, after feeding Mai Dawg a while before, to go back to my brother's place and let the dogs out since my brother wasn't coming home that night. Right before we left we finished watching an episode of a show and I tossed a handful of the chips into my mouth and then folded the bag horribly and left it on my desk before rushing out the door. 

We came back approximately 20 minutes later and my mom and her friends were outside. My mom and I have a stomach condition and she had thrown up and passed out when she found Mai Dawg and was just coming out of the house because she heard me and my boyfriend come home. She told me that Mai Dawg was dead, and that my brother had found her after he looked down the hall and saw her - or something to that effect because I wasn't around to know exactly what happened. My brother pulled the bag off her head, but she was already not breathing so he ran to get my mom and her friends and they tried to perform CPR on her, but it was too late. 

The bag was a very thick material. Not a thin bag from something like a Lay's Chips bag, but more similar to Cheetos or Funyuns. These bags are a little more difficult to tear up and tend to be the most common bags to end up suffocating children or animals after disposal. 


/u/TrubbleWithTribbles made a [very long post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3925jw/lpt_if_you_own_a_dog_please_cut_your_chip_bags/crzvd3p) with a TL;DR that I think most people should read. It mentions some good things to know about the mental process of having to train certain types of dogs and why they may act out and do things like knock the trash over when you aren't around but never will when you are within sight.

*I just want people to know that I tried to be a responsible pet owner, but I made a mistake. There is even a vet in this thread that says s/he has never heard of this during their practice, but there were 2 other dogs besides my own this week alone that died this way.*
