YSK It's ok to be wrong.

content:
Being wrong doesn't make you less of a person. Being wrong does not invalidate you as a human being. No one is right about everything. Refusing to  acknowledge new information is more detrimental to your character than your opinion changing when presented with valid information. If your original opinion does not support the valid information then admit it and reevaluate. Your opinion will become more trustworthy and you will have earned respect as a result.
