YSK the term ‘synthetic marijuana’ should not be used when referring to spice or K2

content:
The media has a bad habit of tying in these harmful [synthetic chemicals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_cannabinoids) with the actual cannabis plant. Spice is not weed, it’s not a variation of weed, it’s a designer drug closer to bath salts and has nothing to do with plant-based cannabinoids like THC or CBD. It’s a poison and a dangerous chemical cocktail. Calling it synthetic marijuana is not only inaccurate, it makes it sound safe for consumption because people will associate a safe drug like marijuana with spice. People overdose and die every day smoking spice, the same can’t be said for marijuana. I don’t want this plant being confused with other harmful synthetic substances that try to market their product as a weed substitute. Most of you may already know the difference, but many young children are trying spice thinking it’s just as safe as weed. Let’s change the narrative and help save lives!
