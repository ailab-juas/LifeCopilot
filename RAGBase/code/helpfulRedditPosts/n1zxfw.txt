LPT: most men today are STARVED of emotional support. If you show them a bit of empathy and treat them like humans, they will return it 10 folds.

Life experience from a gay guy, I don’t like to play an identity card but I feel that it’s relevant to the topic.

Most of my friends who are straight men are absolutely starved of affection, respect and emotional support, you can’t even imagine how dire the situation is.

And I know this because a lot of these guys consider me a close friend that they’ll share problems they wouldn’t even do with their SO. 

All I do is show them the most basic form of empathy and support - I tell them they look good often. (Because hell, they are! All types of men are fucking beautiful in my gay eyes.) I listen to their problems, try to come up with solutions and I don’t judge or tell them they’re less of a man because they can’t solve it themselves. I’m not worried of crossing some imaginary boundary of ‘that’s gay’ because I already am. 

It’s really obvious to me - no matter how old these men are, they’re never too mature of a man to ask someone else for help. They might think they do, but I’m here to tell them that it’s ok to feel sad or vulnerable or frustrated with not living up to the standard of what a real man is. 

And the result of all of that is these men reward me with their trust and friendship, and as corny as this might sound, there really is a sense of accomplishment when you uplift someone’s spirit, at least that’s how I feel.

Treat your fellow men better, because you deserve it, and they do too.
