YSK 99% of the world's ladder firetrucks can't reacher higher than the 7th floor of a building.

Take this into consideration when choosing an apartment.
Most high-rise fires originate from the first four floors of the building, so evacuating from a high level internally can become more difficult.

-  invest in smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and a fire blanket (they also make very thoughtful housewarming gifts!)

-  empty your dryer lint after every load

-  don't store flammable items near your water heater (e.g. paint cans, cleaning products)

-  plan at least two escape routes that don't require an elevator

-  don't leave candles unattended

-  don't bbq/grill on a balcony/patio where the awning funnels the smoke directly into your home

-  don't put out kitchen fires with water
