LPT [Request] On How to Wake up Early without feeling Tired?

content:
I am definitely a night owl, but the past 1.5 years, I had to wake up for 9am work. I've had th luxury of waking up literally at 8:40am due to work from home, but I realize it won't be like that. You'd think after 1.5 years I'd have trained myself to not have difficulty waking up early anymore (i.e. before 9am) yet, I struggle and feel VERY tired still in the morning.

Any advice to help to make getting out of bed in the morning tolerable and not feeling sleeping/drowsy in the morning? (and don't say get a dog haha)
