LPT: If you want to play games on your phone without annoying ads, turn off mobile data.

content:
I noticed this when I was abroad.

Edit: it seems there are better ways to achieve this LPT, like removing internet acces for the app itself. Moreover, this doesn't work for all apps. 

However, as many phones have a quick and easy way to turn off connections (E.g. Airplane mode) it is a fast and simple way to do it. 

Edit 2: I realize that the ads are there for a reason, and I respect developers for creating games. I am mostly referring to intrusive ads like unskippable videos.
