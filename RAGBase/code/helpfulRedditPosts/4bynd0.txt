Crew members on film sets use this method for tasks like marking actors but there's no reason why you can't too whenever you need to tear tape from a roll. If the gif doesn't do it for you, [here's the source with more detailed instructions.](http://www.theblackandblue.com/2010/10/26/how-to-rip-and-tab-paper-tape-for-marking-tutorial-pics-video/)

Tabbing your tape this way makes it easier and cleaner to tear because you leverage against the sharp edge of the roll to tear. It also leaves a non-sticky folded triangular flap to save your place around the roll. When you tear a new piece, the triangular flap from the previous tear comes with the strip so if need to remove the tape from a flat surface later you can pull on the triangle instead of picking away with your nails. Of course, this also means the triangle can catch on things and rip the tape out so this isn't the best if you need to apply tape long term or very securely (shipping packages, etc.) You could also just tear off the triangle in those cases.

EDIT: I should've mentioned that this works best with tape that you can tear by hand normally (masking tape, paper tape, cloth tape, duct tape, painter's tape, etc.) It makes it easier but if the tape is difficult to tear by hand to begin with (electric tape, packaging tape) it won't magically be super easy all of a sudden.

EDIT 2: Of course, as some have mentioned, the trade off is that you waste a bit of tape with every piece for the triangle, especially if the roll is wide. If the roll is narrow the waste is more negligible.  It's up you you to decide whether or not the convenience is worth the waste, depending on what type of tape you have and how expensive it is.
