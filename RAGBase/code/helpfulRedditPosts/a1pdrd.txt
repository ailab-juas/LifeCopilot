YSK that if you cannot access abortion services for any reason, AidAccess.org will mail you the abortion pills for a donation amount of your choice.

So ladies if you’re in an area where abortion is banned or restricted, you aren’t out of options. [AidAccess.org](AidAccess.org) is run by physicians and women’s rights advocates who offer abortion services internationally to women who may not otherwise have access. This includes the USA where abortion is *heavily restricted* in some states and often very expensive. 

After a brief questionnaire, an advocate will mail a valid prescription, instructions, pills (plus some extras) and will even walk you through the steps if needed via SKYPE. The organization is based on donations, no minimum amount required. 

Edit: Im in Texas and I received the pills without leaving my home. I’m not pregnant but I want options should I ever need them. Stored unopened in the freezer, their shelf life will even outlast me, meaning the pills can be stored preemptively for peace of mind. However, please note that isn’t the org’s intent and please donate as much as you are able. Women’s reproductive rights are human rights. 

**AidAccess.org is directing all your donations to [Women on Web](https://www.womenonweb.org/en/donate) and [Women On Waves](https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/donate)
