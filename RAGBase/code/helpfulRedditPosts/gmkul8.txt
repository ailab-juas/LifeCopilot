LPT: Use smile.amazon.com instead of the regular site. It's the same exact thing, except they donate 0.5% of every eligible purchase price to a charity of your choosing.

content:
You just choose a charity and they donate with every eligible purchase you make. Been using it for a long time now and have donated quite a bit just by shopping like I normally would.

I'm not affiliated with Amazon in any way, just letting people know of an easy way to help their favorite charity.
