YSK to bring your pets into the vet hungry

Why YSK: 

Not only will a 6-hour fast help ensure more [accurate](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/preparing-your-pet-for-a-blood-test) bloodwork (should any be necessary), it will also make your pet more willing to take treats from us. 

Your veterinary team wants visits to be as [stress-free](https://fearfreepets.com/wp-content/uploads/delightful-downloads/2019/04/Practice-Certification-Standards-Summary-4.pdf) as possible. When your pet takes treats from us, it helps establish trust and comfort. This improves the overall quality of exam and helps reduce fear related to vet visits. 

If you know your pet is picky, feel free to bring in their favorite treat from home!

Finally off work and able to attempt this from a computer! 

This is advice for healthy dogs and cats! For pocket pets (rabbits, rats, etc), avians, or other pets with preexisting health conditions please consult your vet! Certain procedures might also require a long fast - your vet should let you know this. As always, your vet's advice and instructions supersedes anything written here. 

Some people are asking for my qualifications -- I'm a fear-free certified vet tech.

ETA2: 
To elaborate on my first edit, there are certain animals that you absolutely cannot withhold food from - rabbits being the most common. Unfortunately, the bulk of fear-free research and practice focuses on dogs and cats, so this advice applies only to them. 

If you think your pet is too stressed during a visit, next time ask your vet about previsit meds! They can function as a mild sedative or anxiolytic to help reduce stress during the visits. They're certainly not appropriate for every animal, but if your vet thinks your pet could benefit they tend to be very affordable and safe.
