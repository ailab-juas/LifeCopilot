LPT - if you find a service on Groupon (massage, laser removal, haircut, etc) instead of buying the Groupon deal call the business directly to get the same price.

One of my clients told me this hack and Iâ€™ve been living for it.Saw a Groupon deal for a package of laser hair removal, called the business that was doing it and asked for the Groupon price. They were more then happy to give it me because they get more money that way then paying a % to Groupon. You save money and the business saves money too!
