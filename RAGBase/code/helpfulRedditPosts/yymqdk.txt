title:
YSK most snow stakes are made of fiberglass

Why YSK: Most people know this, but if not, be careful of touching them with your bare hands as the fiberglass can get into your skin. It will itch and feel like annoying splinters so its best to just handle them with gloves.

EDIT: It seems like everyone has a different name for these things. Where i’m from we’ve always called them snow stakes (must be a weird Ohio thing). However, as many people have stated below, they are thin poles (usually neon orange) that you place in the ground to mark things like curbs, driveways etc. when it snows so you don’t hit anything when plowing.
