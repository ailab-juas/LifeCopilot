YSk buying a newish second hand car can give you less hastle than buying a new car

content:
Why YSK. The old saying is true, once you buy a new car, whenyou leave the dealership the car droppes by at a minimum of 20% of the cost price. Adding to this, a fault in a new car is drastically more hassle to get fixed because it needs to be refered to the manufacturer.

Granted warranty is in place you won't know for a few hundred miles of driving if you genuinely like it.

Buying a proven reliable car a couple of years old from a dealership still has a warranty and after a few weeks, if you don't like it, you can sell it on for much less of a loss

Edit: spelling mistake

Edit 2: I'm speaking about the situation in Ireland not USA.
