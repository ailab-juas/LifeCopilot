YSK that many sugar free candies use sugar alcohols as a sweetener, which have laxative properties in moderate amounts

content:
Sugar alcohols are commonly used as sweeteners in sugar free candies and gum. 

Most of these have highly pronounced laxative properties in moderate amounts. 

For example, I ate about 15 (they were really good) sugar free jolly ranchers in a sitting and I am currently glued to the toilet spewing out a large volume of liquid at high velocity . Learn from my mistake.

And before you think you can prank someone by putting the sugar free ones in regular wrappers, do understand that some people are extremely sensitive, if not completely intolerant of sugar alcohols and it can cause them to be hospitalized.
