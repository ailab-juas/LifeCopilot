LPT: Buy a Christmas tree ornament from the places you visit on vacation. Each year, when you decorate your tree, you’ll have a nice trip down memory lane as you are reminded of your travels.

I’ve been doing this for 20+ years now, and every year is a really nice treat.  Lots of fun memories, and a tree filled with really special ornaments.
