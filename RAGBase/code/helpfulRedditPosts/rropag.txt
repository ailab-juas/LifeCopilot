YSK if you enjoy cooking with lots of spices, local Asian/Indian/foreign grocery stores tend to have spices at much lower prices and at greater quantities than traditional grocers that only sell things like McCormick

content:
Why YSK: For $6 I got a large bottle of sesame seeds. The tiny bottle of McCormick is almost $4. The quantity difference might be over 50x the seeds for an extra 2 dollars. They also support local people better than your regional chain.

I used an entire bottle of cumin and other Indian spices for 1 recipe of butter chicken totalling $10-$15 in spices. The Indian store near me sold near gallon sized bags of it for less than $10.

If you like to cook, buy from them and then transfer extras into old glass jars for safe keeping since they don't usually come in resealable bags. It's a great way to save some money and try new fun products.

Edit: by "foreign" I mean anything non chain related in any US city. I'd assume it's the same internationally but cannot confirm.

Edit 2: many people are referencing the "cutting" of spices at stores like that to make them cheaper, I don't know enough about it to give thoughts. There's tests for it out there, Google it for your own knowledge and safety.
