LPT: Many cars are easier to fix than most people think. Step by step video tutorials can make fixing cars easy, even for those with ZERO experience. It’s a simple way to save thousands of dollars and can even serve as a hobby.

I grew up knowing NOTHING about cars. I always thought it was something you have to be taught growing up. Eventually I was broke enough where taking it to a shop wasn’t an option. Then I started looking videos up online and realized just how easy it is to work on cars. 

With only the help of the internet, I replace my brakes/rotors/oil regularly and have easily replaced alternators, fuel pumps, shocks, headlights, brake lights, various harnesses, etc. I have maybe $50 in tools and have saved thousands of dollars. Things take about 2-3 times longer to fix than if you took it to a shop, but you get faster the more your work on cars. I am now at the point where I don’t even need to lookup tutorials for most stuff.

Usually I don’t even know what the car part does until I lookup a video. It doesn’t matter though. Most things are simply time consuming to fix, but easy as hell. I also go to car junkyards to get cheap used parts. This also helps you know how to replace the part before you buy it by giving you practice. And it makes for a pretty good hobby for some people. If you struggle financially (or for some people, even if you don’t struggle), try fixing your car yourself and save thousands of dollars.
