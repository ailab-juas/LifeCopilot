LPT: When a friend is upset, ask them one simple question before saying anything else: 'Do you want to talk about it or do you want to be distracted from it?'

content:
This is honestly one of the best things you can do for an upset friend. I use it all the time and people respond very well to it. Sometimes people come to you because they need to vent. Comfort them first, then follow up with 'do you want advice or do you want me to just listen?'. But other times, they just need to let someone outside of the conflict know what happened, and then they want to talk about something else. Talk about your own day, show them the latest funny thing you saw, go do something fun together. This question sets boundaries and builds trust. It shows you can be there in any way they need.

edit: WOW! so many awards! thanks so much. im going about pming everyone to thank them. but heres a carrd link to BLM resources and a bunch of campaigns, charities, and black owned businesses you can donate to. it would mean so much to me as an ally of the BLM movement if you put a few dollars towards a campaign of your choice. sorry, im on mobile: https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/
