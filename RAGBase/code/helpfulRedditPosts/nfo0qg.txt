LPT: There is NO SHAME in practicing phone calls prior to making them. Speak it out loud, practice with a friend/partner/pet, DO WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO FEEL PREPARED. Plan out what you're going to say if you need to - feel free to rehearse. IT IS HELPFUL! Don't let anyone convince you otherwise!

Also good for (as y'all add more):

* Conversations/discussions with superiors, subordinates, and equals alike.
* Presentations (*although I personally hope you already practice those*)
* Making an order at a restaurant, drive-through, or in-person fast food
* When leaving a voice mail
* Before answering a phone call
