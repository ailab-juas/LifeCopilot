title:
YSK not to punish your kids for being honest to you.

content:
Why YSK: When I was younger, I would lie a lot, and getting into maturity around 13 years old I would stop lying altogether, only to find myself in more trouble. If I continued lying, I’d get into less trouble and it really does incubate and reward dishonestly.

Don’t let your kids off with everything, but don’t punish them for being honest. It’s a slap in the face and a step in the wrong direction.

Edit: stolen from u/stanselmdoc: 

"Thank you for being honest with me."

"I am happy when you're honest with me, because I want you to know you don't have to be afraid of telling me anything."

"If you're scared you'll get in trouble for telling me something, tell me you're scared. It will help me prepare for what you're going to say."

"I believe you and I take you seriously."

These are the phrases I live by as a Mom. If you teach kids that being honest is wrong, and having emotions is wrong, they will act out and lie, or worse something terrible may happen to them, and they'll shut down and never talk to you about it.
