YSK: People who complain about noise often have very good reasons.

content:
I am not saying to stop doing things you need to do if you are being noisy. However people often complain about how neighbors or roommates are easily upset by noise. There are a lot of good reasons however for them to get upset. They may work nights and are trying to sleep. Or they may have insomnia. Or they may be recovering from something or have a concussion or other medical condition that makes them sensitive to noise. Even if they are just a teenager; teenagers are biologically wired not to be able to go to bed early https://www.neurologylive.com/view/teenage-circadian-rhythm). Or they may work from home and have difficulty focusing.

Why YSK: People who complain about noise aren't just assholes. They usually have good reason. So please be polite and obey your city ordinance laws.

Edit: But also, if you have a noise complaint, calling the police is not always necessary if you haven't already talked to the people making the noise.
