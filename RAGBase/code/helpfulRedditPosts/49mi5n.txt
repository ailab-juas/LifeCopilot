LPT: To avoid children in movie theaters, go to the earliest or latest showing on weekdays.

content:
Realized this when I was watching Zootopia last night, but children have a mostly uniform and strict schedule where they can go to movies.  This is mostly at showings between 4pm-8pm on weekdays. 

If you really want to go to the newest Disney movie, but don't want to wade through crowds of screaming kids, go during school hours.  Most theaters start showing these movies at at least 1pm.  Already have a 9-5 job?  Try to go at the latest showing.  The showing I went to started at 10pm and was over by around 12am, which is long past the time most sane parents would keep their kids up.

Just a quick tip for people who have been burned one too many times on bratty kids at movie theaters.

edit:  A lot of people have said the early showings would be full of kids younger than kindergarten, so later shows would be preferred.

I've also seen a lot of suggestions for dine-in movie theaters that don't allow people under a certain age, which would obviously be preferred if you have one in the area, but my area only has the traditional movie theaters.
