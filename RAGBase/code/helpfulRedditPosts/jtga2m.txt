title:
LPT: if you have school-aged kids, write the names of your kid’s classmates in the back of the class picture. You can always use that as a reference when your child talks about what happens in class, and it will also be helpful years later when memories get fuzzier and names get forgotten

content:
I was looking at my own old class pictures from way back (i’m 38), and can barely remember the names of a third of the kids in my 6th grade picture. Maybe I don’t remember some of them, maybe I don’t recognize some others, and I find that a bit sad.

And now my oldest is in school, and she talks about her friends she made there, and I can’t wait for the class picture so I can put a face on those names

EDIT: Ok, some of you guys have year books every year, presumably from kindergarten all the way to high school graduation. Apparently it's a thing, and that's awesome, but I'd imagine this is the exception rather than the norm.
