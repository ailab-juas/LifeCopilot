LPT: If you are not currently exercising: do a round of burpees when you wake up and when you go to bed. Do as many as you can. It DOES NOT have to be many. You will notice within days that you are more alert and in a good mood.

 About a month ago I complained that I was always tired when I came home from work, and a colleague suggested this. The first day, I could only do three burpees at morning and 5 at night, the second day was pretty much the same. Only after a week was I able to do 7 in a row, but boy did I feel better overall in terms of clarity of mind and I was less tired coming home from work.
