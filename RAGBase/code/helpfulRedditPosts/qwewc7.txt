LPT: Older people ask about you/your wife having kids because they are trying to bond with you, not because they want to be nosy, so cut them some slack.

content:
Both my parents have 7 siblings. My wife's mother has 7 siblings. People had more kids back in the day for many reasons - the point is, having a large family like that was normal for tons of people in the 1950s-60s. When older people at family reunions ask you/your wife or even GF when you are going to get married and start a family, it is not because they are judging you, it is because that is what they did.

I know so many people who have a vitriolic reaction to being asked this - I do understand that reaction, as it is a very personal question. It isn't really anyone's business. But for the most part, people mean well when they ask this question.

Edit: Kind of amusing, I got a bunch of awards that I dont know what to do with and upvotes, but so many of the comments are basically harsh disagreements or justifications for being shitty to people who ask about babies and thats kinda funny
