LPT: Before hiking, download a free U.S. Geological Survey topographic map of the area you are hiking in and print a copy

content:
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has been producing detailed topographic maps for more than 125 years. Today they are nearly all digitized and free to download through the [USGS Map Store](http://store.usgs.gov/).

Also, smart phones get dropped, get wet, or sometimes just die on you. Don't rely on a smart phone. Bring a map as well. Print one out and put it in a ziplock bag (and leave a copy with your planned route marked in your car at the trailhead) or buy a high-quality waterproof topo map.
