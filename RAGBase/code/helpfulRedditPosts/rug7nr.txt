LPT: Wake up an hour earlier in the morning and spend 30 minutes on your body and 30 minutes on your mind. Every day you will feel like you've accomplished something, even if you have a bad day.

content:
I chose to do yoga for 30 minutes, and study German for 30 minutes using an online course.

KEY: Whatever you choose for your body, don't exhaust yourself with it. Do something that leaves you feeling refreshed and relaxed so that you are eager to do it again the next morning.

I took a few yoga classes and watched a few videos to figure out poses that would improve my flexibility and strengthen my back and core. When I started, doing a simple standing bend I could barely get my hands past my knees, and now I can almost get my palms flat to the floor. I learned to focus on my breathing, and stretch into the pose and not strain. When I started, I could hold a plank for barely fifteen seconds, now I can easily plank for three minutes.

For your mind, it can be anything. Reading, doing puzzles, taking an online course in something that interests you. I started learning German because I had always been interested in the language but never spent much time on it. My job as a design manager requires me to think visually much of the time, and studying a language every morning makes my brain work differently.

Four years later, I've finished the German course (but keep reviewing it), I'm learning Spanish, and reviewing the French I took in high school and college.

EDIT: 

1. WOW. So. Many. Crankypants. Yes, PLEASE stay in bed.

2. The language course I use is Duolingo - the website, not the mobile app. Very easy to use.

3. I got most of my yoga poses from https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/

4. Doing this genuinely changed my life for the better.
