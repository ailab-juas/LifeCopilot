YSK How to get a dog to release its bite

content:
Why YSK: Dog attacks are dangerous and there have been a lot of "Dog attack" videos on reddit lately that demonstrate the wrong thing to do if your dog attacks and bites someone or another dog and refuses to let go. I am no expert, and I am sure there is more advice in the comments so please check there as well. (but keep your grains of salt handy). 

The best thing you can do to get a dog to release its bite (edit: assuming it is biting something other than you) is to grab both its back legs and lift them into the air. This should be a significant lift, above the level of the dogs head, which forces it to balance on its front legs. Most dogs will release their bite when this happens as they are now off balance. This also prevents the dog from being able to pull and tear at their victim and puts you in a safe position from being bitten.

Once the dog has released, swing their body to force them onto their back. Keep their legs in the air so they cannot get up and hold tightly until they calm down or until their owner can get control of them.

Being in this position is unpleasant for the dog, but it breaks them out of the adrenaline- and aggression-fueled state of mind that caused them to attack. It also protects you from being bitten.

Grabbing the dogs collar and pulling it or smacking it will not help. Pulling the dog or the victim away causes more damage. Panicking and yelling will make an aggressive dog more aggressive. Act on the aggressive dog only, as they are the one that needs to be stopped
