YSK: If you're an avid smoker and you develop a sudden distaste for cigarettes, you may be coming down with acute liver disease

content:
If you suddenly lose all desire to smoke and you think it's too good to be true, it probably is. A common symptom of acute hepatitis is an aversion to tobacco in smokers.

This may come with other obvious symptoms such as fever or headaches, but a tell-tale sign is the inexplicable avoidance of tobacco or even alcohol or caffeine.
