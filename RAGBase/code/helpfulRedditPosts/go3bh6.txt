LPT you don’t always have to have a logical reason for saying “No.” “I’m not comfortable with that” is a really good reason.

I have a hard time saying no, and today I was asked to use my personal social media for work purposes. ex. Sharing communications to social media groups. 

The only times that I can comfortably say “no” is when I have a solid reason. I do not have the access... or I will be in a mandatory meeting at that time... 

But I had no reason other than I was very uncomfortable with it. So I politely told them that. They said okay, and we continued business as usual. 

I know that this LPT is not profound but it surprised me that it worked. I hope that it helps others by me sharing.
