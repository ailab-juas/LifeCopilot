title:
YSK tomorrow is free comic book day!

content:
Saturday the 7th is free comic book day. It's held on the first Saturday of May every year and encourages people to visit their local comic shops, pick up some free comics, and maybe buy a couple as well. 

I've gone the past few years and it's always a fun, friendly atmosphere for comic book lovers to discover new comics, meet new people, and enjoy the Spring weather.
