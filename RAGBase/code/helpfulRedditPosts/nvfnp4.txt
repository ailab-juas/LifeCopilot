LPT: When you don't have all the facts, try to give people the most generous reason you can for their behaviour. Annoyingly slow driver? Maybe it's a mom with a birthday cake in the back. This mindset will gradually make you less reactive, more compassionate and more forgiving of your own bad days.

Edit: thank you for all sharing your tips (didn't realise "they must need to poop" was such a common assumption!), awards and stories of how you do this in your own life. You're all fucking awesome, have a beautiful day and take all these good vibes out with you into the real world and spread them around! ðŸŒ»
