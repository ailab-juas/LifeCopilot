LPT: If you're a new parent, expose your kid to swimming EARLY. Get your kid in a pool to swim as an infant and try to do it as regularly as possible.

Why it matters: 

1) Early exposure will help them not be afraid of the water when it comes time to **learn to swim** as they age.


2) I'm at my daughter's swim practice right now and there is a 6 year old **freaking the fuck out** in the pool and her young parents are shocked, and just told the group of adults this is the first time they've taken her to a pool.  I've seen this happen a few times.  The parents are always embarrassed and the kids almost never come back here.

Edit: The parents pulled her from the class and took her home.  Damn.
