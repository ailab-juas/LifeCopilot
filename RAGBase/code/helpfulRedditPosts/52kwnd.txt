LPT: If you lose your ring in the ocean (or anywhere) like I did, there is a national directory of people who will help you find it free of charge, and they found mine!

content:
As a newlywed dummy, I went in the ocean with my wedding band on, and immediately got hit by a wave which pulled it right off.  Hugely disappointed but found out via a helpful email from craigslist about the TheRingFinders.  After calling and explaining my situation he showed up in 15 minutes, and found my ring in less than an hour in about a foot of water off shore (the tide had gone out at this point).  He didn't ask for any money and refused my attempts to repay him monetarily, just asked that we spread the word about their service.

Edit 2: I emailed him to apologize for crashing their site, which is TheRingFinders.com. ~~Here's a screencap of the story for reference which ill delete once their site is loading~~

Edit 3: I've been asked to put a shout out to /r/metaldetecting in here, who also are helpful people and some of the ringfinders hang out there

Edit 4: I am in no way associated with this site or the specific finder. My experience is limited to this one amazing individual, YMMV
