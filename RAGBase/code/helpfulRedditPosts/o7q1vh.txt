YSK: You NEED (not should) to consider your financial well being before adopting an animal.

Why YSK: Animals are very expensive (and time consuming) to have if you want to PROPERLY take care of them. Of course, there are some outliers when it comes to this.

Veterinary care is expensive and can break you if you’re wallet isn’t ready for it. Look into insurance costs, what they cover, deductible and any other hoops they may have you jump through to get an animal insured. That small monthly cost may save you a few thousand and the stress of trying to come up with it if you don’t already have it. Also, check with vet offices in your area to see what insurance they will approve (and their reviews if you’re wanting quality care). Some vet offices even have financial assistance programs for animals to get the care they need while also relieving financial burden from the owner.
