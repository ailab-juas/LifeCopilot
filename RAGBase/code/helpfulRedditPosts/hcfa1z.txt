YSK that abortion is available online, if your laws prohibit it, or if you feel unsafe getting an abortion in public.

content:
First of all, women shouldn't feel ashamed, or in danger when getting an abortion, but people are willing to label it as murder, and will treat it as such.

**If none of the above sites are available within time, and you live in the US, with the exception of 2 states, there is another, option available in your country. Misoprostol**  I am not too informed on this method, so I recommend you do your research on them. I cannot find the 2 states claimed to not condemn this drug either, but I am very bad at searching for states for laws this specific. Do your research on misoprostol if this is your final option, please, and consult a professional on how it may affect you.

**Important Edit:** I just realized that there **might** be limited accessibility during a pandemic. I apologize to those countries that might be restricted from this service.

#**If you cannot access abortion services for any reason, AidAccess.org will mail you the abortion pills for a donation amount of your choice.**

If you’re in an area where abortion is banned or restricted, you aren’t out of options. AidAccess is run by physicians and women’s rights advocates who offer abortion services internationally to women who may not otherwise have access. This includes the USA where abortion is heavily restricted in some states and often very expensive.

After a brief questionnaire, an advocate will mail a valid prescription, instructions, pills (plus some extras) and will even walk you through the steps if needed via SKYPE. The organization is based on donations, no minimum amount required.” 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that the user whom shared me this information encouraged this to get reposted, so I encourage you all to post this wherever it is relevant, **as recently another US state banned abortion, even if it involves incest, rape, and/or birth defects.**
