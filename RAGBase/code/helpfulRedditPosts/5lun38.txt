YSK: Why a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one.

content:
Sharp knives and dull knives damage in different ways and which is ultimately safer for you depends on a number of different factors. Sharp knives damage from poor knife handling skills, leading the knife to go not where the cook intended, leading to knicks and slices. The more inexperienced you are, the faster you are working and the less attention you are paying, the more likely this is to occur.

Dull knives injure when resistance suddenly gives way, leading to large pent up energies accelerating the knife into flesh, leading to deep cuts and gouges. This occurs, largely independent of the knife skills of the cook.

More importantly, knife injuries occur far more frequently when knife sharpness changes dramatically as established muscle pathways are no longer valid. You should take extra care when cutting with a newly sharpened knife as this is a very common source of kitchen injuries.

For cooks who do everything "by the book", a sharp knife is dramatically safer than a dull knife. For cooks familiar with cutting with sharp knives, sharp knives are also safer as the muscle pathways have been established. Cooks who are only used to dull knives will frequently injure or nearly injure themselves early on when handling sharp knives but, subsequently, with good technique, sharp knives will be safe.
