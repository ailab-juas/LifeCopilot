YSK: BlueLab is closing down and all their VSTs are now free

Why YSK: Finding high quality VSTs can be a pain for producers, especially ones that donâ€™t break the bank.

BlueLab is shutting down and all their VSTs are free until the site closes down. This is a great opportunity for producers to jump in and get some high quality VSTs for no charge at all.

Edit:
Thank you, u/TheWorldInMySilence for posting the definition in the comments when I forgot to add it to my post. To quote them:

"Virtual Studio Technology (VST) is an audio plug-in software interface that integrates software synthesizers and effects units into digital audio workstations. VST and similar technologies use digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware in software."
