LPT: Shower paneling from a hardware store is functionally identical to whiteboard, and is much cheaper

Whiteboards are expensive, but they don't have to be. [Here is a white hardboard panel from Home Depot for $10](http://www.homedepot.com/p/1-8-in-x-48-in-x-8-ft-Eucalyptus-White-Hardboard-447562/204727075)

That's a 4'x8' board for much cheaper than even the smaller whiteboards. I've used this myself (well, not from home depot) and love the results. I've put one up right inside my entrance, and one in my office. If you buy a few of them, you could easily create an entire wall of dry-erase board.

The only cons are that it's quite large and heavy, so some cutting may be required. The good part is that cutting this gives you two or more dry erase boards.
