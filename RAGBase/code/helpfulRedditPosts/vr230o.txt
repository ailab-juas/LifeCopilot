LPT: no one cares about your firework videos but if you turn the camera around and film your loved ones reaction you'll cherish the video forever.

content:
I've got young kids and my friends and family couldn't get enough of the videos of my kids seeing fireworks for the first time even years after the fact I've gone back and looked at them. Every video I've ever taken of fireworks has gotten old a day afterwards, but watching their little faces light up never goes bad. Don't have kids, do it of your significant other, your grandma, your wife whatever. It's always better than grainy dark handheld videos of fireworks no one cares about.
