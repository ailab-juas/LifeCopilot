YSK: To not attempt to store fuel in non approved containers.

content:
Why YSK:. I have witnessed people at pumps right now getting fuel in fuel cans before the price goes up.  One guy had 8-10 5 gallon cans in the back of his truck.  This reminded me of videos and pictures on the last scare of people putting fuel into all sorts of containers.

Just the act in itself is dangerous, a spark, or a bad reaction between gasoline and the item you are putting it into can be dangerous, or break down as it was not meant to store fuel.  Eg.  Styrofoam coolers

Not only this, but the more everyone gorges the pump trying to save a few cents...  The more demand goes up..  the more it drives the price when you need to resupply.  I feel this is even more reason to not attempt to store 100 gallons of extra gasoline in gas cans.  You and everyone else Will pay more when that runs out.
