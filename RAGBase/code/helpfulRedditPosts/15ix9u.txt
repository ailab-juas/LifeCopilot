LPT: If you get stuck in the snow while driving, use your floor mats

content:
Stop. Don't just accelerate, you'll dig a deeper hole. Instead, pull out your floor mat and place it in front of the spinning tire, tucking it in tightly. SLOWLY inch forward and you will be out of the ditch in no time.

Edit: Yes, there are a thousand and one other, better ways. This is if you're stuck and unprepared. The 'pro' part is using something you have with you at a time of an emergency.

Edit 2: Apparently this was in yesterday's thread about winter driving that I did not read. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/15htdg/lpt_how_to_win_at_winter_driving/c7mnf37) is the original comment. Go upvote this guy for karma.
