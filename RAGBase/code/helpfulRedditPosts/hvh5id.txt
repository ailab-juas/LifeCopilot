LPT: Whenever I buy a car privately, I make sure to call/text first to screen the seller over the phone with two questions. I ask if the person selling the car if their name on the title. Then, I ask if they would be willing to let me have the car professionally inspected (at my expense of course).

content:
1. If that person says "No, it's my cousin's car. I'm selling it for them." I know to avoid the trip. In my experience, it's much easier for people to lie to you if they were not the last owner of the car.
2. And for my second question, I ask them if they would be willing to drive the car to a mechanic near them for a full inspection. If the person starts waffling on such a request, I know not to go either.
