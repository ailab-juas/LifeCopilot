YSK what to do if your wallet is stolen while on travel that involves a return flight

content:

Here are a few things I've learned: 

* File a police report. Even though I was in Chicago (yeah... I'm sure Chicago PD would get right on tracking down the perps), not only does your credit card company like one, when you try to board your flight without your ID they want to see the police report.

* One form of "ID" when trying to get through TSA without a valid ID can be prescription medicine. I didn't know that, I'd already checked it into baggage.

* You can fly without an ID, they're just going to make you answer a bunch of questions proving your identity, and give your stuff (and "your stuff") a thorough examination.  I'd get there an hour earlier than you otherwise would have.

* If you have some other sort of photo ID, drop it into your toiletry bag. Even if it's something lame, might help.

* Your phone DOESN'T prove your identity at all. Doesn't matter that I have years and years of social media pictures, they have no interest in that.

* Your bank may be able to hand you a temporary ATM card. BofA did, very handy.


If you're curious what happened, I got set up while on the L in Chicago. One guy pretended to get his foot stuck in between the car and the platform, another guy grabbed the wallet.
