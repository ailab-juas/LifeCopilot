LPT: if you are bothered by wasps or bees building nests or swarming around your house / deck, stuff a brown paper lunch bag (or bags) and hang them up near where they congregate. They will think a rival hive has been established and leave within a few days!

I was super-skeptical that this would work when I first heard about it, but when we moved into our new house there were DOZENS of wasps constantly buzzing around our deck and I figured it was worth a try.

I took a couple brown paper lunch bags and stuffed them with crumpled newspaper so that they'd resemble paper wasp / bee nests, and hung them from the corners of the overhang of our deck. 

I was shocked to see that within a couple days, the wasps had moved on. We occasionally get maybe one or two flying by per week in the summer, but really no attempts to build nests. It is a definite and remarkable reduction. Amazing.
