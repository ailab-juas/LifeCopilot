YSK: You’d be very surprised how long a new coat of paint goes, but you’d be more surprised how long a wet rag goes before painting.

Why ysk. I work for a painting company and it always amazes me how insanely different a room looks with a fresh coat of paint. However, there are times where we get to a job and wipe everything down first and you can clearly see paint is not always necessary. Unless you specifically wanted a new color.
