LPT: Never underestimate the power of a stoic blank stare in confrontations. It's easy to engage and retort but giving absolutely nothing cuts deep. It's the kryptonite to crazy. You deploy that and people will either tire themselves out or realize they are overreacting real quick and retreat.

Edit: GUYS[!](https://youtu.be/aS4w0Y1Kif4) If the situation calls for an explanation and/or cooperation then ***of course*** you should fix it with dialogue.

Also if you are being threatened by an increasingly maddening individual then you should remove yourself from the situation.

Nothing applies to everything.

Edit 2: Yes, I'm advocating you do this every single time. Always. Every time till the end of times. You should never use discretion and only use this incredibly specific advice applicable to certain general situations. I have yet to hear from anyone disproving or disavowing it. Do this and only this. Forget everything else. This is the only way.
