title:
YSK that gambling online can prevent you from getting loans &amp; mortgages from the bank in the future

content:
Me and my friends were not aware of this when we were younger, and for those of us who have continued to gamble online in our adult years (even just the occasional bet); we are now finding it incredibly difficult to get access to loans and mortgages.  

Even those of us who have good jobs and no debt, our applications have been declined thanks to the online gambling transactions. 

You should be aware of this. We werenâ€™t.
