LPT: Write down a short 3-4 minute long introduction of yourself and memorize it - this way if you are introduced and have to "tell a little about yourself" you will sound a lot more confident.

content:
Sometimes I find myself at a business convention or even just around the office and someone will introduce me to somebody important (higher management, important customer, government official, etc.) and then comes the part of the conversation where I'm supposed to talk about who I am and what I do.

Your first impression will be significantly better if you nail this introduction - and if you have a canned speech prepared for this scenario you will be amazed at how confident you come across. 




**EDIT:** The consensus seems to be 3-4 minutes is way too long - aim for 30 seconds or so. 

My reasoning behind "preparing" a 3-4 minute long introduction is I can use the entirety of the prepared speech if I have to give a presentation, or I could pick and choose the relevant parts for when I meet people.
