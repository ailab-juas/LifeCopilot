title:
YSK: Excedrin Migraine is exactly the same medication as Excedrin Extra-strength. The latter is less expensive

content:
The only difference between the two is the insert that describes how to take the medication to treat a migraine.  
Why YSK: youâ€™ll save money buying the extra strength version, or you can treat your migraine with the extra strength version if the migraine is sold out
