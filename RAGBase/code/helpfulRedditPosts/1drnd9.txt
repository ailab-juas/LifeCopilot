LPT Target now price matches Amazon, great way to save money and get it immediately

content:
Target will price match other web sites (like best buy) and they also price match Amazon which I do not think anyone else does.
The item does have to be sold and shipped by Amazon, so no 3rd parties, but the employees might let you slide. You can also get the addition 5% off with the RedCard if you have one. This is great because you get the cheaper price, don't have to wait to get your item, and don't have to pay shipping. I'm going to be doing this a lot now that I know about it.

Note: I got God of War Ascension retail: 59.99, for $50.34 after tax.

tl;dr get amazon prices, immediately, possibly cheaper
