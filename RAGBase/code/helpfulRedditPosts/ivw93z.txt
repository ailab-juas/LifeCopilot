YSK to double check your vehicle after a break in, or else your insurance company might rip you off.

Why YSK? I was broken into last year while at a park. I'd been gone only 15 minutes and when I returned my windshield had a huge crack in it and my passenger window was smashed. I had several valuable things stolen, and a hole kicked into my fender/bumper (sorry not good with cars in any way, shape, or form except driving haha). When the police arrived and I made my report, I was still pretty panicked and I left out the hole in the bumper because I simply hadn't thought to look there. Who would look there with two smashed windows at eye level? The next day when I made the report to my insurance company, I had noticed the hole in my bumper and added that on, thinking nothing of it. The insurance company refused to cover it. The hole wasn't on the police report, so it "is impossible to prove that it happened during the break in". Honestly it was pretty upsetting, seeing as the fender cost more than the windows to replace, but I learned to always, always double check before making a police report or else you might get ripped off.

Edit: after the comment about how it isn't really getting ripped off, I would agree, so maybe change the word "ripped off" to whatever you feel is more appropriate haha

Edit 2: ok I did not expect this to gain this sort of traction haha. I like all the discussions down below and appreciate the advice from people in the business. 

Final Edit: alright honestly me trying to cover people's asses for them has upset some people. I apologize for being so cautious. I'm removing all the gender stuff because this post was about insurance issues and not gender, and will not be answering, I apologize again.
