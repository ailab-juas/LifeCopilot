YSK all the things dogs and cats cannot eat.

content:
If your dogs are fuzzy vacuum cleaners like mine is, then you should probably make sure you know what to keep them away from. And if you have a cats... well I'm not quite sure why you would have a cat instead of a dog, but you probably still shouldn't poison them. 

Here's the list of foods that can make your pets ill. Some of them can be fatal: 

* Chocolate-- fast heart rate, hallucinations, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death

* Ethanol (Alcohol)-- animals are generally more susceptible to alcohol than humans are. The caveats here are similar to alcohol poisoning in humans. 

* Raw yeast dough--  intestinal obstruction and/or ethanol poisoning 

* Hops (beer hops) Edit: the plant, not necessarily beer itself. --  malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results

* Avocados-- possible damage to the heart muscle cells, leading to heart failure

* Grapes/raisins-- acute kidney failure

* Macadamia nuts-- non-fatal stiffness, tremors, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain

* Onions, garlic, shallots, etc.--  hemolytic anemia

* Xylitol (sweetner found in gum and other sugar-free things)-- toxic or even fatal liver damage

* Moldy or rotten food-- some molds produce toxins called tremorgenic mycotoxins, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems if ingested by dogs.

* Raw meats and raw eggs-- Salmonella and E. coli can be bad. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems.

* Salt-- Large amounts of salt can produce excessive thirst and urination, or even sodium ion poisoning in pets; vomiting, diarrhea, depression, tremors, elevated body temperature, seizures and even death.

* Milk-- mammals are naturally lactose intolerant 

* Bones-- choking hazard; splintering can cause damage to soft tissues.

Edit:

Because a lot of people are unhappy about the raw meat/bones, it should probably be clarified that a lot of raw meat isn't really healthy for your dogs/cats, especially if they aren't used to it. So if you're pet has been eating 3 pounds of raw meat every day for the past 8 years, you're probably safe; if your pet's food is primarily pet food, then you should probably be careful. 

And about the bones, I know for a fact that bones can splinter and lodge in soft tissues internally. Chicken bones are the worst in my experience, though beef and pork have never made my animals sick. 

Edit 2: ffs, feed your dogs all the raw meat you want. See if I care!

Edit 3: to be more correct, mammals are lactose intolerant outside of their infancy
