LPT: Don't announce a death on the internet unless you are 100% sure all family members &amp; close friends have been told in person, or at-least on the phone

And no, FB Messenger doesn't count either.

I found out my nan (grandmother) had died through a social media channel, and it was horrid. It took a while for me to compute how learning the news in this way screwed me over, which I wrote about it [here](http://leelum.com/blog/deathsocialmediaandme/). But in Short:

There is a whole list of reasons why finding out such news on the internet is horrid. But for starters there’s no controlling what state of mind recipient of said news is currently in, you can’t personalise the news to them, you leave them in the position of being in an empty elevator, walking down the street, or already stressed working on a deadline, only to learn that someone they cared for has died. Worst of all, you could be telling this person without the knowledge they will have the emotional support already around them. You’re telling someone life changing horrid news, throwing them down a well, and letting them fester on it. And that sucks.
