LPT: Keep your dog leashed in public at all times no matter how well trained you think he/she is.

content:
Seeing lots of dogs walking off leash in public parks now that dedicated dog areas are locked up during the lockdown. Some look like new owners with new puppies.

Not everyone likes dogs. Some are allergic. Some are deathly scared. Dogs can also react to sudden unexpected movements in surprising ways. Even if you lose your grip on a leash, it's easier to catch a leash than the unleashed dog. 

Keep your dog on a leash at all times in public. For everyone's safety, including your and other dogs.

Edit: lots of great comments below. Some awful stories about off leash dogs. Wanted to address a few points that have come up in the discussion:

For those confident in their dog's training, a leash is most likely to save your dog's life, not anyone else's. Your dog is more predictable to you but you have no idea how other dogs or people will react. With a leash you can get them out of any dangerous situation.

A leash is not a replacement for training or socialization, it's more like a safety. Train and socialize your dog. And that never stops. If your dog can't walk on a loose leash it's because it wasn't trained to do so.

Exercise for high energy breeds. There's a reason high energy breeds are only recommended for people with high energy lifestyle people. Use 30ft or 50ft leads to train recall. Train your dog to run along side you. Go out to remote hiking trails. Running around in your local public park isn't nearly enough.

And retractable leashes are terrible. They teach the dog to pull, and you can get some nasty injuries if they get caught in your dog or your leg.
