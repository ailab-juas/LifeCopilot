LPT: Instead of asking for someone's number, just give them yours and tell them you'd love to hear from them it will avoid any awkwardness in case the feeling isn't mutual

Either you'll hear from them or you won't, but it avoids someone having to say no or giving a fake number cause they don't feel like they can say no
