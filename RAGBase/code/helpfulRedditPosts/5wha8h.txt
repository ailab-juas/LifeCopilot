YSK that it's usually much cheaper to refill propane tanks than to exchange them.

content:
Your standard propane tank that you use on a gas grill has a 20 pound capacity (about 4.7 gallons). Big box stores like Home Depot and Lowes have exchange programs where you drop off an empty tank in exchange for a "full" one. YSK that they're only filling them to 75% capacity, 15lbs (about 3.5 gallons).

It's $19.97 at my local Home Depot to exchange for 15lbs of propane. It's $2.29 gallon to refill at my local Tractor Supply, or $8 for the same amount. I can get a full 20lbs for about $11.
