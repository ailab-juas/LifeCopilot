LPT: If you own a home, give it a quick "walk-around" every single day

content:
I'm a claims assessor for a home insurance company. Today I visited a house after the homeowner filed a claim for storm and rodent damage. This guy has a nice 2 story 3 bedroom home where he uses the upstairs bedroom as a storage room, and keeps the door to that room shut. That bedroom is around the rear, and he says he rarely goes into the back yard except to mow it. On Wednesday he went to cut his grass and while he was out back, he noticed a hole in his roof, which wasn't there the last time he cut his grass ten days prior.

To make a long story short, turns out his house was struck by lightning 8 days before the discovery, resulting in a small fire and a 6 inch hole straight through the roof. At some point his upstairs bedroom was visited by squirrels and/or roof rats. The room and its contents suffered water damage, boxes had been gnawed open, clothing and other possessions were ruined, and there was evidence of chewing around an electrical outlet which could have led to a catastrophic fire.

Because the homeowner rarely goes into his backyard or enters the upstairs bedroom, he didn't notice anything was wrong for A WHOLE WEEK! If he'd caught this the day it happened, most of the water damage could have been mitigated, all of the rodent damage prevented, and most of the damaged belongings would have been saved. Your insurance company can dispatch a service to handle an emergency like this 24/7, but you have to notice it first.

Take one minute each day to walk around the outside of your home looking for anything out of place. Take another minute to visit each room inside your house and give it a once over. You can save yourself a much bigger headache later on!
