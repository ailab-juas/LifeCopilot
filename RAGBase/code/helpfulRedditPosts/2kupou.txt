LPT: Once you have a child, create an email for them. Write them an email as often as you like as they age.

content:
I started this after I had my second Daughter. I write to her as though she will be an adult when she reads it. I like to share little stories that I think they will enjoy when they get older (like how she got that scar on her chin) that I might forget along the way. I heard/read it somewhere and I thought it was a cool idea, thought id share. Apologies if it has been suggested before. 


Edit: Thank you for the gold. I feel bad as this is not my original idea, only passing it on. Thanks for the generosity.
