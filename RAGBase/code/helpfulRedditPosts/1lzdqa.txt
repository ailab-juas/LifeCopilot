LPT: Have a separate account on your laptop for performing presentations

content:
Recently I've been giving a lot of presentations for school, work, and other stuff I do on the side. Often, other people use my computer during these presentations. I only have one personal laptop, however, which I use for almost everything, so the UI is heavily customized, fairly unprofessional, and super messy. (Rotating backgrounds, custom key and trackpad shortcuts, stuff all over the desktop, etc.)

Rather than worry about cleaning up or adjusting stuff every time I do something more formal, I created a second account on my computer. I leave everything in this account at the default settings, and switch over to it when I give presentations. The benefits are twofold. First, it isn't embarrassing to plug my computer into a projector, and second, other people can use my computer without getting confused by my customized controls.
