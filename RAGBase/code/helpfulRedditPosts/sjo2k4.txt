LPT: If you can't afford the vet, you can't afford the pet.

content:
When considering pet ownership, be aware that at some point in the animal's life, there's a good chance the animal will have an unexpected medical emergency that will cost you several hundred to several thousand dollars, in addition to the cost of annual checkups, grooming, and vaccinations. If you aren't able to budget for that eventuality, don't get the pet.

Edit: This does not mean you can't be a good pet owner unless you are rich. Pets can cost a lot of money, often in unexpected ways. Account for that in your decision to get one. It is a terrible feeling to be in the position of choosing between paying the bills or letting a beloved member of your family die of a treatable issue.

And if you can't afford basic vet care, you shouldn't have a pet. It is 100% dependent on you for it's medical needs, and as it's owner you have an obligation to take care of the animal's health, just as you have an obligation to feed it and give it a loving environment.
