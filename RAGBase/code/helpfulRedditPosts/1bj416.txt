title:
LPT: Making a left turn? Do not turn your front wheels until you set your car in motion. If rear-ended you could get pushed into oncoming traffic in the other lane.

Hope the title made sense...English is not my first language so bear with me. So...You come to a stop on a street and need to do a left turn. You wait for oncoming traffic. Do not turn your front wheels until you set your car in motion. If rear-ended you could get pushed into oncoming traffic in the other lane. Be safe...

EDIT: Common sense or not...I got this from a rescue worker...he sees it all the time. People are sitting in their cars waiting for traffic in the opposite lane to cease, gets rear-ended and gets pushed into the other lane. Also...I now see the tip was posted before some time ago. For what it's worth, I can honestly say I hadn't seen it.
