title:
YSK that "light" "diet" and "kids" versions of juice are a major ripoff

content:
Why ysk: the low sugar versions of juice are just watered down with vitamin c and sweetener added for flavor. You can just add water to a glass of juice, achieve the same effect, and even extend your value from regular juice.

Though watered down OJ tastes bad, the rest are about the same as long as you don't water it down too much.

Edit: good to see some well thought out and informed comments. Seems like I always learn something reading good comment threads on this site.
