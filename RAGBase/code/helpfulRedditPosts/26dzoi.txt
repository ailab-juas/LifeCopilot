LPT: Every month try a new hobby, by the end of the year you will notice that you're spending more time doing productive work and improving yourself.

Last year I decided to try new hobbies every month, I started by painting and drawing, and a month later I was spending more time doing it than watching tv or waste time on the internet.
I continued discovering new hobbies, and by the end of the year I was painting, read, writing, I speak a new language, and doing a lot more activities that helped me improve myself. I'm now completely different from the man I was a year ago.

If the hobby is not interesting or I don't enjoy doing it, I stop doing it, and start a new one.

Honestly it was the best dicision I've ever made, It helped me become happier and Give something back to the world.
I now spend a significantly less time watching tv or browsing the internet.
