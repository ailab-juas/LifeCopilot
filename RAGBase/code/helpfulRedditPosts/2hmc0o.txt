LPT: Try doing pushups or your physical equivalent as soon as you jump out of bed.

content:
Doing so provides your body the jolt it needs to be up and fully awake earlier in the morning, so you don't struggle to leave the house. It works better than coffee in the short-term because caffeine takes 15-20 minutes to get into gear. Pushups have no crash afterwards either.

(Plus, as a bonus, you get some physical activity in.)
