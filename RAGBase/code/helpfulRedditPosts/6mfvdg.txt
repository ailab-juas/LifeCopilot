title:
LPT - When you're about to cry, think of words that rhyme or count backwards from 100 in sevens. Engaging the logic part of your brain shifts bloodflow away from your emotional centers and helps you maintain your composure.

I read this in the book "Moody Bitches" by Julie Holland, if that's relevant. 

Edit: I absolutely support people expressing emotion in healthy ways, and I encourage all people to cry when they need to, in whatever context. That's up to an individual person to decide. I just wanted to clarify that this advice is directed at people who have made the decision to hold off on crying until another time, for whatever personal reason, not to discourage people from crying.
