LPT: If you are ever in an car accident where you are not at fault, check with buildings and businesses near the accident scene for surveillance footage of the accident.

content:
While they won't give you the video tape, you can capture the footage using your phone.

I met a guy today who was driving down a one-way street when suddenly a woman came FLING backwards down the street in her car, crashing into his car and totaling it.  He was found at fault by the insurance company because it appeared he struck the woman.  However, he checked with a nursing home next to the accident and they DID have a camera pointed at the scene, and the nursing home allowed him to use his phone to capture their footage of the accident and send to the insurance company to exonerate him.  Stay safe!  

EDIT: This is if you don't have a dashcam.  Which is a good idea as well.
