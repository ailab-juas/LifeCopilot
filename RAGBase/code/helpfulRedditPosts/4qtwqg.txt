title:
YSK That using coconut(or any) oil as lubricant can weaken the structural integrity of condoms and increase the chances of leaks or breaks.

content:
Coconut oil is a great substance with many uses, but science is not in our favor this time. Thanks to chemistry and solubility and such, any latex condom is going to be weakened by contact with an oil, which may lead to holes or breaks. Non latex condoms may be fine, depending on what they're made with. You're going to the trouble of using condoms, presumably you want to be safe. Stay safe by not putting yourself at greater risk of breakage. Use condoms and water based lubricant to avoid this risk.

Happy sexing!
