LPT: If you're growing fruits and vegetables to be frugal, consider the cost of the purchase you're replacing.

Planning our garden for spring and, because I was just laid off due to the state closing non essential businesses, my top priority was saving money.

If you compare the cost per lb. of different types of produce there's a wildly different return on your investment depending on what you decide to plant.

I compared the price paid in our local store to the price per unit of expected yield and the quick and dirty summary is: Herbs &gt; Tomatoes &gt; Greens &gt; Roots (garlic, onions, potatoes etc..)

So if you're planning to start a garden to save money, make sure you look at the cost of the produce you're replacing, and start with the varietals that have the best return on investment. 

5lb bags of potatoes are like 2 dollars for us most weeks, and that represents a significant investment of time and money to reproduce. Compared to herbs, which cost about 4 dollars in the store for just a couple of ounces, or cherry tomatoes that are $3.5 a quart.
