LPT: Don’t forget to knock on your car hood before starting it and leaving!

content:
Now that it’s getting colder in areas, there could be small animals sleeping in there and you may not notice until it’s too late. A few knocks on the hood and wheel wells only takes a few seconds and could possibly save an animals life.

Edit: it’s marked NSFW because I saw a post on here about someone who smelt something in their car and lifted the hood and their was a kitty who got shocked in it.
