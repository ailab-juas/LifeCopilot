LPT: If you’re a renter with low water pressure, buy a decent shower head. They can typically be installed in less than 5 minutes and make a huge difference.

Update:
Yes, of course you don’t have to be a renter to do this. I directed it toward renters because it is an inexpensive and easily reversible solution. Also, low-flow shower heads and water pressure issues are very common in rental properties which leads me to...

Apparently there is a very serious difference between water “pressure” and “flow.” This is a solution to the low “flow” issue, but most of you understood what I was trying to say anyway. Sorry for offending you water purists.

Additionally, don’t go out and buy anything super expensive for this. I can’t remember the model name of my shower head but it was about $20 and is Waterpik brand.

Happy showering!
