LPT - Do not carry large sums of cash in the USA. You may fall victim to civil asset forfeiture

content:
Caring large sums of cash in the USA can cause concern from police and other enforcement entities like TSA that the cash is for illegal activities. Police and federal enforcement can and will seize your cash and do so without charging you with an actual crime. You then have the burden of proving the cash as legitimate.

Edit: corrected cease to seize
