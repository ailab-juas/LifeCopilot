YSK The success rate of CPR is discouraging, but with CPR and organ donation even if you can't save one life you may instead save many.

I have always been pretty pesimistic when it came to CPR. I always try but don't expect a good outcome. Well, I found out that while the person I tried to save died, they were an organ donor and gave 5 people another chance at life. Without prehospital care this may have not been possible. I never really thought about this, I can still make a difference trying even if it's not that I save the life in front of me. 

If any of you don't think CPR is worth trying, please think about the other possibilities and get yourself certified.

Thank you for reading.
