title:
LPT: When people make disparaging comments, just say thank you.

content:
“You’ve gain weight” 
“Thank you”
“…”

Then they have to either settle with being misunderstood or double down and explicitly explain that they were intentionally being unkind. 

I work at a church and religious people use coded language to say crummy things in camouflaged/passive aggressive ways. Today someone told me, “that was an…interesting sermon…” 

“Thank you.” &lt;smile&gt; 

Then I got to watch them squirm as they tried to decide how to respond. 

Tl;dnr: when people are passive aggressive, just say thank you.
