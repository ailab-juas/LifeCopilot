LPT: If you're applying for jobs in person, purposefully apply for a few places you really don't want first. When you get to the places you do really want, you'll be way more prepared and less nervous.

This might just be common sense, practice makes perfect... I recently made the mistake of getting super excited about a few places, going up to them and then because I didn't have any previous experience, I really lacked confidence. Needless to say, I didn't hear from those places and ended up making good impressions with the places I didn't even want to work at!
