title:
YSK that "Clinginess" or overdependence is a trauma response, and can strain relationships

content:
Why YSK: While it can feel natural to look for someone to satisfy your deepest needs for security, it isn't something people can sustain. Oftentimes, the need for intense affirmation can cause the opposite to be given in a relationship- so it's important to know this before entering one. If you find yourself overly dependent on someone, it may be helpful to take a step back and ask yourself if you're assuming things about them based on pain you've felt in the past. If you realize this is true about yourself, it may be helpful to seek some counseling, or talk about it with others. That's what I did!
