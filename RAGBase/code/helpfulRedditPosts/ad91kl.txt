LPT: Be mindful of poorer friends when suggesting splitting the bill equally in a restaurant. Some people will choose cheaper options because they're on a budget

content:
I don't earn a lot of money and get major anxiety if anyone in my friendship group suggests going to a restaurant. Last week, I drank tap water and ordered cheap food (I'm veggie so my meals are usually cheaper anyway, but I did fancy a few beers) because I knew I only had a certain amount of money in my bank, while my friends ordered whatever they wanted, including multiple alcoholic drinks, spending nearly double what I was spending. When the bill came, nobody noticed my discomfort (I tried dropping hints!) and I ended up having to split the bill equally. To them it was probably a few quid, no biggie, ("it all balances out eventually"), but it absolutely ruined my evening as my card was declined in front of everyone

EDIT: I should have said, my close friends know that I'm skint (I talk about it openly), just maybe didn't realise how dire the situation was at that moment. But when it's a large group with lots of friends and their partners who you don't know very well it can be humiliating to draw attention to it in front of a table of people. I know *technically* it solves the problem to announce to everyone that you'll only be paying for what you personally consumed and no more, but it's nicer for someone to notice: "XX didn't have drinks or a dessert, shall we all just pay for what we had?"
