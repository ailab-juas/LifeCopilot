title:
LPT: Amazon will be enabling a feature called sidewalk that will share your Wi-Fi and bandwidth with anyone with an Amazon device automatically. Stripping away your privacy and security of your home network!

content:
This is an opt out system meaning it will be enabled by default. Not only does this pose a major security risk it also strips away privacy and uses up your bandwidth. Having a mesh network connecting to tons of IOT devices and allowing remote entry even when disconnected from WiFi is an absolutely terrible security practice and Amazon needs to be called out now!

In addition to this, you may have seen this post earlier. This is because the moderators of this subreddit are suposedly removing posts that speak about asmazon sidewalk negatively, with no explanation given.

How to opt out:
1) Open Alexa App.
2) Go to settings
3) Account Settings
4) Amazon Sidewalk
5) Turn it off

Edit: As far as i know, this is only in the US, so no need to worry if you are in other countries.
