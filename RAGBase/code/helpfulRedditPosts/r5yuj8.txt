LPT: Get into a habit of cleaning out trash from your car every time you pump your gas

content:
It’s an easy way to keep you car free of receipts, straw wrappers, water bottles, etc. It’s also free downtime that everyone has while you fill up your tank!

This also prevents buildup and clutter.. so having to take someone in your car randomly isn’t such a stressor anymore.

Edit; thanks for the unexpected awards everyone! I’ve never been the recipient of any before!
