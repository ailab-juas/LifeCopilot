LPT If you ever get lost in a large hospital or any buildings, ask the housekeeping staff for directions instead of the nursing staff. Chances are housekeeping staff can map the entire building in their heads.

EDIT:  

Well, this blew up, I didn't expect this.

I literally came up with this within 10 seconds while sitting in a bathroom at the hospital I work at.

I can see a lot of people having mixed opinions, let me clarify what I had in my head:  
I am not trying to tell people nursing staff doesn't know how to get around in a hospital, they do in fact.

But in my experience, when patients are lost and are looking for directions, for entirely different departments within a hospital, some staff have never left their department so their spatial knowledge about the area could be limited.

Housekeeping staff, on the other hand, will typically have visited every part of the hospital on a weekly basis, so they could know exactly where you need to go and give you accurate directions promptly, hell I'd even bring you myself there.
