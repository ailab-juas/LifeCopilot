LPT: Instead of googling a cooking question, call your mom/grandmother. It's a nice excuse to call them and will make them feel needed and loved.

Edit: As others have pointed out, not everyone has a mother/grandmother who can cook. Essentially it could be extrapolated as "Call your loved ones in reference to things they are good at rather than googling the solution, as it will hopefully make them feel needed and gives you a nice excuse to call."
