YSK that in most major U.S. cities, it is common courtesy to use the right-hand side of an escalator for standing and the left-hand side for walking.

This is less of a fact and more of a common courtesy that is shared in many U.S. cities, and different cultures may handle this different ways, so I am just speaking about the United States here.

Typically, the right-hand side of the escalator should be reserved for people who don't feel like walking up or down the escalator. The left-hand side should be left open for people who wish to walk up and down the escalator to get where they are going more quickly. 

Edit: /u/invisiblezipper shared [this ad campaign by Chicago's CTA](http://www.transitchicago.com/courtesy/) that highlights some things you can in using public transport to help make everyone's commute more efficient, more safe, and less of a headache! Thank you!
