YSK: Domestic Violence in a relationship does not have to become violent in order to be abuse.

YSK: Domestic Violence does not mean that you have to be hit in order to be abused.

Why YSK is that the psychological/emotional abuse will last longer than any bruise. Most relationships that end up becoming physically violent have a build up that includes name calling, threats, social isolation, control, and manipulation of finances and children. A typical cycle of Domestic violence begins with
1. Tension building- you feel like you are walking on egg shells. Waiting for something to happen. 
2. Event- this is the big outburst/violence which makes you think “I can’t take this anymore. I have to leave.”
3. Honeymoon phase- the abuser is apologetic and promises to never do it again. Tries to shower you with affection/attention and wins you back.  

Then it starts all over again with the tension phase becoming longer, event being bigger, and the honeymoon phase becoming shorter.
