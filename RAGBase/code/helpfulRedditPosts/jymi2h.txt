YSK- There is a tool for everything. If the job you are doing seems too hard or taking too long, it might be because you are using the wrong tool.

Why YSK: Most people who aren't around tools don't know this, myself included. My husband has shown me stuff I didn't know even existed recently. I though you could throw any wrench or pliers on anything and it would work. I ended up stripping the bolt, breaking something or it would take a million times longer. I would then get myself in a bigger pickle.



Edit: Thank you kind redditors for the awards. I am honored!!!

Edit 2: There is a lot of good information in this post you guys posted.    And r/specializedtools is one of the coolest subs out there! If you like neat tools and that you would never thought of in million years existed.... its highly recommend it.
