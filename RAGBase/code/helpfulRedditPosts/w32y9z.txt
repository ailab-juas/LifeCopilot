LPT: college students hoping to make the most of your education, seek out the tutoring services available on your campus and use them as much as you possibly can, regardless of your current (grades).

Tutoring is the most impactful intervention for improving both absolute and relative learning. While these services are certainly available to help students struggling in their courses, all students should use them.

Whether you need help balancing an equation, troubleshooting code, or writing your senior thesis, tutors can help. 

Tutors can provide assignment clarification, improve your understanding of core concepts, guide you to apply new concepts, share resources and tips (many tutors know your specific class/professors and happily provide inside information), help strengthen your skills, and provide you with general student advice. 

While faculty often offer similar benefits during office hours, they can’t meet with all students. They likely can’t relate to you as well as a peer tutor. And most never received any training on adult learning theory. 

Tutors provide individualized attention and can help you become a better learner, not just a better test scorer.

Plus, the service is free. Well, kind of. See, you’re already paying for it through your student fees and such. So, at the end of the day, you need to decide who you want to be and why you are in school. Are  you going to let that money vanish without collecting the benefits? Do you want to earn a lower gpa? Retain less of the knowledge your paying to acquire? And be a worse job candidate?

Didn’t think so! 

Bonus: it’s a great place to meet new people outside of the bars.
