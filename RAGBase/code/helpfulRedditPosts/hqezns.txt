YSK: Your waiter/bartender isn’t flirting with you, they are doing their job

content:
I think this gets lost in translation a lot. In the US service industry, many of the staff rely on tips. We have regulars we may give freebies/discounts to every now and again, but we work for tips - not your cell phone number.

Edit: This isn’t a blanket statement, obviously some waitstaff due flirt. However, they usually make their intention known beyond “yes sir” and “no ma’am”
