YSK there's a site that checks if your email may have been compromised by an illegal access to a database containing your login information.

content:
You can also subscribe to receive notifications in case of new database breaches that may contain your email/password. 

Here: [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

Needless to say, in case your information is at risk, consider changing your passwords for the more sensitive sites you use.

Disclaimer: I'm in no way affiliated with the website, just stumbled upon it.

EDIT: I can't personally vouch for how secure this site is, but there's enough credible sources to convince me.
