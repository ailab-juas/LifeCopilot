LPT: Add cinnamon and essential oils to a pot of water, boil on medium heat to fill your home with a festive, holiday scent and humidify the dry air.

A quick and easy way to make your home smell lovely as fuck and humidify the air during the dry, flaky skin inducing winter months.

What you need:

A small pot.(I don't pay attention to actual sizes, so let's just say one of those little ones that are perfect for one ramen.)

Water, filtered or unfiltered- Doesn't fucking matter but fancy blogger type people will say filtered. (I fill it to about an inch and a half below the top)

A few shakes of cinnamon powder. (cinnamon sticks if you wanna get fancy)

As many drops of essential oil as you like. I use peppermint oil, balsam fir needle, or orange oil.

If you don't have essential oils and don't want to buy any, cinnamon alone smells really great and festive as well!

You can also add sliced fruit like apples or oranges if you wanna go all out. 

Enjoy feeling like a festive ass adult who's killin it at having your shit together and making your house smell like Christmas.
