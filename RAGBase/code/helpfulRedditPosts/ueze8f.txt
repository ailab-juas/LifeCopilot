YSK simple first date tips

Why YSK these tips should make a great first impression. 

Clean your fingernails. First move you might be able to make is the hand hold. Maybe when youâ€™re walking down stairs &amp; they feel that gentle touch, the first contact. 

That first kiss is next but make sure your dental health is good. You are used to your own bad breath &amp; your friend may not have the heart to tell you. Floss, use mouthwash and bring breath mints if you need to.

Turn your phone off before the date starts. Let nothing distract you from the details they share about themselves. 

Goodnight &amp; good luck.
