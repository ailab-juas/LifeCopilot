LPT: Teenagers, if you have a toxic friend, cut them off.

content:
By toxic friend I mean someone who you regard as your friend, but doesn't do anything friends are supposed to. I knew a guy I thought was my best friend, and we were at first. But towards the end of the friendship he was acting like he was better than me.

This made me feel I wasn't good enough and was lucky enough to have him as a 'best friend'. It really destroyed my confidence. 

In reality, I deserved better than that and I eventually decided enough was enough and completely cut him off. I didn't speak to him for about the year we had left at school together, and oh my God what a difference it has made. My life is 10x better than before, when we were 'friends'.

This might seem like a petty childish thing, but a friendship like that is really damaging to your mental health. If you have a toxic friend, for the love of God get rid of them. You do not deserve to be treated like shit by anyone.
