YSK Costco and Sam's Club gas pumps are designed to reach the opposite side of your vehicle.

Why YSK: Given the rise in gas prices I've seen many people taking advantage of cheaper gas from Costco/Sam's Club. But I see a lot of people creating long lines on one side of the pump while the other side is open. Also, these gas stations are usually one-way drive to expedite traffic flow. Yet I've seen people drive in the opposite direction, completely disregarding the traffic flow, just to line up on their tank side.

You don't need to line up on your tank side. The pump hoses at these stations are extra long so you can pull it to the opposite side of your car. Typically there's a pulley system that holds the hose off the ground. All you need to do is pull it. It will reach.

So next time you pull up at Costco/Sam's Club for gas it doesn't matter which side your gas tank is on. Just pull up to an open station. If everyone knew this the lines would flow so much faster.
