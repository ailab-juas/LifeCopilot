LPT: If you're not a "car person", find a neighborhood mechanic and always get small maintenance (oil changes, car inspections, etc) done there so when big stuff comes up, they'll know you and won't screw you over on pricing

content:
My dad taught me this "trick" and it has served me well.  Sure, an oil change might cost less at the Jiffy Lube down the street, but if I pay a few dollars more at "my guy's shop" each time, he's more likely to view me as a loyal customer. He never tries to upsell me like the cheap places do, is honest about maintenance timelines (I asked him how my brakes were looking and he told me they'd be fine for a few more months) and even tells me when its cheaper to go elsewhere (he checked a flat for me for free, told me he couldn't patch it, saw that the model of tire I had was cheaper at the warehouse club in town and suggested I go there instead).

TLDR: Pay a little more for basic maintenance at a good mechanic and create a trusting relationship that will save you big in the long run

EDIT because as this gets more attention, people are assuming I meant either 1) every mechanic will try to screw you if you don't give them ALL your business (obviously not true) or 2) a mechanic you are friendly with will always give you the best deal. As with all LPTs, your experience will vary and you should do your research first to find a good mechanic (online reviews, word of mouth) and do your research on what things "should" cost (approximately) so you know if you're getting hosed or not. But the essence of the LPT is "be kind and whenever possible, be a loyal customer and it should serve you well in the long run"
