LPT: If you aren't doing what you need to be doing, imagine you're an actor playing the role of you, and you're doing a terrible job

content:
If you believe you need to make better / more productive choices, pretend to be an actor rehearsing the part of [you], who's read the role completely wrong.


i.e... "What the fuck am I doing?! This isn't the script!"


u/kidbeer and others have the idea. Interpreted slightly differently but I like it, whatever works for you. I'm not saying to forever pretend you're not you, but initially as a framing device to get you back into a better rhythm.

TL;DR : Pretend you're a method actor portraying the best version of yourself.
