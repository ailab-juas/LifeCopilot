LPT: If you want to stop overeating and improve your relationship with food, only eat in your dining area with your devices away. Having a content-free designated eating spot will make you much more sensitive to your satiety cues and make you more mindful about your diet and eating habits.

The rule is that you can eat however much you want, but you can't be watching videos / scrolling reddit / playing games / working / other big distractions. If you slip and realize you're eating away from your DES, no big deal, just take your food to the kitchen and eat it there, don't beat yourself up. I promise you that you will eat until you have had a satisfying amount, get bored, and then go back to doing whatever fun or occupying thing you were doing before. I find that reading is okay because I don't mindlessly eat while I'm doing it but that might be a personal thing. Also, I felt like eating habits were one place where I didn't have control of my life and starting doing this really made me feel like I do have the power to do little things to improve my health and mental state. Be well everyone
