LPT: Your time is always better spent helping another person rather than those who don't want what you have to offer. People in need have to want to be helped first, no matter how bad you think they need it.

This of course excludes life or death scenarios

EDIT: Ok some of you are saying it's a wrong take on helping but you gotta give it some thought.

If someone refuses your help, tell them you can wait until they're ready. If you do this, at the very least, you can give your time/energy to someone else until then.
