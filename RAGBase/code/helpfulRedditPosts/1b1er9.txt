title:
LPT: when you get a business card from someone, take stone time after meeting then to write a short note about this person on the back

content:
Next time you contact them, check the card so you can pick up from where you left last. This will impress the person a lot especially if you remember something that is important to them. If you do it genuinely, people will like you.

EDIT: Oops - I spelled the title wrong - so much for predictive text on my "smartphone"
