YSK: Abortion Pill Access available by mail, to any state in the U.S.

content:
YSK that if you are a person who wants to re-gain their period in the U.S., you can get the abortion pill by mail up to 10 weeks pregnant for $110 from Europe (Aid Access). It is a legitimate doctor. You will have to answer some questions, then pills will be prescribed to you and mailed from a pharmacy.  

Why YSK: So you can have control over your own body. Recently, a new law in TX has made abortion after 6 weeks illegal, before many women know they are pregnant(4 weeks after conception). Many other states in the U.S. require several doctor appointments, waiting periods, and ultrasounds - all of which are extremely expensive.
