LPT: If you have an ingrown nail, using dental floss will help.

content:
Doctor showed me this the other day. You slide dental floss under the nail as far as possible and leave a piece on both sides hanging. This will alleviate the pressure and a lot of the pain and after a few days (taking care to change it daily) your nail will start to grow upwards and out of your skin.

Edit 2: Some people only go under the corner that the ingrown is on, itâ€™s a preference thing. Also you just need to put it under the white part of the nail, as well as you can.
