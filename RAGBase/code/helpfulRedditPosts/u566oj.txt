LPT: There is never, ever a good reason to take out your frustration on the people you care about.

content:
This is hard because life is often frustrating, but don't take that out on the ones close to you. When you snap at people, talk down to them or dismiss them they'll often become anxious and distant which will erode your relationships. 

It's fine to tell someone that you're in a bad mood and need time to yourself, or to tell them what happened with your anger firmly directed at the legitimate source of it, but be nice to the people who care about you even if it's difficult.
