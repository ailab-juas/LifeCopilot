title:
YSK : Credit cards with contactless payments have cumulative spending limits that are reset when you pay using your PIN.

content:
If you are seeing proximity transactions refused despite having available credit, you have probably reached the limit.

Try the transaction again using the chip card and your PIN, the limit will be reset and contactless payments will begin working properly again.

If you regularly use your PIN, you will probably never hit the limit.
