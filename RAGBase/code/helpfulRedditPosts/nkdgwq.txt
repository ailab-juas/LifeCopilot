LPT: Easy way to figure out if you should us "I" or "Me" in a sentence

content:
When trying to figoure out if you should use "I" or "me" in a sentence where you are discussing you and another person, remove the other person from the sentence, and read it to yourself. It should make grammatical sense.

For instance: "Me and my friend went to the store" --&gt; "Me went to the store." That's obviously not right.

"My friend and I went to the store" --&gt; "I went to the store" That's right.

"He was really friendly to I and my friend" --&gt; "He was really friendly to I" Doesn't sound right

"He was really friendly to me and my friend" --&gt; "He was really friendly to me" That's better. 

If you remember this, your writing (and speaking) will be much more eloquent.
