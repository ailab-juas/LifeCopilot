title:
LPT A kitchen cleaning tip that wasn't obvious to me for years - but I used to clean around the grill knobs, cleaning in between and careful not to turn the knob. It never dawned on me that you can just remove the knobs. And easily clean the knobs. Then easily clean the pane that the knobs are on.
