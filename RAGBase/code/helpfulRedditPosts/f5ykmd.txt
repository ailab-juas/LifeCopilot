YSK that in some US states, while under anesthesia, (soon-to-be) physicians are not required to obtain your consent for unnecessary pelvic, best, urogenital, prostate and rectal exams. In most cases, these exam are done only for training purposes.

[This article published by the NY Times yesterday explains this in details.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/health/pelvic-medical-exam-unconscious.html)  "In 2003, Dr. Silver-Isenstadt was co-author of a [study](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(02)71415-4/fulltext) titled “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He surveyed 401 students at five Pennsylvania medical schools and found that 90 percent had performed pelvic exams on anesthetized patients."

I'm not sure about other countries, but I have a contact in Belgium who told me they had to do similar things, sometimes without consent, during their medical internship to become a doctor. As a student they felt terrible about it be were pressured into it by their mentor and had to oblige in fear of falling.
