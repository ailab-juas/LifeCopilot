YSK WD-40 softens chewing gum, use it to get gum off your shoe

content:
I have stepped in gum a couple of times now, and I have used WD-40 both times. I spray it on and leave it there for a minute, then it comes off either like dirt or all together really easily. I usually take it off with a bit of paper towel.
