LPT: For holiday parties, always carry an extra giftcard and giftcard box in case you forgot someone. They won't notice and odds are if you forgot them, you wouldn't know what to get them anyway.

content:
Keep the gift card universal (Amex, Visa, Mastercard) so it's versatile enough for anyone and if you don't give it away you can simply use it yourself.


*Edit: some additional points from this fantastic community: gift cards are better than cash because it allows the person to spend without guilt (ie not on groceries or gas but likely something they'd enjoy). Gift cards don't look lazy...cash simply implies "I forgot." 

Also, any fees are small and the gifter gets charged not the recipient. Retail stores don't decline them anymore if the purchase is above the amount on the card...they simply deduct like a normal gift card now.

This also works great in a "double-gift" situation where someone got the same or very similar gift for someone that you had. Simply give the gift card and return the extra gift.
