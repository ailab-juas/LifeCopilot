title:
YSK that some intimate lubes are not good for insertion play time

content:
Why YSK: my fiancee went to one of those girls only "toy" parties and found out that the reason she would get yeast infections was the lube we used sometimes. It never occurred to us, but check the ingredients list and if it mentions sucrose or any other chemical name for sugar, don't use in her. On him won't be an issue, but make sure it's ALL off before going in her. Same applies to any toys used that will be inserted. The sugar is what causes yeast to multiply, just like baking a cake from scratch at home. Don't turn your girl (or yourself) into a cake.

Lubes are labeled as "for novelty use" most of the time, so they are not held to regulations for safety like a condom. On that note, if using condoms, make sure it won't be damaged by the lube of your choice. 

Final note.  I know some may be upset by my lack of inclusion on trans folks, but this info is for born female. If it helps, just ask yourself if you have a data port (in which case be careful and use the YSK) or a USB stick (in which case be mindful of the port you're going to plug into).
