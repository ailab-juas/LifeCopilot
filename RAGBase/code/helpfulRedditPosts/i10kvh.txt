LPT If a place is "always hiring" there is a reason why and it has to do with a very high turnover rate.

That said, places that are hard to get into are generally better. For instance, I once looked into getting a job as a local firefighter. The fire chief shook his head and said, "No one ever quits. The pay is good, the benefits are great and the pension is even better. The only way anyone ever leaves is if they are fired, retires, and I haven't lost a firefighter yet."

The ones that are tough to get are the way to go, usually.

Edit: As some people have correctly pointed out, there are exceptions to this. For instance jobs requiring rare skills, jobs no one is really interested in, or businesses are need more people because their work volume keeps increasing.
