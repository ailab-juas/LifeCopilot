title:
LPT If you're mounting your new TV, tape the legs to the back of the TV for safe keeping.

content:
I used to work in an electronics store and people would come in constantly asking for replacement legs for their TV- which no store I know of sells. Replacing the legs for a specific model TV is either difficult or impossible.

Even if you think your TV will always be mounted, just tape the legs to the backside just in case.

You may move homes and be unable to mount the TV right away or at all.
