title:
LPT: Avoid the second person ("you") in discussions or arguments as they needlessly make the stakes of the conversation personal.

content:
Examples:

* Instead of "Why do **you** think abortion should be illegal?" use "Why should abortion be illegal?"
* Instead of "Why do **you** think we should introduce this product?" use "Why should we introduce this product?"
* Instead of "**You** want to go to Restaurant A, or we could go to Restaurant B" use "We could go to Restaurant A, or we could go to Restaurant B."

Using the second person implies that the other person is invested in an idea that you oppose, which turns an abstract conversation into a personal one.  Avoiding "you" makes it more difficult for a discussion to take a combative turn.
