LPT: Get rid of rust by rubbing it with aluminum foil soaked in vinegar

content:
Tried this on an old bike I had and it removed most of the rust instantly. [Source.](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/5-home-remedies-to-remove-rust-140463) I haven't tried the other methods provided by that page but I can confirm the aluminum foil soaked in (apple-cider) vinegar to work astonishingly. 

EDIT: Front page! woohoo!!! I just want to say that you guys had some great alternatives that I'll be trying on tougher spots on the bike. Thanks to those who provided a scientific explanation to how this works, and even suggested other liquids that work just as well, if not better than vinegar (water, gasoline, alcohol, etc.). I should also mention that this LPT works best when you use the shiny(er?) side of the aluminum foil. One more thing, since people keep questioning me, I posted this at around 2 in the morning and the word "soaked" seemed appropriate and I didn't feel like looking up another word :D Again, thanks for all the karma and I hope this post is able to help people as well as it helped me.
