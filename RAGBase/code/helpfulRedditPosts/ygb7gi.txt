LPT - Donâ€™t ever proactively tell a car salesman what car payment you are looking for or can afford

content:
 Finance managers have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves when putting together dealsâ€¦and giving that info upfront is like showing your hand in a poker match. The same holds true for down payments! Car dealerships can add interest on to the interest the loaner bank is charging, and down payments are usually just profit in their pocket. I sold cars and worked in special finance for 8 years, and holy shit I sold a LOT of cars (until my conscience couldnâ€™t beat it anymore). Also - buying used cars gives you a TON more negotiation power, and doc fees are bullshit, too. Why would you have to pay 500-700 dollars for paperwork, especially now a days where everything is electronic?? ðŸ˜‚
