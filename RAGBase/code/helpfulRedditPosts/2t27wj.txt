LPT: Always replace your headlights in pairs when one burns out. Then keep the old bulb that is still good as an emergency spare.

This helped me late last night in the fog. Had a headlight go out and used the old bulb I saved as a spare.

Edit: I don't represent an Auto Parts store of any kind. 

Edit 2: Some people are not understanding the term "emergency" spare.  While a dead headlight bulb may not seem like a big deal under normal conditions, in dense fog it's dangerous. In dense fog, you can't drive with your brights on, it becomes nearly impossible to see where you are going. Also, driving with one headlight or dim headlights make it difficult for other drivers to see you, let alone accurately judge the distance between you and them. It is a safety issue. This advice is apparently not for everyone.
