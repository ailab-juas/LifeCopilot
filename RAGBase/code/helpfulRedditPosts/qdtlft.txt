LPT: You can be close friends with someone without having to talk to them or text them regularly. Having these kinds of friendships are a normal part of becoming an adult.

I’ve noticed a trend online where people (mainly younger people) talk about having a ‘low maintenance’ best friend. Essentially it’s a friend who you don’t see or talk to for months - but when you do see them, it’s like no time has passed at all. You both give each other an extensive update of everything that has happened in your lives and just have an overall spectacular time. You promise each other you’re definitely going to meet up more often but ultimately you never do, and the cycle continues. 

When I see posts talking about this situation, it’s usually presented in a sad, guilty and self-deprecating sort of way. 

I think the routine of school or college can trick us into thinking that we need to be in contact with our friends every day for our relationships to stay alive. For those of us who have grown up with social media, perhaps we feel extra guilt because we *know* that keeping up with a friend can be as easy as sending them a meme, or reacting to an Instagram story every now and then. If we don’t do these small things, it can sometimes make you feel like a bad friend. 

But you’re not. Ultimately, this is an incredibly normal thing to go through with friendships and it’s part of getting older. There are tons of reasons for friends to lose contact for long periods - people get jobs, they get busy, move across the country, etc. As long as neither of you hold it against each other, you can always pick up where you left off.

Edit: there's a grammatical error in the title, whoops!
