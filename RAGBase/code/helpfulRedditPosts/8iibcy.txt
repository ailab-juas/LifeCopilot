LPT: Your utility company will most likely give you hundreds of dollars of energy efficient light bulbs, shower heads, etc for FREE

content:
I just got 15 free LEDs from Duke Energy in Ohio. Others will offer showerheads, faucet aerators, and other energy-saving products that save you tons of money on bills.

Most will offer them for free, others offer rebates or heavy discounts.

I found out from their website, but you can also Google "[your energy provider] free LEDs" or shower heads or whatever you're looking for.

Here are just some of the examples:

* [Duke Energy](https://www.duke-energy.com/home/products/free-leds)
* [Idaho Power](https://www.idahopower.com/ways-to-save/savings-for-your-home/rebates-and-offers/energy-saving-kits/)
* [Public Service Oklahoma](http://www.powerforwardwithpso.com/my-home/energy-savings-kits/)
* [Indianapolis Power &amp; Light](https://www.iplpower.com/Residential/Home_Energy_Savings/Power_Tools/Energy_Savings_Kit/)
* [Wisconsin Utility Companies](http://www.energyfederation.org/focusonenergy/packs.html)
* [First Energy](https://www.firstenergycorp.com/content/fecorp/newsroom/news_articles/energy-conservation-kit-available-to-residential-customers-of-fi.html)

Hope this helps!
