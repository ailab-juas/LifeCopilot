YSK about Bittorrent bundles - free songs, albums, and movies that are officially and legally released by their creators. Moby, De La Soul, and Thom Yorke are just some of them.

Whenever someone tried to argue that torrents are just for piracy, I show them the BT Bundles, because it's such an effective way for artists to promote themselves and share their creations with their audience.

You can find tons of bundles at https://bundles.bittorrent.com/. Here's [Moby's Innocents](https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/moby-innocents), [De La Soul's Smell the Da.I.S.Y](https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/smell-the-daisy), and Thom Yorke's newest solo work, [Tomorrow's Modern Boxes](https://bundles.bittorrent.com/bundles/tomorrowsmodernboxes) . Most of the artists release a couple tracks for free, with the option to pay them for the full album. These are incredibly fast torrents, too, because so many people seed them.
