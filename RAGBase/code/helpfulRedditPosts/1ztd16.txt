[LPTR]: How to improve handwriting legibility--specifically for messy/cluttered/frantic "doctor handwriting."

content:
This seems like a simple question, but I've been on the struggle bus with this for three or four years now. 

I'm a sophomore in college and when I was a sophomore in high school I decided I was going to only write in cursive. I just thought it looked neater, more sophisticated, and I assumed it would overall tighten up my handwriting, forcing it to be neat. After a year or so it became habit--at first note-taking was a nightmare as I forced myself to write in cursive. As I got it down-pat, I noticed once again that my legibility was not good for those other than me. Professors can usually read it, but if I'm working on a group project or sharing notes I usually get questions. 

My cursive seems to vary between two styles: sometimes very sharp and narrow letters, and other times it gets very lazy, curvy and flat (think of a signature where the name is the first letter followed by a lackadaisical line hinting at the rest of the characters).

What can I do to neaten it up? It's legible to me and I can write quickly, but I get self-conscious when others have to read my chicken scratch. 

tl;dr

I have "doctor" handwriting. Four years ago I converted to all cursive in an effort to be sophisticated/mature, but at this point it's gotten messy again and I'd like to clean it up. 

Thanks for any tips, opinions, etc.
