YSK Pizza Delivery Drivers don’t make shit unless you tip.

content:
We don’t get the delivery fee. Some of us don’t even get a mileage reimbursement. It depends on the company. Ik it sounds crazy illegal, but they also made us sign away our rights to unionize when we took the job. Which yeah, Ik some of you are thinking, “that’s your own fault.” But shit ain’t that simple. Sometimes you just gotta take a job cause bills. So don’t be an asshole. Tip your pizza delivery driver. Gas ain’t cheap. Insurance ain’t cheap. Not to mention I can easily put 100 miles on my car on a Friday night. You don’t have pizza $ if you don’t have tip $. Thank you for listening to my rant.
