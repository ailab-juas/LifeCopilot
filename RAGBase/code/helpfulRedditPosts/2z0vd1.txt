LPT: When parking in a parking garage, especially a low clearance one, avoid parking in the basement if possible in case your car becomes disabled.

My car was parked in the basement of the parking garage at work and my starter went out.  It took several days (and lots of added expense) to track down and hire a tow truck capable of fitting into the garage to tow it out.  Had it been on an upper level I could have put the car in neutral and, with some assistance, just rolled it outside to be towed from there.  I haven't parked in a parking garage basement since.

Edit: Well, TIL that there are a number of you on reddit that are mean and judgmental as f*ck, and I hope the lot of you leave the upper floors of parking garages empty while you park in basements and your cars are flooded and you are all eaten by zombies during the zombie apocalypse!  Haha I am in healthcare not in mechanics, fixing a starter myself doesn't come as easily to me as it may to some of you.  I was barely 20 years old and relatively new to the area at the time (obviously a tow strap/friend with a truck etc occurred to me but that requires knowing someone, anyone really, who you'd be willing to call with a a problem) and I was also pretty poor which further restricted my options.

Also, obligatory "wow front page"!
