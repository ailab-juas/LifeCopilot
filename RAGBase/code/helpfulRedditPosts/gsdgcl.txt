LPT: If you think you are hungry and nothing sounds good, or if you are hungry for only one specific thing, you probably aren't hungry.

content:
This is (edit: probably) eating out of boredom and/or pleasure seeking.  Just ride it out if you are trying to eat less.  Distract yourself with something

Edited to add: I'm surprised I have to add this disclaimer but if you suffer from mental illness, depression, autism, or disordered eating this does not apply. That warning also applied to all LPTs
