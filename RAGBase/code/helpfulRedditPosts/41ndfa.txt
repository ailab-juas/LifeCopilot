YSK That a person with a disabled placard on their car may not always have a disability you can see.

content:
My 52 year old uncle has had lung disease for six years, and his lungs only get around 45 mm/Hg. I've heard people commenting when he gets out of the car "HE doesn't look disabled" insinuating that he's faking a disease or has a fake placard. 

Lung disease, cardiovascular issues, and other non-visible issues qualify a person (rightfully) for a disabled placard.
