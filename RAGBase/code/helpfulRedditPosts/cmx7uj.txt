LPT: if you’re an unsalaried worked, ALWAYS keep your own private log of hours worked.

content:
I’ve just stopped working a part time job I’ve held for two years that had very infrequent shifts and fairly lax management. Most of the time I was there the manager was super on the ball with logging hours, but he’s human and makes mistakes so just as a cross-reference I logged my own hours as well. There was only one time I didn’t get paid with him as manager, and it was just that he’d forgotten to put the hours in - it was in his own records so it was quickly rectified. 

For the last few months, however, he’s been on sick leave and another staff member took over management. I’m friendly with this other guy, but his record keeping was poor. Unsurprisingly, come the end of me working there, I went over my records and my payslips and was several hours’ pay short. When I raised this with the finance higher-ups they said the temp-manager’s notes showed he’d worked one of the shifts that I had worked. Fortunately I had a record of it, as did another staff member (due to agreeing which shifts we’d each take) as well as an email to the temp-manager from the night confirming that I had worked that shift. 

Because my record-keeping habits went back through the whole two years and had been in line with theirs the whole way through, and because my practice of emailing to confirm my hours was consistent too, they were happy to take that evidence. It was an honest mistake by the temp-manager (he mixed up two different dates) but one that could have cost me a whole shift’s work. 

Maybe not the most important LPT ever but it might save you some trouble sometime.

Edit: unsalaried worker*. Sorry, on new phone and not used to the autocorrect/am generally an incompetent human (pick one).
