LPT: Before going to a porn site, google "safebrowsing:(website)" to see a 90-day history of malware attempts on its visitors.

The first result will be a google diagnostic page. 

Not every website is supported.

Check the date of the last analysis.

You don't need to enter every video's url, just the site's homepage.

You can do subsequent searches by changing the diagnostic page's url.

Historically clean websites will be dirty some weeks and dirty ones will sometimes be clean after a period of attacks.

From what I know, these malware downloads are not sponsored by the websites but by hackers.


Happy fapping.
