LPT: When going to a zoo or similar park (when it opens) walk to the opposite end of the park to start your tour. You will have the park mostly to yourself for a good portion of your visit.

Also, most people go to the right (counter-clockwise) when entering the park.  If you work your way the same direction you won't mix with the large entry crowd at all and by the time you get back to the entrance (to start the 2nd half of your visit) the crowds are usually trickling in.
