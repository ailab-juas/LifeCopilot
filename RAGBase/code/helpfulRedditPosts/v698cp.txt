title:
YSK Most companies just trash your returns

content:
Why YSK: Retail worker for a beauty chain, we get a lot of returns for hair products and appliances. (Ex. Curling Irons, Brushes, Hair Spray, and Hot Rollers.) For obvious sanitary reasons, we are NOT allowed to put your used product back on the shelf even if it’s only used once. I get if you want a refund/exchange but I just thought YSK we have the cut the cord and trash it. If you’re aspiring to reduce your waste then gift it to someone else.

EDIT: If you buy a product that is broken, defective, or just didn’t work out for your needs DO NOT BE ASHAMED TO GET A REFUND. You are 100% within your right to do so. 
However, people have been known to abuse return policies, especially when they’re as generous as my work. I used gifting very lightly as an alternative to returning barely used products in almost perfect condition. I agree that it is mostly a company issue in the way they treat returns, but as an awareness to people who don’t know and would like to be environmentally conscious, gifting something like this to someone else can help save on waste.
