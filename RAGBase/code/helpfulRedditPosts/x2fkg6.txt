LPT: When you ask someone to take a picture of you and your friends, significant other, group... ask if they can take a few pictures.

content:
Older people like me are from a time when you could use up someone's film roll taking several. Others just take the one and hand the camera back, and it might not be very good.

When you join the group for the picture, say "Take a bunch!" Then you can pose different ways. or the picture taker could take portrait and landscape photos. 

I, for one, love to be the picture taker for these. Tell them you'll take a few if they ask for "a picture." Have people get excited going through them and you may be "This guy (or woman) took all these great pictures of us!"
