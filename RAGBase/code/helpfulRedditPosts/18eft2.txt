LPT: Deal with annoying recurring thoughts

content:
Ever have those annoying thoughts or songs in your head that won't go away? Put them to work for you. Mentally associate the thought with a habit or behavior you want to change like good posture, breathing, or remembering to relax your shoulders.

That way, when the annoying thought comes back around (and believe me, it will) you can get some use out of it. Hope it helps!

EDIT: Maybe this could be modified to whenever I encounter a negative thought. Anyways, YMMV, IANAD and all that. Take care!
