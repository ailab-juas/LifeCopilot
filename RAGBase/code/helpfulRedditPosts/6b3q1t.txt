LPT: After looking at an apartment, try finding an opportunity away from the landlord to talk to the neighbors (beside, above, below) and ask about potential issues that the management wouldn't want to share with you (pests, noise, etc.)

I've been living in my new apartment for 6 months and I wish that I had done this. It's a newly renovated unit, so when I viewed it in the middle of the day it seemed clean and quiet. However, a couple days into living there I realized that my downstairs neighbor is the loudest and most inconsiderate person I've ever had the displeasure of living near (and I once lived in university apartments, so that's saying something). It's bad enough that I'm fairly certain his noise is the reason that the previous tenants in my unit decided to break their lease and move. I also realized that, probably because of this same neighbor's habit of leaving trash on his balcony, that we have a roach problem. 

I wish I had though to ask my neighbors if there were any other noisy tenants in the building or if they had experienced pest problems. It would have saved me the headache of trying to break my lease and find a new apartment.
