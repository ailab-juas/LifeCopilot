LPT: When meeting someone for the first time, try and use their name as early as possible; eg, 'Nice to meet you, [Name]'. You'll have a greater chance at recalling their name and will feel more confident in addressing them, thereby earning their respect.

I know it sounds like a no-brainer but I see this happen all the time and I've certainly experienced immediately forgetting a name I was only just given.
The only thing worse than saying 'I'm sorry, what was your name again?' is having someone say it to you.
People like hearing their own name, especially from someone they've just met. Make a habit of saying their name in subsequent sentences and you won't go wrong.
