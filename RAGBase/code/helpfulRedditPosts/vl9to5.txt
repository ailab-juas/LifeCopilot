LPT: If you drink a lot of fruit juice from the grocery store, consider taking an empty jug and pouring half a new bottle into it. Fill both to the top with water. Shake. Even diluted 1:1, you can barely tell the difference and you will get twice the value and half the sugar.

Your kids probably won't notice. If it's too watery, try a 2:1 ratio of juice to water.
