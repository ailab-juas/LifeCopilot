LPT: Angry at someone? Write a letter to them, but don't send it. It will help you understand why you're angry and keep you from overreacting emotionally.

EDIT: Wow! this is the first time I've written something on Reddit that I feel genuinely helped people. It feels amazing. I'm also so fascinated by every story posted. Best of luck to everyone with their circumstances.
 
You've all definitely motivated me to continue contributing, and I can now attest to the power of LPT's. Skol!

Edit: Some have requested a template for a criticism letter. I found this one online and it should help you get started. You don't have to use a template but it can help organize your thoughts. Sometimes its better just to let everything loose on paper at once to let the steam out.

[Writing Your Own Criticizing Letter](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Criticizing-Letter)

Begin your letter by complimenting something that the recipient 
has done that has impressed you. 

Craft a clear, concise paragraph outlining what he or she did wrong. 
Try to maintain a neutral, factual tone.
    
Acknowledge, if appropriate, that the offense may have been 
inadvertent or that you might have misunderstood something.
    
Offer solutions to prevent this mistake from happening in the future.
    
State clearly the results you would like from this letter. 
List specific actions you would like, such as correcting a problem or error, apologizing, or repairing whatever damage you feel has been done.
   
As appropriate, offer your assistance, reiterate that you hope to 
continue working with the person, and that you appreciate the other
things that he/she has done.

Summarize the letter and sign your name.
