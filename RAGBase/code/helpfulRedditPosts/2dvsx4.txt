LPT: How to balance a wobbly table (without putting stuff under the legs)

content:
Tables are built with all 4 legs the exact same length, but an un-even floor can cause one leg to be above the ground, making it unstable and wobbly.

It is mathematically proven that a stable position for the table can be found by simply rotating the table less than a quarter turn.

[Video explaining how and why here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuF-WB7mD6k)

EDIT: if that video isn't a sufficient explanation, I found the [original source here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0511490.pdf) and an [article written about it here](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-turning/)
