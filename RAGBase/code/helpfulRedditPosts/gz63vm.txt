LPT: How to remove moths and other insects from your ear canal

content:
So this happened over the weekend to somebody I know/was with. We were outside and the person started freaking out about a moth in her ear. I looked, no moth... but upon closer inspection and a flash light, indeed a moth flew deep into the ear all the way to the ear drum and was fluttering around in there stuck. A few feeble attempts at removing the thing was unsuccessful so off to the ER. They had her put her head far to the side and filled up the canal with saline fluid and the moth floated out and they were able to extract it. (Was the size of thumb nail). In talking with the people at the ER, they said it happens all the time, a really common occurrence. (Moths (Especially now in Denver), spiders, roaches) The most used method is what they did... lay on your side, ear up and very slowly fill with saline solution to have the creature crawl away and up out of the ear, then grab with tweezers) So if you find yourself with a moth or other insect deep in your ear, try that trick before heading to the hospital, it may save you some time and medical costs.
