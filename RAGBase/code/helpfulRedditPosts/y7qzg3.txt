LPT: Tell your family that two missed calls consecutively means it's an emergency.

content:
I can't always pick up to chat with my family, but I can drop whatever I'm doing if it's urgent. Similarly, if I call a family member twice immediately, I need them to pick up. Tell your family that two calls in a row means it's urgent, and don't double call if it's not urgent.
