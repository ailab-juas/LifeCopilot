LPT: never go into anything without knowing how you will get out

content:
This is my NUMBER 1 rule for my kids. At its most basic, it means don't close any door you don't know how to open (unless a trusted grownup says it's ok) and don't climb inside anything that you aren't 100% sure you will be able to get out of from the inside (eg fridges, wardrobes etc). Know where your emergency exit is and how to use it. My kids learned how to open and unlock a car door as soon as they were old enough to understand they should only do that when the engine is off.

As they get older - I will teach them that this extends much wider than just locations and physical objects. It extends to religions (any religion you can join but not physically leave safely is a cult), relationships (my kids know - you always need a bank account in YOUR NAME ONLY with enough money to live on for at least a month; possessive relationships are a HUGE red flag; you NEVER stay in a relationship where someone even loosely implies they will kill you or themselves if you leave - having the conversation early in the relationship about how, if it doesn't work out, you will respectfully go your separate ways is really important), jobs (never sign a contract with a non-compete clause that would ruin you or prevent you from earning a living wage), etc.

The only thing in your life that (I would argue) shouldn't have an emergency exit is your relationship with your kids. As they grow, they obviously need to become independent, and Once they reach adulthood, they need to be able to pull away from you entirely if they choose to - but you need to be there as a safe and stable base for them if you possibly can be.
