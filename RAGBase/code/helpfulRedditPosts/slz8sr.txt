LPT: take a video of your pet(s) now. Not just the fun stuff, also how they greet you, eat, and reaction to you coming home. You will miss those moments too.

After just recently losing our dog, we went through the thousands of photos and videos of him. Being goofy, Looking cute, running around the yard.   Its what I noticed I didn’t have videos of I missed the most: how he greeted me at the door when I got home from work, his reaction in the morning we we open the door, getting ready to feed him, and just calling his name. 

There are probably lots of great photos and videos on your phone now of your pet(s), but you will always wish for more little moments when they are gone and missed.   Take them now. Even if they seem silly to do, you won’t regret it when looking back on photos and videos when you need them most.

Edit: this goes for kids parents and friends too. Just relating my recent loss

Edit2: spelling and auto correct.
