title:
LPT: Don't ask your realtor for these referrals

content:
Don't ask a Realtor to recommend a Lawyer or Home Inspector when you are buying or selling a house.

The inspector and lawyer are your advisers on a transaction. You are paying for their advice and knowledge as they lookout for you. When this type of professional relies on real estate agents to refer them business, they are slightly more attuned to the realtors interests (like getting transactions closed) then they are to your interests (seeing potential problems ahead of time). 

No nefarious intent is needed, but a realtors livelihood depends on getting deals done. If a home inspector points out too many problems or gives an overall assessment that makes a buyer reconsider, the realtor will likely not refer the inspector in the future.

Ask anyone other than your Realtor for a recommendation, best if you get someone from the next town over so they are less likely to have relationships to any of the agents on your deal. 

Happy home buying.
