title:
YSK that most locks in the US and being used have substandard security and there are better alternatives that aren't that much more expensive if not the about the same price.

Why YSK: Is because anyone using a random padlock, or any Master Lock (especially), on sheds, sensitive company access areas, lockers at school, work, etc., can be easily picked or raked open by someone. This would cause less sound, and once open, would allow more time for the bad guy/gal to peruse your property. The same goes for a lot of door locks. Many locks installed on homes have sloppy tolerances, and again, can be picked quite easily.

For padlock replacements there are many options, e.g., an American Lock (1100 or 5200), Mako 427, M-2, Paclock (90A,90A Pro, 100, etc.) are great options for locker use, and there are other locks with more robust shackles our there, just do a bit of research. You want to make sure it's something with tight tolerances; something with security pins in each chamber and at least equipped with 5-6 pins.

If you upgrade your physical security, be sure to keep in mind, is it worth paying x amount of money on a really good lock, if someone can easily bash in a window for quick and easy access? Most burglaries use destructive means of entry, which would render your lock pointless. But, there are people out there with the know-how, and it's always good to have.

Research the locks you have been using and decide for yourself.

EDIT: Paclock 90A--not 427
