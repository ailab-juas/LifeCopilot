LPT: If you have a hard time saying 'no' to people, introduce this phrase into your daily vocabulary: 'Yes, if." This can help you have less anxiety about giving a hard No without making you bend over backwards for someone.

content:
For example, instead of answering 'No' to "Can you help me move this weekend?," try "Yes, if I can make time in my schedule and the weather isn't too hot."

(extra pro tip--if there's no way in hell you'll actually want to help, just make the conditions a little more subjective so you can easily fudge your way out.)

Warning: my old marketing professor used this when my university offered him a job in a city he didn't like. His answer to the job offer was, "Yes, if you add 30% to the base pay." They agreed to it, which is how I ended up getting this LPT in a musty room on an overly-rainy campus in the first place!
