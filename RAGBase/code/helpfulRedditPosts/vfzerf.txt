LPT: Please mail your key(s) in a padded envelope.

content:
Postal employee of 32 years here; I am NOT representing the USPS. I’m just a concerned citizen hoping to save someone some trouble when grandpa’s unique house key (that nobody ever bothered to make a copy of) gets eaten by the Postal system.

You know those plain white envelopes that everyone has a few of hanging around? Please don’t put a key in one and expect it to reach its destination. Ever.

Everything letter-shaped nowadays is processed by machines at approximately 30,000 pieces per hour. That’s slightly less than ten pieces per second. Those machines have belts that are strong enough to withstand one heck of a jam-up. They will accelerate your key straight out when the envelope stops in a sortation bin, no questions asked. Oh, and they make quite a mess while at it.

Writing “process by hand” doesn’t help, unfortunately. We legit don’t have the staffing to fish your individual letter out of the pile. In fact, the vast majority of letters are never touched by human hands or seen at all until they are delivered.

I hope this helps, and please give your grandpa a hug for me.


EDIT:  Yowza! Thank you for the awards, kind Internet strangers! I hope you are having a lovely day :)

EDIT EDIT: Thanks for all the questions and entertainment! Somewhere along the way we ended up on r/all which was kinda cool (and that, with a couple of dollars, will buy you a cup of coffee).  I think we peaked at #21? This was my very first viral anything (except maybe COVID) and I hope I did right by everyone.
