title:
LPT: Having children will not fix your relationship or your mental health

content:
Even if that's your dream, your partners dream. If you have mental issues and think this will make you happy, it won't. You need to help yourself with therapy, meditation, meds, etc. If you have a rocky relationship with your partner a child will not patch things up. It will make it even more difficult for both of you if you haven't worked on your relationship.
