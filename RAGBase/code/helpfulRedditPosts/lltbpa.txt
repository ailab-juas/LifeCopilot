YSK: if you’re sitting in your car and running it to warm up, make sure your tail pipe is clear of snow

Why YSK: If you run your car while the tailpipe is covered in snow, carbon monoxide can back up into your car and you can die, similar to running it in a garage. This was hounded into me from a young age growing up where we get a lot of snow every year, but it occurred to me that it may not be common knowledge in Texas. Stay safe out there, everyone!

Edit: I’m getting a shocking amount of angry people in the comments claiming that this isn’t true. It’s a real thing that’s on the news every single winter where I live. Here are some news stories:

This is the result of a 5 minute google. I’m not sure why some people are so angry with me over this, but I’m just trying to be helpful and spread awareness. Stay warm out there everyone!
