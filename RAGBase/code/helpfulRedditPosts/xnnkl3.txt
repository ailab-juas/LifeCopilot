LPT: Check your bill at a restaurant (US) to make sure they did not already add gratuity before you sign the bill.

content:
Went to a restaurant last night and my wife asked why the bill was so high after I added 20% gratuity. We looked at the bill and they added a 18% gratuity on it already and then gave the option for an additional gratuity. It was just the two of us.
