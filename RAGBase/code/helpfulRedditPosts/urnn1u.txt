LPT: If your vehicle has a built-in GPS and you plan to trade it in; make sure you clear your home address or any other personal info from it. Many dealers forget to do this.

I just bought a vehicle recently and the gps still had the old owners address stores in there.   I'd hate to have a random person who bought my used vehicle find out where I live.
