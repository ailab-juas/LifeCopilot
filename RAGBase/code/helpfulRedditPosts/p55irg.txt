title:
YSK that ocean creatures you may encounter on pools on a beach or the shallows can kill you if you touch them. Don't pick them up for your IG photos.

content:
Why YSK: so you don't die and you don't accidentally kill sea creatures. Don't touch unless you're a scientist or otherwise properly trained and have equipment.

Examples of marine life that can kill you: 
-  Sea Lion (bite can cause serious infection)
-  CORRECTION* Seal (a bite can cause necrosis of the flesh)
- Blue Ringed Octopus
- Box Jellyfish 

AND MANY MORE

Editing to add: 
- Cone Snail
- Stone Fish
- Various Rays
- Portuguese Man-O-War
