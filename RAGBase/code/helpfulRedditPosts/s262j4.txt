LPT: You don’t get what you deserve in life, you get what you negotiate. Always go for what you want without fear.

content:
As someone who has had to overcome my fear of rejection and fear of saying no, as well as a tendency to justify my failures because I “wasn’t trying anyway,” this realization has been really helpful for me. I mention these because they all tie in to a simple principle: *You have to be in the game to score.* A lot of the time, we may talk ourselves out of asking that attractive person out, asking for a raise, negotiating the best possible deal on a house, etc. We let our fears give us a million reasons why we shouldn’t even risk rejection. Alternatively, we may refrain from telling the waiter that they got our order wrong, or reminding a friend that they owe us money, etc. We wish to avoid conflict or ‘being rude,’ even though we’re simply advocating for ourselves. We pass up the opportunity to audition for a role in the big show, to try out for the varsity football team, or to apply for that big job. We think to ourselves, “oh, I’ll never get that,” so we don’t even try, just to avoid failure. But why live this way? Why be so passive that we never get what we want, and what we know deep down we really deserve? Wouldn’t you rather get what you want in life? You may not get what you want, but wouldn’t you rather be able to say you at least *tried* to attain what it is that makes you happy? You have to let go of your fears. You have to be assertive. To be assertive is to stand up for yourself without violating the rights of another. So ask that girl out, audition for that play, and get that $50 back from your buddy. The only way to get what you want is to go for it.

TL;DR: You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
