YSK that victims of trauma are not always able to articulate themselves convincingly, and a symptom of trauma is acceptance &amp; numbness even after the most horrific experiences.

Case in point 1) Have you ever wondered how innocent people could be convicted of crimes after being dragged through the legal system? It's traumatic, and by the time they get to court &amp; ultimately prison, no one believes them when they say, "I'm innocent! I didn't do it!"  because oddly enough that's the same thing a criminal would say.  Can you see how this would be traumatizing for an innocent person and how they could feel numb and hopeless after being dragged through the court system for years and imprisoned for years?

Case in point 2) [This woman](https://youtu.be/PTRAbshjxpE) recently surfaced in youtube videos &amp; interviews in late 2019, claiming to be among Jeffery Epstein's human trafficking victims. Many people think she is not credible, that she is just lying to seek fame. Yet she shows the same symptoms of numbness &amp; hopelessness as trauma survivors because the people who control her have payed her well monetarily while constricting her freedoms, blackmailing her into silence, and punishing her when she seeks help or freedom. In the video, the host even posits why someone would lie about something like this. She seems credible, and we need to recognize the symptoms &amp; behaviors of trauma victims/survivors.
