LPT: Is your friend blacked out? Play the 3 word game. Choose 3 random easy words and have them say it. Distract them and ask what the 3 words were 5-10 min later. If they remember 2-3 they are ok, if they don’t remember any or don’t play the game, they are blacked out.

If your friend/s are blacked out, DO NOT let them out of your sight and make sure to keep them safe, I’m sure they will thank you later.
