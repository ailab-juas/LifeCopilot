LPT: Don’t but someone a gift for their hobby unless you know what they want

content:
This LPT applies to hobbies that are very detailed or require some domain knowledge such as woodworking, sewing, music… Hobbies in which their is brand loyalty or requires knowledge of what the person already has, what the person likes, and what the person needs. 

 Instead of buying a random item for their hobby or what you think they might like, either find out what they need or ask them or buy a different gift.

When it comes to hobbies, individuals tend to know what they need or want and while it is thoughtful, it generally is wasteful as the person either will try to use it, or not want to throw it away because it’s a gift. 

Disclaimer: this LPT does not apply if you are also an enthusiast or know the hobby in details, or if the hobby is something that is not that intense.
