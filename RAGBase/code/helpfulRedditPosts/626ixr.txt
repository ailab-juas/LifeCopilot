LPT: After college, once you get the first job, start looking for a better job after a year or two. Don't stay out of loyalty.

content:
Because trust me, no company is loyal to their employees. Be respectful and professional, but loyalty in a company is rarely noticed and appreciated - unless maybe if its your dad's company.


As a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating, i found out i didn't get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year, never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school.


So i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job, it pays me almost 5 (edit: 4 is more accurate+ benefits such as health care, lunch, gym etc...) times as much as i used to. My friend from same school, with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already.


My mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me, the company only wants lower costs, loyalty has no place here.


Edit: wow, didn't expect this response, also apparently this is very common in IT sector (but applies to pretty much all industry), and i am in the IT sector :/ - still feels so unfair.


Edit 2 : as some pointed out, try not to be a "job hopper", this depends heavily on the industry you are working in though.


Edit 3: this is not a golden a rule, use your own brain, only you know your situation best - just don't let loyalty for a company ever be the biggest priority, your career should be your priority.
