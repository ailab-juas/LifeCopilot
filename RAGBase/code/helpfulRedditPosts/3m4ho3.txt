YSK that if traffic lights are out at a four way intersection, treat it like it's a four way stop!

content:
Whenever traffic lights are out, I see people just drive through like they always have a green, and it usually results in an accident.

No one seems to realize that you have to treat it like a four way stop.  Not only is it good info to know, but it's also something that can potentially save your life.
