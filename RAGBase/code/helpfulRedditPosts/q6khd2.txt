LPT: Responding to everything with negativity is a terrible habit that's easy to fall into. Internet culture rewards us for pessimism, but during personal interactions it's a huge turn-off.

I used to be an extremely negative person, and I still have a lot of trouble fighting my instinct to tear everything down. That's what gets the most attention in online spaces, complaining about or deconstructing something. This became doubly intense when I hit my angry atheist phase around 20. I actually remember alienating potential new friends by shitting on every movie/game/activity/belief system they brought up, and when they would stop texting me back I'd think "I wish this person wasn't so boring." I wanted them to play the negativity game with me. 

A cool decade later, I've figured out that they weren't boring at all. I was. Everyone knew not to float an idea my way, because I'd predictably tear it apart. I now run into people who act like I used to act, and I feel so bad for them. I wish I could tell them "hey, if you shoot down everything everyone says, nobody is going to want to say anything to you anymore."
