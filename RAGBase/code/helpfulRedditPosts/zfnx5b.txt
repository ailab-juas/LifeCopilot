title:
LPT: Talk to your coworkers about your salaries.

content:
Just happened today.  Got moved into a new position. I knew the guy who was in that position previously. We talked about our salaries and I knew what he was making. Boss gave me a 10% pay raise for this new position, but I knew that the guy who had it before me (same experience , education etc) was making 21% more. I told the boss, boss looked a little angry. He said fine, and gave me the 21% raise.

TLDR: got double the raise I was offered because I talked to my fellow employees about our salaries.
