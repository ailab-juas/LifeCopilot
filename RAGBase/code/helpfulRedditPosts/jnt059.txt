Why YSK: If you are ever on the road and feel like the person behind you is following you and you are growing concerned. Take 5 consecutive left turns (or right if youâ€™d prefer). If the car is still following you after you have done 5 consecutive turns you have basically done a full loop around the block and there is a very high chance that they infact are following you. 
You should drive straight to your local police/law enforcement agency or call emergency services.

Edit: A lot of people commenting that it should only be 4 turns. I was always told 5 as somebody could just be going around the block- but 5 turns will usually take you down a street you were just in.
