title:
LPT: When someone says they’re having surgery, don’t ask what it’s for

content:
I just had major surgery. When letting people know I’d be “out for a while for surgery,” or “on medical leave,” 90% of people asked what it was for. It put me in an incredibly uncomfortable position as mine was for an extremely personal and private reason.

If someone says they’re getting surgery or will be out on medical leave, just tell them you hope recovery goes well and leave it at that.

Edit: wow, downvote central here. Not even going to respond anymore - never knew not asking about someone's medical stuff would be so controversial.
