LPT: Easy negotiation tip anyone can do

content:
Everyone hates negotiating and want it to be over. 

One of the easiest negotiation tactics anyone can do is to offer to agree today if they give you x,y,z

"Joe, thanks for the job offer. I'm really excited. If you can give me a 10% in salary, I'll accept today"

"I'm excited about this car. If you can drop the price by $1000, I'll purchase it right now."

There's no conflict, there's no theatrics, and if that person takes it to their manager, then it's a pretty clear "if we do x, we close the deal" ask to the manager-- no annoying back and forth.
