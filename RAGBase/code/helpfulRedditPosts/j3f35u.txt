YSK: Indulging in “escapism” is normal, and important for one’s well-being.

content:
Disclaimer: The products you consume are not obligated to provide you an avenue for escapism. 


Look, life is hard. There are a lot of polarizing things going on currently, many of which are stressful. 


It’s understandable to want to get away from it all, often with some form of entertainment that allows us to tune it out. 


For many, that comes from sports. Over the last few years, sports have evolved and are less likely to provide escapism than in previous years. That’s ok, too. 


For others, escapism comes from video games, books, meditation, whatever...


Why YSK: It’s ok to want to escape. It’s ok to indulge in something that brings you happiness or decompression. You shouldn’t be made to feel bad for wanting a break. 


If your preferred method of escaping no longer allows for it, consider another medium/vehicle for achieving it. 


Take care of yourself, but also don’t take it personally if your vice of choice evolves counter to your wishes. Consider alternatives. Live and let live.
