LPT Train your dogs not to rush excitedly up to people. It could save their life

No matter how cute you think it is, all it takes is one jittery person with a gun to misinterpret their actions.

My friend's dog is super energetic and loves running up to people for pets. But one day she got out of the gate and rushed up to a random guy walking the street while we were chasing it. He got a panicked look and immediately started scrambling away and reaching for his weapon. Luckily he listened but If we weren't running behind the dog screaming "DONT SHOOT!" I shutter to think what would have happened.

After we wrangled the dog the guy was still shook up. We tried talking to him to calm him down and he told us the story of how the exact thing happened 3 years ago. He rolled up his pantleg to show a massive chunk missing in his calf from a previous attack.
