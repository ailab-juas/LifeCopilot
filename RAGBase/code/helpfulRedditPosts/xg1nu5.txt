YSK if you're not a picky buyer, the best time to shop for discounts isn't Black Friday, it's right now (maybe even a little bit earlier)

content:
Why YSK: Beginning in august, a lot of big chain stores are preparing for Christmas time, which includes getting rid of all unsold, discontinued and old products that take up precious shelf space. A lot of them hence choose to put that in liquidation (BTW, you should also know the difference between a liquidation and a special). A lot of the times it can get 50% off, I've even seen 75% off the already low liquidation price. Sure, products are unsold for a reason, but most often than not they are fully functional, just less popular than anticipated. Plus it's a low period in stores during the week so you won't have to fight for products. Anyway, good shopping!
Edit: Of course, just don't buy anything for the sole sake of getting a discount. Hoarding is a real problem for some people so be careful too!
