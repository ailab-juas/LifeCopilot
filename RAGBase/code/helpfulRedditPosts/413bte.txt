LPT: Don't tell your friends about every fallout you have with your partner

content:
Most arguments in a relationship are trivial and mean nothing - both people know that it has no effect on your overall feelings for each other, it's just an small falling-out.  There is no need to tell your friends about every little detail as they might grow resentful of your spouse from hearing everything bad that you tell them; making awkward situations when you're around both.
