title:
LPT: Start shopping for winter clothing now.

content:
Deals are to be had and if you're in an area that gets frigid during the winter months, it might be smart to stock up now.  Example: I bought a pair of winter running gloves for around $10 last June.  Looked again last November?  The same pair was $25. 

The protip transitions to summer gear in September/October.  If you plan ahead, you can save a ton of money on good clothing.
