LPT - It takes 5 minutes a day and almost no cost to maintain dental hygiene. It takes a lifetime and a lot of money to correct it.

2 minute brush and mouthwash in the AM, 2 minute brush and floss in the PM. Doing these daily can prevent all sorts of decay and bacteria issues that would be extremely costly and time consuming to correct if left unchecked.
