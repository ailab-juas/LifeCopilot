title:
LPT: When on a budget go to the Goodwill of a higher income community than your own.

content:
Goodwills are more or less a reflection of where they are located, meaning buying from a Goodwill near you is like going to a local yard sale. Where as going elsewhere can be a treasure trove. 

Bonus LPT: The more expensive the area the more stuff you'll find; often people of certain wealth do not want to be seen shopping at Goodwill and will only drop items off.

Edit: Goodwill was meant to be interchangeable with thrift stores in general. Goodwill was just the one I picked.

Edit: From reading posts it appears Goodwill is not as benevolent as they seem. If you would like to donate, research how your Goodwill or other thrift stores deal with their donations and wear the money goes. 

Edit: Many communities may have distribution center in which the items brought in are spread to other locations. 

Edit: I know the LPT may not work for every store or location, however I am posting from experience and just wanted to share something I noticed. (My vote, look anyway it's a thrift store, you never know what you'll find. Plus the second LPT still has a chance to work as it means less competition.)

Thank you everyone for your comments (positive and negative) You guys are awesome!
