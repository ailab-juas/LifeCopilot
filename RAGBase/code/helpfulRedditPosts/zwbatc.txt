YSK Addiction doesn’t stop just because you get pregnant or have a child/ren

content:
Why YSK: People have this idea that if an addict has a child they have to choose the child or drugs and it’s not that simple. People don’t choose drugs over anything. That’s not how addiction works. 

If having children was the cure to addiction, everyone would have done it, and sooner, too. 

This adds to the stigma of addiction. 9 times out of 10 addicts have faced serious trauma and the addiction is a ‘symptom’ if you will, of that trauma. The addiction is used to get as far away from that trauma as possible.

Instead of spending energy on judging addicts, we should be using that energy to offer resources. 

We have a hard time understanding things we haven’t been through. And it’s impossible to know what you would do in a situation you’ve never been in. Please remember that and be kind. There’s ALWAYS more to learn.

ETA: babies ARE not born addicted. They’re born dependent. 
Addiction has certain behaviors. It’s doing something YOU know is harmful. Babies do not pop out of the womb, call their dealers, stop by their moms purses on the way out to steal money, and then go buy drugs. 
They don’t even take the substances themselves. 
But this is not about a woman doing drugs while pregnant. This was about a man not stopping drugs actually.
