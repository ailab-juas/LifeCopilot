title:
LPT: If You Know Someone with Cancer

content:

1. Don't buy tacky cancer gifts during the holidays,  or ever. You know yhe bags, t-shirts,  hats, and stickers.  They don't want to think about cancer.

2. Don't tell them about a friend of a friend who beat cancer. Each person's cancer is different,  there's no cookie cutter treatment.  You can rest assure they're trying every treatment possible.

3. Don't bring it up unless they do.  Their lives are constantly bombarded with the subject from appointments and treatments along with stupid tv commercials.

4. Call and check in often,  see if they need anything. Even if they say they don't,  they need you!
