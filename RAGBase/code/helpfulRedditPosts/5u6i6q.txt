LPT: hide your files by using an internet explorer icon. No one will click on it.

This helped me out hiding my files when people searched for them. No one suspects it.

Edit: if someone sees you have hidden files on they will immediately suspect you.
Or if you have an app that hides it.

Edit 2: Thanks for the frontpage on r/LifeProTips
