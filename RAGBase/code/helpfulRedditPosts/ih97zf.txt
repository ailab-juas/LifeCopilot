LPT: If you ever get into a car accident and you or someone in your car is injured, especially if there’s blood, take photos before it gets cleaned up.

As a disclaimer, obviously it’s a very hectic situation and definitely only do it if you can without unnecessarily endangering anyone.

But my wife and I got in a car accident last year. I split my head open and got a concussion and got staples in my head. Head injuries bleed a lot, and my wife was smart enough to pull out her phone and snap a couple of gruesome pictures of me with blood sheeting down my face.

Fast forward to now, and my wife mentioned sort of off-hand to our lawyer that we had pictures from the scene. He immediately took them and sent them to the adjuster and today we got their new offer which had almost doubled the money we’d take home.

It’s a bright spot in an otherwise shitty, shitty year, so if you find yourself in an unfortunate situation like that, take those pics and make the most of it.

Edit: As a couple of users pointed out, this is geared more toward Americans. I’m not an expert in the law of any country, but it seems in the EU this may be either illegal or at least unnecessary.

Edit 2: Lot of confusion, so to be clear, I’m not talking about blood on the vehicle (although you should also take pics of that), I’m referring to blood on your person.
