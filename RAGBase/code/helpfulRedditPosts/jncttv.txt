LPT: Don't work too hard and think that you will enjoy after 50s. After 50s your health will be bad, your kids will be old and there won't be the same fun. Instead have fun with Family whenever you get chance. Working too hard can be bad for your family life too.

Although this is comes from a 21 year old kid, I experienced it first hand because of my workaholic father.

Edit: I am not saying that one shouldn't work hard. Overworking and sacrificing your life isn't really worth it. If I say working hard is bad then I am contradicting myself.
