LPT: starting a conversation with “you always” or “you never” is a sure fire way to trigger someone’s defense mechanism

content:
To dodge an argument episode, be specific. Try: “when you do this, I feel…” or “this is how I see it, how do you see it?” Seek to understand, not to be right.
And it wouldn’t hurt to ask yourself if you ever do that thing too. Sometimes we recognize that thing only because we have done it too. Be the example. Be the change.
