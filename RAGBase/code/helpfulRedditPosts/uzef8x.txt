YSK that the majority of Ivy League schools in the US offer free tuition to students whose families earn $65k per year or less

content:
Why YSK: These schools often seem overwhelmingly out of reach as they're known for their astronomical tuitions, and this can be a deterrent to interested parties when they're deciding whether or not to apply.

All 8 Ivy League US schools offer comprehensive financial aid packages, and the income cap for some is much higher (Stanford's being $150k).

Edit: I'm seeing a lot of commenters correctly pointing out that there are additional barriers or hurdles to attending these schools beyond tuition, particularly for students who fall under lower income brackets. You're absolutely right.

My intention in sharing this information was not to suggest that if you don't have a lot of money, you can breeze right into Harvard. A lot of students from lower income families, as a direct result, have less access to resources, and less time and money to expend on preparation and marketability. 

What I am saying is that it's been done before, whatever the odds. If even one student who once dreamed of attending an ivy league school is able to achieve that, in part with the help of this information, then I believe it's useful for it to be public knowledge.

If I can offer any advice to interested students, it's this- there are tons of resources out there for you. I let a lack of funding hold me back in many ways when I was thinking about college, whether tuition, or even application fees. Talk to your advisor! Their job is to help connect you with resources and funding, but they can't help you if you don't tell them what you need. Go get that bag, you are worth it. 

Cheers!
