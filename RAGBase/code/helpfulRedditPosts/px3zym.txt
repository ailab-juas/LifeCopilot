LPT: When you feel like criticizing someone or complaining about someone, think of these 3 questions: Does it need to be said? Does it need to be said, by me? Does it need to be said, by me, right now?

content:
If you can answer yes to all of those questions go right ahead. If you answer no to any of them, best to keep your mouth shut. This is something I read long ago from a daily email service and it has stuck with me. EDIT: This comes from Craig Ferguson.

EDIT: I was just quoting this from someone else, so yes, obviously you can skip to the last question.


Also I wanted to italicize certain words but don't know how to do that so instead used commas, sorry if it looks stupid.
