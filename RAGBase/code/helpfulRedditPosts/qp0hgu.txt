LPT: brushing teeth using LEFT hand! (If you're a right-handed person and vice versa)

content:
Try this and you would find tremendous effect after a week. It is nothing other than unlocking a different dimension in your brain, bringing you closer to ambidexterity. I felt terribly at awe and clumsy at first but now not only am I able to brush teeth, wash dishes, using chopsticks, writing, etc. by the use of left hand!

You would never know how much this habit has to offer, it would come in handy in the case you break something (bones for example).

Edit: Wow i did not expect this to blow up. Thanks for the upvotes and awards kind strangers!
