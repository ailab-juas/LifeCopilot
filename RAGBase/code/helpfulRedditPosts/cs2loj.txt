title:
YSK that when someone expresses their stress or complains to you then 9/10 times, they just need someone to listen.

content:
Not for you to lecture and shit about how they could've done this or done that, shut up and listen. Be supportive. It'll go a long way.
Edit:
This post blew up kidnapped and got a lot of comments, it's nice knowing that people feel the same way. I'll reply to all the comments onece I am back. If you need someone to listen, my dms are open. :)

Edit 2.0: people are saying g why don't you fix their problem, what I am trying to say is that listen and help, just don't make them feel Ashu of telling their stress.
