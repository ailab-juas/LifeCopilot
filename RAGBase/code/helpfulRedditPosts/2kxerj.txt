LPT: Avoid any company that makes you pay them to sell their products or recruit new members. It's a pyramid scheme.

content:
Companies like this try to make you believe that you're a "business owner". That's not true. You're just their customer. It'd be best to avoid any company that does this. This includes Amway, Arbonne, Vemma, Shakeology, "It Works!", Mary Kay, and Doterra.
