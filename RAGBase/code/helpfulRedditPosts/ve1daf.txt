LPT: a wet oven mitt is no longer an oven mitt.

content:
Water transfers heat a lot faster than dry fabric. If you ever get an oven mitt wet, donâ€™t use it to pull anything out of the oven unless you want the heat transferred directly to your hand. 

Thankfully this trick has saved me from any nasty burns.
