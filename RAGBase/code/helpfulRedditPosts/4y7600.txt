LPT If you're going to meet a group for the first time, get there as early as you can

content:
By getting there early

-you won't be overwhelmed by 20 people, only a few are usually there early.

-you will have more time to introduce yourself to the host(and close friends) and make a lasting impression

-you will be able to greet people as they come in and have a better chance to talk to everybody. 

-Newcomers who get there later might see you as someone already on the inside of the group and this will raise your stock and give you more opportunity

-if you can drink, you will have time to talk to people before they get drunk and have more chances to be remembered once again 

-it will also give you more flexibility as to when to leave, you can stay late or leave early. 

-in the end, you will enjoy the experience much more if you get there early.
