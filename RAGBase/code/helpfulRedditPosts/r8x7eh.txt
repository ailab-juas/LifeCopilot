LPT: Never tell the recruiter how much money you make and never be the first to give a number

content:
A lot of recruiters will ask what salary you are interested in, partly to see if you are within their budget but also this is a huge opportunity for you to sell yourself short, especially if you don't fully understand the scope of the role yet.

Instead, say something like "I think I would need to hear a bit more about the scope of this role and expectations before discussing compensation for it.  Can we revisit this discussion after I have had a chance to talk with the team and determine whether I am a good fit?" - they might immediately ask you what else you want to know about the role here so be prepared.

Recruiters will frequently ask how much you currently make as well, again, partly to see if you fall within their range and again a huge opportunity for them to take advantage of you.  I would recommend never answering this.  Instead say something like:

"I would prefer not to disclose that at this point in the process.  I would prefer to have a more comprehensive salary based on my skills, what I can offer to the team, and company benefits.  Is there a certain budget that you had in mind?"

This does a few different things.  For one, the recruiter doesn't know what you make now - so if your current compensation is below their range, they cant just offer you the minimum or even attempt to match your current salary.  You're also asking their budget range to get a better idea of what this company is comfortable offering as well as their benefit package.  Most companies will let you know what their benefits early on in the hiring process.

TL;DR
Don't tell the recruiter your salary!  It might be way below what they were going to offer you in the first place and will immediately minimize your negotiation attempts!
