title:
YSK Storing your potatoes next to your onions will make them go bad faster

content:
Why YSK: I just recently learned that onions produce a gas that makes your potatoes sprout eyes and go bad much faster.  I had to get a new bag ever 2 weeks before I moved them, now that they are located elsewhere I'm going over a month and a half and they are still fine.  Don't waste your potatoes, locate them away from your onions.
