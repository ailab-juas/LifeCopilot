YSK: You are almost always responsible for rear-ending someone, regardless of the circumstances.

Why YSK: If you rear end somebody the insurance companies and courts will tell you plainly, "You could have been further back and avoided the accident." About the only time this won't apply is if your dash cam records someone cutting you off without a blinker and then immediately brake checking you into a collision. Even then, if you ride someone's ass that just cut you off to really show em how angry you are, they can just slam on the brakes and the insurance companies will argue you had all the time in the world to slow down and increase that distance but you didn't. 

There is a \*\*three second rule\*\* for cars; you mark a landmark or a line on the road and count from zero. If you get to the landmark before you counted to three, you're too close. 

Keep in mind these are bare minimums. This is the amount of time you have if you see the impending obstacle immediately. If you're on your phone, that's it for you. If you're tailgaiting so you can pass someone on the right, you're toast. 

My favorite bumper sticker was one that read, "If you can read this, you're one second from paying for my new car." 

It's not ironic, it's a fact.
