LPT: Let your daughters paint your nails, have a tea party with them, and help them set up a lemon-aid stand. Before you know it they will be too old for any of that.

Edit - For anyone triggered by this, feel free to mentally rephrase it as: whatever it is your children want to do when they’re young, do it with them before they’re too old to want to do it anymore. You’ll never get those years back.

And yes, \*lemonade.

Edit 2 - For people asking "Who's triggered by this and why?"

1. Those who believe, since I referenced the daughters I'm raising, that I am insinuating son's can't do these things, or more generally that sons don't need love and attention from their parents.
2. Those who infer that I'm saying there is a hard cut-off date when these activities can no longer occur.
3. Then there's the one, I only recall seeing 1 this aggressive, who is not comfortable enough with his own masculinity to engage in these "feminine activities" since  it will make him appear to be an "emasculated twink".
