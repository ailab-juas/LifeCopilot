LPT: Recovered my stolen car by checking the city's transportation website for parking violations and tracked the address.

content:
My car was stolen a few days ago and since I live in a city with constant street sweeping (and two hour parking limits everywhere), I knew there was a chance it had been ticketed. Sure enough, a day after it was stolen, a ticket popped up. I got the exact location and within hours I was at the address and my car was there. I called the police, they searched my car, and then released it to me.
