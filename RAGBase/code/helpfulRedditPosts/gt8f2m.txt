LPT: Easy way to get any bug out of your room

content:
If you have ever had a big bug buzzing around your head while you are trying to sleep or study. Here is an easy way to get them to leave. 

Open the door and turn off all the lights inside the room. Then when you turn on lights outside the door the bugs will naturally follow the light and leave your room. This has helped me so many times in the past, I really wanted to share this to help others. Obviously the bug will be in the other room now, but at least itâ€™s not bothering you anymore.
