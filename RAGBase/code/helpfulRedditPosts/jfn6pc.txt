YSK: If you have a friend who doesn't like celebrating for their birthday it is not your job to "break their shell". If you really want to make them feel special and you're a close friend, plan a day alone with them and see what they say, anything more should always be planned with the person there.

Why YSK: Some people just don't like big celebrations with everyone staring and feeling obligated to say hi to everyone. It's very overwhelming especially for people on the spectrum. Try to always get said friends input on plans. Never surprise them with a grandiose gathering. Planning ahead and asking for permission will show a sense of understanding/empathy and win you some brownie points at least.
