LPT: Use your phone’s autocorrect settings to create macros for commonly-used, annoying-to-enter stuff like email addressees, weird names, and common phrases

content:
For example, “j@“ autocorrects to my full email address, and “1n” autocorrects to my street address. Saves loads of time and frustration. 

On iPhone: Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text Replacement &gt; + &gt; enter the full phrase (full email address) and shortcut (like “j@“)
