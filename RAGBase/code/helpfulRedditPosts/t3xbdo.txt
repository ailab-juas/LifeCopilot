LPT: if you're in a hurry and something goes wrong (e.g. can't find your keys) resist the urge to get angry and focus on clearly thinking. It's practice for real crisis

content:
This is something I learned I think because I despised acting like my father in a crisis.  He blows his top and is more a problem and then can't fix simple things in front of him.  When I am late and can't find my keys I want to get angry but I resist the urge and concentrate on thinking clearly to figure out where they must be.  If you make a habit of this, you'll deal better with unexpected things in life and if a real crisis occurs you'll be set up to think clearly and react productively.
