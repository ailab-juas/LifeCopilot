LPT: If you're in any kind of communal food situation, here's a simple rule to prevent 90% of all fights: "Never eat the first or last of anything you didn't buy."

content:
In other words, if you see something in the fridge or the pantry unopened, and you didn't buy it, you don't get to open it or have the first piece / bowl / whatever (unless it's offered); and if you see something in the fridge or pantry that has only one serving left that you didn't buy, leave it alone (again, unless it's offered); but you can scarf anything in between. This prevents any one person from eating food that was being saved for a special occasion or from having that last bowl of ice cream you knew was waiting for you. 

I've lived in roommate situations for most of my adult life, and this rule has saved me from a thousand angry fights.
