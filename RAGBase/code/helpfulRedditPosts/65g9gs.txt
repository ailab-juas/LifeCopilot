LPT: Learn how to convince people by asking questions, not by contradicting or arguing with what they say. You will have much more success and seem much more pleasant.

Edit: want to highlight my encouragement to learn this as an extra tool for persuasiveness. Not the only tool, nor one that works in every situation, especially if used poorly. Just as sure as you can hammer a nail with a wrench, you can ask a question that is argumentative and contradicting.

On a side note, this is my first post on Reddit and I am humbled by the number of up-votes. Thanks!
