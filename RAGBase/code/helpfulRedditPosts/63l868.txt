YSK: Airbnb charges a 3% Currency Conversion Fee

content:
I'm hoping Reddit can help point out something I'm missing here, or at the very least that I can point out a practice some folks may not know.

When travelling overseas and using Airbnb for stay, the host will charge in their local currency - let's say in Switzerland, it would be in Francs.

For those of you with "no foreign transaction fee" credit cards in the US or elsewhere, you would prefer to pay in the local currency and let Visa/Mastercard do the conversion for you at market rates. However, **Airbnb will force you to pay in USD and charge you a 3% currency conversion fee**.

This appears to be against the rules of [Mastercard](http://www.mastercard.com/elearning/dcc/docs/DCC%20Guide%2020.02.17%20EN.pdf) and [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/visa-acceptance-guide-for-lodging-and-cruise-line-merchants-vbs-%2001.MAR.16.pdf).

&gt; The cardholder must be offered a choice to accept or decline DCC and must actively choose the DCC
option prior to the merchant processing the transaction. 

Is this legal?
