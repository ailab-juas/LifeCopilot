LPT: If you want to cancel your Adobe subscription without having to pay the cancellation fee, tell them you're cancelling because you have a new Adobe subscription that your work is paying for.

content:
I recently cancelled two Adobe subscriptions over the phone and didn't have to pay a cancellation fee because I told them at my new job they're paying for a CC subscription for me to use. They didn't ask for the email associated with the work CC account, just the emails from the accounts I wanted to cancel.
