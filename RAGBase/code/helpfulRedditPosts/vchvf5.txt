LPT: Don’t skip out on an experience simply because friends are preoccupied. It’s better to enjoy an experience alone then miss out entirely.

content:
Too many times I’ve put plans on the back burner simply because my friends weren’t available for said plans. I recently encountered this dilemma when I wanted to travel to a city I’d never been to and had no friends available for the trip. Instead of abandoning the idea, I decided to book a solo trip for myself and had a blast exploring the city for the weekend. The trip was eye opening. It made me realize what I had been missing out on because friends were preoccupied. Waiting for someone’s availability to free up in order to experience something you’ve wanted to do is limiting. Juggling schedules can sometimes lead to plans never coming to fruition, leaving you with FOMO.

Is there an upcoming concert you’re interested in or a movie you’ve been wanting to see? If nobody is available, go alone. You’ll have a better experience than missing out completely.

EDIT: THAN :) If you successfully experience something alone **then** miss out entirely, please let us in on that secret.
