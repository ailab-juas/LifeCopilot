title:
LPT: When bringing food to first responders, bring something in a wrapper not pizza.

content:
Please don't think me ungrateful. The few times people have brought food out to major situations it has been a life saver. However, if at all possible stay away from pizza and catering platter setups. If you give us something with a wrapper (cheeseburgers, tacos, burritos, etc) it will give us a barrier between the crap we've been sifting through and our food. 

Seriously though, thank you. You can't know how huge it is when this stuff happens to get warm food. 

Disclaimer: I'm not currently involved in any of the major efforts, just been there before.
