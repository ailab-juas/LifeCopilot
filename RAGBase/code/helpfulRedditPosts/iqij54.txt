YSK: If you accidentally delete all your work on a Google software (docs, sheets, etc) there's a way to easily recover your work

content:
Why YSK: I have this problem a lot where I would accidentally wipe my document and return to docs home screen "permanently" erasing it.

If this has happened to you, just do this:

1. Go back to the document you wish to recover
2. At the top of the screen, next to the "Help" button, there's a clickable link that takes you to your version history (usually labelled "Last edit was on ///")
3. You should be able to view all the changes and edits you made every time you opened the document while giving you the option to restore that version.
