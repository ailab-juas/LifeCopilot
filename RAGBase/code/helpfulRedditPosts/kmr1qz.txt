LPT: After your wedding, ask the florist for a list of the flower in your spouseâ€™s bouquet.

content:
I did it and have been able to buy my wife flower arrangements with the same types of flowers that were in her wedding bouquet on special wedding anniversaries (e.g., 1st, 5th, 10th, the year we became parents, etc.).  I also keep a photo of the bouquet to show the florist.  She was so surprised the first time I did it.  It went over really well. She immediately recognized that all of the flowers had been in her bouquet.
