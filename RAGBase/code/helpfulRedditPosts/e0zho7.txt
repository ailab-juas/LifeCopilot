title:
YSK being able to purchase something is NOT the same as being able to afford it

content:
Being able to purchase something means you literally have the money and/or credit to buy it. Being able to AFFORD something means you can buy it *comfortably* without running into financial difficulties.


Many people just resort to the former, but that’s not the smartest way to spend your money. You’ll quickly find yourself struggling to save money and you’ll be compromising your long-term financial or retirement plans, if any.


Know your budget, know the value of what you’re buying (price =/ value), and make sure you can *comfortably* buy it.
