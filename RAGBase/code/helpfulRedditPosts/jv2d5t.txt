YSK: if your friends and family tell you you're being conned, you're almost certainly being conned.

 **Why YSK:**  

Con  artists are professional predators. It doesn't make you weak or stupid  to fall for a con. It just means you had unmet needs that a professional  was able to spot and exploit for personal gain. Again, you're not weak  or stupid. You're probably just out of your league because you're up  against a professional.

If your  friends and family tell you this new person in your life might be con  artist, immediately stop giving that person money, information and  access. If, in response, they try to convince you that everyone else is  lying, that only they can be trusted, you can be certain they are, in  fact, taking advantage of you. "Everyone is lying except me" is NOT a  normal friendship dynamic and is very strong evidence you're talking to a  criminal. You will make other friends. There are plenty of fish in the  sea.
