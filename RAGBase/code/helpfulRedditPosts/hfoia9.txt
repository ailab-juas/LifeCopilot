YSK That Punishing Your Child After They Cause An Accident Does Not Make Them Want To Be Careful Next Time, It Makes Them More Afraid To Do Anything

content:
Obviously this does not apply for every situation, as "accident" can vary between severity, timing, and the situation at hand.

But this isn't about if a child does something heinous such as stealing candy from another child or start a fight or acting up. This is about **when your child does something by accident or out of their control**.

We're talking "Oops they dropped a plate and it broke" or "I don't understand this concept and I say stuff without thinking about it".

By punishing your child after such mistakes, their takeaway from the punishment is less likely to be "I did something they didn't like so I have to be careful" and more "My parent got angry at me for this or that so I shouldn't do X or Y anymore".

I'm not saying don't discipline your child, but take the time for your child to understand what they did, why they did it, and what they can do to avoid doing it. It's a learning process, and every bit of what they learn now will carry with them into the future.

Don't punish, teach.

Sincerely, an adult still traumatized by their parents punishing them frequently at a young age.
