LPT: After assembling IKEA furniture, tape the key to the underside so that you can easily find it in the future, if you need to tighten screws or disassemble it.

content:
My desktop chair's armrest was coming loose, so I looked under it to find out which screw needed to be tightened. The original key that I had used to assemble the chair was taped to the underside, making it quick and easy for me to tighten the screw.

Funniest thing was that I had completely forgotten that I had done it, and was stunned at how smart of a trick it was

EDIT: Yeah I have a toolbox.... This trick made it so I didn't have to go find my allen-keys and I could just fix the armrest right then and there.
