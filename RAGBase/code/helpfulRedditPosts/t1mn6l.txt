LPT: Someone asks you to help them move. I've always had 2 rules. 1. Have everything packed. 2. Have a plan.

I have a truck, so obviously I get asked a lot to help people move. Early on I never realized how bad it was. From my experience, once I laid the ground rules above. It's been smoother and has happened faster. Nobody wants to sit there while you pack your boxes, and do nothing. Have your stuff together and get it done quick. I'm here to do work, not lollygag.
