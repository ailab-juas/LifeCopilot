LPT: If you’re ever considering getting rubber floor mats for a home gym, check for rubber horse stall mats instead.

content:
Companies know that more and more people are making home gyms, so the rubber floor mats to prevent damage at home are greatly upcharged.  What people don’t know is that a lot of farms line their stalls with a rubber mat for the horses.  It helps keeps the horses from standing on a hard floor, just like a human would want, and they can be cleaned off easily.  

You can generally find high quality mats for a fraction of the price, and they’re the same type of flooring that you’d need anyways!

Edit:  As some have mentioned, you might want to let any mats you buy “off gas” for a bit, but this will happen naturally if you can leave them in your garage first.  Similar to how you’d leave a shipped mattress to off gas.  These are also generally thicker than a cheap gym mat (3/4” is common for use in stalls) so bring a friend to help carry it to your vehicle or into your home, if needed.  That’s a workout itself!
