LPT: If customer service/care isn't entirely helpful, or seems not 100% knowledgeable, politely end the conversation, then call back at another time. To no fault of their own, some employees may not be fully educated on your issue.

Same goes for non-purchase related phone calls. I find that humans can often give incomplete or wrong information. Calling back may give another person the chance to help with more "tools" at their disposal.
