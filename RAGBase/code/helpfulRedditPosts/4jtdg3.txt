LPT: When making tacos put the cheese in first, it will melt and hold the taco together while eating.

content:
Tacos fall apart after the first bite but not if you get the cheese all melty first. Put it in the bottom, meat on top, whatever else after. The cheese will cling to the shell and hold it all together maintaining greater taco integrity.

Edit: I have hurt so many peoples feelings with this. You should all just calm down and have ~~a taco~~ Mexican food. I would like to thank the nice people though. Thumbs up to you.
