LPT: If you live in a shady area or city, consider carrying around a "decoy wallet" with a few dollars of cash, some business cards and a fake I.D. in case you ever get mugged or robbed.

I didn't want to make the title too long, but I live in a college town that gets kind of shady at night. I do my laundry at the local laundromat (it's cheap and I use spare change) and was doing it in the evening once and was stopped at my car by a thug demanding my wallet. I reached to my back right pocket and pulled out my decoy wallet (I only carried it when I thought I'd need it most) and gave him that and he just jogged off. It had maybe $8, a few old business cards and some old gift cards in it. Not sure how useful it'll really be, but odds are they'll just take it and leave.

Edit: Upon reading some comments, I should have left out the whole "fake ID" bit, as I know that's actually illegal in and of itself. So consider that part redacted.

Edit 2: Okay before I see another dozen comments regarding carrying a weapon, I can't. I'm under 21 and live in a relatively strict state when it comes to carrying laws.
