LPT: if you receive great service at a restaurant and want to leave a positive review, be sure to mention the servers name. It's a small gesture but will really help them when it comes to negotiation a pay rise or help them stand out at a job interview.

I worked at a pub and got mentioned by name in a review. My manager was not really around so cannot see the work I do but after seeing the positive review he was really happy with me.

I also used this at a job interview when they asked for an example of when I have delivered great customer service.

Edit: this is UK and I didn't ask for a raise or was rewarded with one, I'm just saying never ask for a raise unless you can back it up with a reason why you should get one. Those positive reviews are worth a lot especially to independent/small businesses... You get companies that pay thousands for fake reviews and it also get companies that sue people literally take them to court for leaving a bad review and they sometimes win thousands in compensation!

I have read your comments and I get it you can't get a raise as a server (hopefully that is just USA)... my point was that regardless of where you work reviews are valuable and make you stand out... So leaving a review can make a person stand out and even help them with their career.
