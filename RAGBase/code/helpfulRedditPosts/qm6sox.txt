LPT: Understanding that not everyone is going to like you is extremely rewarding. Expecting everyone to like you can cause alot of unnecessary stress and anxiety.

 There will always be people who exist who don't like who you are. It DOESN'T mean there is anything wrong with you. And most likely it's their own personal issues.

 Be who you are no matter what, changing yourself to be accepted will cause more depression than its worth.
