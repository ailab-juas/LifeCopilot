LPT: Being alone and feeling like you have no one to talk to is still better than constantly being around toxic/ negative people

content:
This is referring to individuals who are able to leave those toxic/ negative people. 

Toxic/ negative people are like an anchor to you and your life will pretty much be slow torture when you’re with them. 

Most people will find it easier to eventually talk to new people or to seek help but this is a lot harder to do so when you’re with toxic/ negative people for various reasons. 

As hard as it is for some to leave these type of people, your life will be far better without them. 

*Trigger Warning* - From personal experience I can say that for some people with suicidal and/or self-harming thoughts…etc. personally I feel that it may be that these toxic/negative people are a temporary ‘lifeline’ so this may not apply to everyone, for other reasons too.
