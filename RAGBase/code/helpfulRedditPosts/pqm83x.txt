LPT: A candle will keep you alive in a stranded car out in the cold

content:
Here in Buffalo we get bad storms that sometimes leave people stranded in their cars. Even with blankets once the car dies you’re going to get cold. All you need to keep your body alive is a candle! Once you run outta gas you need to crack one of the windows ever so slightly and light your candle. The warmth from the flame won’t make you toasty but it will also keep the cabin from getting to a point at which you could freeze. Obviously you should have blankets/gloves/water as well but most people I know don’t know about the candle, and you never know what just might save your life.

Edit: you will obviously need a match or lighter to light said candle
