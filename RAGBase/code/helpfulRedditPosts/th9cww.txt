LPT: I'm 43. By your late 20's/early 30's, make sure physical fitness becomes an absolute top priority.

I started a dedicated fitness regimen when I was 28 to improve my odds with a girl. Didn't work on the girl. What did work was that the routine stuck. Now pushing my mid-forties, I can't believe where I am physically compared to many others my age. Also scary is how they regard physical deterioration as an inevitability. It isn't. Get started now. It will be one of the greatest gifts you'll ever give yourself.
