title:
LPT: Dollar Store pregnancy tests are as sensitive, or even more sensitive than the brand name strips

content:
Pregnancy tests measure hormones in the urine.

Some tests can measure as low as 15mIU, while others need at least 50 to get a positive.

[This chart](http://www.fertilityplus.com/faq/hpt.html) displays common brands and their sensitivity levels.

As it turns out, the Dollar Tree brand can detect as low as 20 mIU, while some of the more expensive brands need 40-50.

If you are anything like my wife, when trying to get pregnant, you will test 2-3 times a day, every day during the optimal time. I realized I would go broke buying those two packs of first response or ept for $18, so I went to Dollar Tree and bought 20 tests. They actually keep them near the cashier-- apparently people steal these things.

The Dollar Tree brand got positives when the first responses did not. Blood tests at the doctor later confirmed the pregnancy.

I did go out at the end and spend $20 on those digital ones that have the readout that says "pregnant" - she wanted that as a memento.
