LPT: When baking cookies, take them out when just the sides look almost done, not the middle. They'll finish baking on the pan and you'll have soft, delicious cookies.

content:
A lot of times baking instructions give you a bake time that leaves them in until the cookies are completely done baking. People then let the cookies rest after and they often get over-baked and end up crunchy, crumbly, or burnt. 

So unless you like gross hard cookies, TAKE YOUR COOKIES OUT OF THE OVEN WHILE THE CENTER IS STILL GOOEY. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE BRINGING HARD COOKIES TO POTLUCKS WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEIR COOKIES ARE ACTUALLY BURNT.

Edit: Okay this is getting wayyyyy more attention than I thought it would. I did not know cookies could be so extremely polarizing. I just want to say that I am not a baker, nor am I pro at life. I like soft cookies and this is how I like to get them to stay soft. With that being said, I understand that some people like hard cookies, chewy with a crunch, and many other varieties. There’s a lot of great cookie advice being given throughout this thread so find which advice caters to the kind of cookies you like and learn up! If not, add your own suggestion! Seeing a lot of awesome stuff in here. 

I am accepting of all kinds of cookies. I just know some people have hard cookies when they wish they were soft so I thought I’d throw this up!
