title:
YSK the holidays can be the best time to apply for jobs

content:
If you interview with a company between Thanksgiving and New Years, you might not hear back any time soon. That's alright. The 'decision makers' may be out of the office, or they may not have the money to make an offer until January (when the new company budget kicks in). 

However, this can also be the best time to apply. 

Don't wait until the start of the new year, when everyone else is putting in applications. Start now. Additionally, a portion of the other applicants will be unreachable during the holidays. This, when combined with the lowered competition, makes you stand out as a much more dependable candidate. ([Source.](http://www.vmsolu.com/career-search-tips-for-the-holiday-season/))
