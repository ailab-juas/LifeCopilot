YSK: Bandage shears can easily cut through welded plastic and otherwise difficult to open plastic packaging

Basic [bandage shears](http://lgcdn.hockeymonkey.com/80A850/hockey/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/1000x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/h/o/homerun-mueller-sports-medicine-20302-bandage-shears.jpg) can easily cut through the plastic that many consumer products come in.

Most bandage shears have small teeth along one arm and these teeth enable the scissors to easily cut tough plastic without a great deal of force or without leaving sharp, jagged edges behind.

They're readily available on Amazon for a few bucks and make great all-around package opening devices.
