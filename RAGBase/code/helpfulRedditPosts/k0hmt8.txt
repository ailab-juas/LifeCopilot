LPT: Riding a bike at night with a headlight? Please do your fellow riders, walkers, drivers, etc. the kindness of checking to make sure your light is pointed diagonally down to light the ground in front of you and not shining into everyone else’s eyes.

content:
Also if your light has a setting that isn’t insane strobe flashing (especially the headlight), please choose that. Some people do have epilepsy, no sense giving them a seizure.
