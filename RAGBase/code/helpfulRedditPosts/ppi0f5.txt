LPT: Before your kids go to college or move out, educate them on what a pyramid scheme/ MLM looks and feels like.

When I was in college I was nearly sucked into a MLM (Amway). 

The guy recruiting was a snake, setting up the meetings under the guise of an “entrepreneur club”. It was on campus and felt safe; some girl I had befriended in my class asked me to go with her to a club meeting. Other kids were there and we were all interested in starting our own businesses. 

The first couple meetings he talked about how to start a business and would give us free products from “his own business”. Not until about the 5th meeting did I learn it was Amway, once they had convinced me “you’re going to buy this stuff at the store anyway so why not make money off of yourself?”. 

I was clueless and had no idea what was about to happen. Thank god I discussed this with my friends, one of which was smart enough to explain to me what was really going on. I stopped going to the meetings and was harassed by the guy, and the girl who asked me to come to this meeting.

I was shocked when I told my mom what had happened and she explained something similar had happened to her when she was younger. I felt for a moment my parents had failed me. 

I won’t let my future children leave the house without telling them this story and how to spot the warning signs!

Edit: for all the people saying that it’s not my parents fault but mine because I’m stupid or lack common sense, just look at the comments. Look at all the people just on this post who can relate. I’m not saying it’s my parents fault I almost got into this, but when you’re young and not yet hardened from the world, it’s nice to know exactly *what* you’re looking to avoid out there. I hope this post has helped!
