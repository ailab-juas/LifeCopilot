title:
YSK Drinking soda throughout the day can erode your teeth

content:
Used to have decent teeth.  Did an internship with free soda one summer and then gaps formed and had to get it fixed.

If you do still drink soda, ~~brush teeth afterward~~ or at least rinse with water or drink with straw

Or drink tea.  In Japan they regularly drink cold barley, oolong, black, and green teas

edit: also avoid sports drinks https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/news/20060309/gatorade-tough-on-teeth#1
