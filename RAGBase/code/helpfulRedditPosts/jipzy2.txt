YSK if you have a dietary requirement, tell the foodbank— we WILL try to accommodate you.

This goes for everything. coeliac disease, peanut allergies, halal, vegan, or personal tastes. You don’t like tomatoes? Tell me, I’ll replace it with another tinned fruit/vegetable. Don’t have a cooker? Let me find something you can cook in the microwave. Vegan? I’ll replace the tinned meat with a bag of beans/legumes. 

My job is to feed you as best as i can. If you don’t like what’s in the parcel, I can swap items out so that you’ll eat them. 

You are not a choosing beggar for asking, but please be patient if we can’t fully accommodate your request.

Why YSK: Many working class people are living paycheck to paycheck. If something goes wrong, you may have to visit your local foodbank. It’s important to know that foodbank workers are there for you. Speak up if you’re uncomfortable with your parcel, we just want you to eat.
