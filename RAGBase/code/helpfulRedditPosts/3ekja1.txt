LPT: If your wondering if someone has been staring at you/checking you out, see if you can make them follow your gaze.

content:
Let's say you're out somewhere and you think someone is checking you out or you can "feel" them staring. If you want to test whether or not they are staring, pretend as though something has suddenly captured your attention and stare at it intently for a few seconds. Then, steal a glance at the person you suspect of staring. If the person is now looking at whatever you were looking at, chances are they were sizing you up and and are curious about what they believe piqued your interest. It's best to choose to look at something outside of the person's field of vision so it's obvious they're following your gaze; I'll usually look at my shoes.

BONUS: u/zostendorf made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2cdfu3/lpt_if_you_think_someone_is_staring_at_you_give_a/) post suggesting to see if they'll reciprocate a yawn. In the comments section, u/Swalka added that checking your watch also works. Both seem pretty solid to me.

Edit: gramma're


Update: Many have added that checking the time, sipping a drink, or any other action that might induce subconscious mimicry will work as well. Yawning has been mentioned alot; I included it in the original post as a "bonus" since it has already been posted in another LPT.  I misused the word "your" and I can't change it in the title, and for that I am truly sorry although glad that I've been made aware of this bad habit of mine. Many also suggested to simply approach the person; to clarify, I only meant this to be for the negligible portion of reddit who aren't (I hope that's right) totally epic sexers. I also have it on good authority that I am a faggot, my mother is a lot more promiscuous than I thought, possibly a pedophile and likely guilty of crimes against humanity for birthing me into a doctor's capable hands instead of a boiling vat of diabetic wound pus. I've never had more fun with reddit, thanks!

SuperHappyTime edit: whom to who

Bonus(married edition): u/TCFirebird has pointed out this may be useful to tell if your spouse is actually listening to you.
