YSK: schoolkids can get free lunch during the summer (USA)

content:

If you have a school-aged student in need of breakfast and lunch this summer, simply text “FOOD” to 877877 and receive a message back with the location closest to you where they can get free summer meals. Generally these programs do not require any proof of need, they just feed anyone who shows up. Even if you aren't in need, someone else's kids are. This is a nationwide program so please share this information. If you can't text you can call 1-866-348-6479 the National Hunger Hotline.
