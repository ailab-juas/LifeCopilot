LPT: Learn your highway lane discipline. 

content:
Now I know this sounds like something that should be common sense, but after taking a cross country road trip i have realized a lot of people do not know how to properly drive on the highway. It's quite simple, basically the left lane is for passing, and the right lane is for cruising. I always try and go 9 MPH over the speed limit in order to avoid cops, and tend to stick in the right lane. When passing is necessary however, I will switch to the left lane. Now here's the part that most people don't do, once you are done passing the slower car, GET BACK INTO THE RIGHT LANE. Also if someone is going too slow in the left lane and you are trying to pass, rather than honking your horn at them just give them a simple flash of your brights. It's a real pain in the ass when people don't know these simple rules, so learn them and practice them or else people are gonna think you're a jackass.
