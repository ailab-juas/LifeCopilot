LPT: keep a "date kit" in your car (as well as an emergency kit)

content:
Along with a standard roadside emergency kit and first aid kit, I keep a "date kit" for when I am running a bit late or just find myself with an impromptu date.  It has saved me plenty of times when I get stuck at work late, or just want to do a once over before I knock on the door.  Just some basic stuff I keep in mine, as an example:
*Comb
*Listerine strips
*Small sample tubes of my most frequently worn colognes
*Chapstick
*small mirror
*$30 (in case of calling a cab home, etc)
*Whisp (single use toothbrush thing)
*Nail file
*Tissues
* Allergy meds, tylenol, medications
*Box of condoms (because you really cant cary more than one in a wallet)
*Bottle of wine (in the trunk): you never know when you are going to be invited home with someone...

Ladies, obviously would probably want a makeup compact, etc, but I would assume you have purses for that :-)  I'd love input on what a woman might want in there though.  Having this stuff has saved me many times I was running late, and it is always a good confidence boost to check yourself right before you dive into a date.  Other helpful things from my other car kits that have been helpful are:
*flashlight (lady looses an earring, etc)
*gauze pad (for a lady wearing new, unbroken-in shoes)
*umbrella, in case of inclement weather

EDIT: wow, thanks for all the replies and tips.  I got a lot of good tips (thanks for all the "NO dont keep condoms in your car if its hot!).  It was especially interesting to hear the female equivalent, although again, you guys get a purse to cary with you (so jealous of this boon).  For those that say this type of thing is trying to hard, or creepy, to each their own (or, "haters gonna hate," whichever you prefer).  I wouldnt post this if it hadnt been working out well for me, and again, lots of it (umbrella, gauze for shoe blisters, etc) is actually to make sure she is comfortable.  For all the immature, uncreative rape jokes, I hope your parents are proud somewhere.
