LPT: Just because you did something wrong in the past, doesn’t mean you can’t advocate against it now. It doesn’t make you a hypocrite. You grew. Don’t let people use your past to invalidate your current mindset. Growth is a concept. Embrace it.

I just found this quote online and wanted to share it with you guys. Sorry if it’s not the right sub, please let me know. 

When I read this it really spoke to me. I’ve made mistakes in the past but I’ve also learned from them and I’m a better person because of it. 

Everyone makes mistakes and the only thing to do is deal with them and learn from it. Don’t let anyone hold your past wrongdoings against you in order to belittle or invalidate the person you are now.


Edit: Can I just say this post is not directed at American politics. I’m not from America nor do I know much about your politics. I’ve not heard of the name Biden until today, sorry! 

Also, thank you to everyone for the upvotes and rewards, I really didn’t expect this post to gain much attention! To the people who are saying they needed to hear this today, I’m so glad it has uplifted you even a little!
