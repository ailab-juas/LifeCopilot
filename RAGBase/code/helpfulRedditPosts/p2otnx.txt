title:
LPT: When a waiter doesn’t recommend something, DONT GET IT

content:

I’ve worked at many restaurants and let me tell you, if we tell you that we don’t recommend something then don’t get it at all, it’s our polite way of saying it’s either nasty or gross or made in a bad way. 

Edit: thanks for the likes and grammar and other word stuff
