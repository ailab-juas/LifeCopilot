LPT: Never sure if you locked your door, only to go back and find that you did? Try doing something different and memorable after locking it; like flipping your keys from behind your back, twirling them in your fingers, or tapping them on the wall.

content:
I do this, then when I think back "did I lock the door?" I remember I tossed my keys and tried to catch them with my pocket afterwards(or whatever it was that time).

Edit: To clarify, you do a different thing each time you lock your door, so it's unique and memorable.

Edit 2: The general consensus is:

1) A lot of people do some variation of this, and there is a scientific definition for the behavior.

2) I have, or appear to have OCD

3) I should just "get a smart lock"

4) Well, the capital letters in my username show that I already know, so you don't need to tell me.
