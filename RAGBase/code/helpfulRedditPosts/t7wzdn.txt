LPT: If you're struggling to clean soap scum off a shower before a rental inspection quickly turn on the shower just before they're due to arrive.

content:
Soap scum is one of those things that will make your bathroom look terrible and definitely something a lot of landlords will not like to see.  However, it can at times also be really tough to clean off, or you're just out of what you need to clean it and the inspection is any minute now.  Sometimes life just gets in the way.

Just turn on the shower.  Soap scum will quite often turn invisible when wet.  It may just be enough to cause your landlord to miss it this time and give you time to get it properly clean later.

This obviously only really helps if the rest of the place is clean and tidy.
