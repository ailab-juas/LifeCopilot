title:
LPT: Google your kids prospective name before theyre born

content:
When you are trying to pick a baby name, make sure you google the first and last name. My kid is now older but I realized I messed up about a year ago. Did a quick google search to find out my son is named after a high ranking officer in the confederate army and gave probably the most racist speech in the history of the united states. Does not help that we're white and in the deep south. We certainly didnt know that. We struggled finding a name and when we could finally agree upon one we were only down to the middle name. Middle name doesnt match but still.

Edit: Im really not worried, but I thought it was a good LPT. Its not hitler or robert e lee or someone as famous as that, but there will definitely be folks, especially in the south, that would recall the name. just checked and there are statues, parks, and highways named after him....
