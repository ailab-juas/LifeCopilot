YSK: You shouldn't bathe your cat unless they can't clean themselves or need a medical bath.

Why YSK: If cats are bathed too often, they may lose essential oils from their fur, and it may be a traumatizing experience for them. As a general rule, cats are extremely clean animals and spend most of their time grooming and mending themselves. It is part of their daily ritual. They've been cleaning themselves pretty well long before humans.

 Bathing your cat is totally unnecessary unless it is a new born kitten, a cat that is too sick to take care of itself or a hairless cat. 

If you DO need to bathe your feline friend, make sure you let them get used to the water slowly.



Edit: Realized after reading some comments about specific situations that I should have put "Emergency/Medical bath" in the title.

Edit 2: Hairless cats definitely do need a helping paw occasionally. Vets recommend hypoallergenic cat wipes for these little guys.

Edit 3: Cats get gunk buildup over the course of several years just like dogs and often struggle to completely remove it themselves as it is stuck to their skin. This is why it is important to BRUSH your kitties often and use special cat wipes. Brushing their hair promotes hair growth, loosens the gunk and stimulates the follicles which produce the oils. It is a much better alternative to bathing them and they will love you for it!
