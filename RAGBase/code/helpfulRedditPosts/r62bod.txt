LPT: If you’re going to the gym and notice an out of shape person going consistently, be sure to compliment them when you see them making progress. It’s hard to keep up motivation and this can mean the world to them and boost their confidence.

I know when I first started out, this happened to me. It really confirmed my hard work was paying off. It’s hard to tell personally if you’re actually making decent strides.

Edit: To all of these negative comments. Try being less cynical in life. Accepting compliments is positive for your mental health. Believe it or not, most people are being kind vs patronizing. Life is short so I’m sorry you’re angry at it. I hope you guys eventually start smiling more often.

Also, I’m not saying walk up to a random person and say “wow, you made it! Good job jackass!” I’m saying that if someone is busting their ass day in and day out, a simple kind word can go a long way.

Lastly. Clearly people want encouragement or they wouldn’t have posted thousands if not millions of “progress pics” since the inception of Reddit. 

Peace.
