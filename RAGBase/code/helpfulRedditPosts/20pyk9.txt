title:
LPT: present with PDF instead of PPT

content:
Have a presentation to do on someone else's conputer? Unsure of the software environment? Can you live without animated slides? (The answer is usually yes - ppt animation is vastly overused.)

The PDF format is purpose built to preserve consistency across platforms. Readers can run full screen. Versioning and fonts are far smaller issues with acrobat or reader than PowerPoint.
