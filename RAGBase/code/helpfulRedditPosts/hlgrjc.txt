title:
LPT: if you offer someone a drink and they say they don’t drink, unless you’re very close with this person, just let it go. Asking them why they don’t drink could make them uncomfortable, or give them unwanted attention.

content:
People stop drinking for a lot of reasons, but often when asked why they suddenly find themselves being questioned, doubted, and that others around them accuse them of judging their own drinking. 

If you just say “ok” and move on, you could be preventing a potentially awkward or uncomfortable situation.
