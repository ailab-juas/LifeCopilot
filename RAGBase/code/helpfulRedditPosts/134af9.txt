title:
YSK GMail email addresses ignore dots and everything after a plus symbol. Also, googlemail = gmail.

content:
All the following address are same:

john.doe@gmail.com

jo.hn.do.e@gmail.com

john.doe@googlemail.com

jo.hn.do.e@googlemail.com

john.doe+spammysite@gmail.com

jo.hn.doe+spammysite@googlemail.com


This is great because you can use this to help identify spam. For eg; 
Use john.doe+xvideos@gmail.com to register on xvideos. Now if you receive spam addressed to this address, you instantly know it was xvideos.


So you have infinite email addresses from just one gmail address. You can use this to create multiple accounts on same site using different aliases.
