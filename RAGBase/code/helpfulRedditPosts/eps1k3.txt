LPT: In America and can't afford medication? Most manufacturers have a patient assistance program that will pay for your meds. You can search for the drug on needymeds.com to see if you qualify

content:
The reason for these patient assistance programs is so that the manufacturer can gouge the insurance companies, but still help those who are in need of the medication but are uninsured, at poverty levels, or have high deductible/co insurance. I've worked for these programs for a few manufacturers, and was able to help tens of thousands of Americans get their medication. 

I hope that someone in need sees this post!
