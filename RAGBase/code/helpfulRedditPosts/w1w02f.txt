LPT: To avoid being an emotional vampire, define yourself by the things you love rather than the things you hate.

content:
If you're someone who regularly expresses themselves by talking about things you don't like, just know that many people will view you as a negative person with negative energy, and therefore won't want to be around you.


You can change this by talking about things you love, and asking what others love. People will be inspired by/admire you and your positive energy, and therefore will love having you around. It's a simple mentality change that will greatly improve how you view yourself and the world around you!
