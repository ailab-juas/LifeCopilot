LPT: Pepper Spray is not immediately effective. You must know that an attacker has time to grapple you, and then you are also smeared with pepper spray.

content:
People may carry pepper spray defensively, and never have a chance to use it. I've used it. It's not a bullet, it does not immediately incapacitate someone. It takes some time for it to overwhelm a person with pain until they "give up". In this time, they can grab you and while struggling you will have pepper spray contact. This will leave you in a worse condition to flee.
  
Pepper Spray comes out in a stream, not a spray or fog. You may want to experiment with shooting it, in a safe outdoor, ventilated environment away from animals, etc. In order to get an understanding of how far it travels. Then consider that pepper spray used and carry a topped-off new one.  

Finally, pepper spray in enclosed areas will affect everyone. While it is a stream of liquid, it does fume.  

Bottom line, if you have to use pepper spray, aim for the assailants face and eyes, and then run.  Also, never hurts to watch a youtube to get experience! Good Luck!
