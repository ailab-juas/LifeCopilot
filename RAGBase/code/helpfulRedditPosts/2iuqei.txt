LPT: If you pay off a bill that's in collection ask the agency for a "pay for delete written agreement"

content:
Depending on the agency, for a small fee, you can pay to have the bill be taken off your credit report completely. This is best if you had numerous late payments on the bill. 

You have to bring it up, otherwise they won't mention it.
