LPT: If you have a senior to check on ask them to "borrow" something small so they think they're helping you.

content:
My mom (72) recently downsized and moved close enough to me that checking on her in person regularly is not really out of my way, but when I was obvious about it she wouldn't let me "stop-by" because she was, "fine". 

Well, one day I actually needed some aluminum foil so I called and asked if I could borrow enough to cover a baking tin because I didn't want to run to the store. She said sure, but when I got to her house she needed furniture moved, a wasp nest removed, and her coffee pot fixed. After I got the foil I mentioned each thing cautiously and she let me take care of them for her. So next weekend I'll need a cup of rice and check on her again.
