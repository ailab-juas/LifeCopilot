title:
YSK SOS in morse code

content:
Why YSK: Sometimes when people are in danger they can't say it outloud, so they try to get your attention with morse code instead. And if you find yourself in danger it's also really good to know morse code. 

Rehearse it every month to make sure that you haven't forgotten it, you never know when you will need it.

Edit: The comments made me realize that I didn't include the morse code in the post, it's °°° - - - °°° (dot dot dot  dash dash dash  dot dot dot)

Edit 2: A good trick if you don't remember the order of the dots and dashes is to look at this: °°° - - - °°° like a face, eye mouth eye

Edit 3: u/PamsDesk said that you can picture it as 000 --- 000 instead if it's easier
