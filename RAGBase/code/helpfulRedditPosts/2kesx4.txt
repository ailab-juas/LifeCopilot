LPT: Never lend money to friends/family. Gift it willingly because you care or don't give at all, or it will damage your relationship.

Edit: To clarify, to me it's not about not being paid back.  A lot of people are saying that if someone doesn't pay you back, they shouldn't be your friend, but that's only part of it.

I feel that even if it gets paid back, in the interim before it does there is tension that can cause issues between you, because if you are expecting them to pay you back then it can cause you to feel slighted when they haven't yet.  And even if you don't worry about it, the person you loaned it to will feel awkward because they will feel beholden to you.  The lender and borrower labels change the power dynamic in the relationship that can lead to hurt feelings.

And what if they don't?  Maybe they can't afford to pay it back, or maybe it has been so long that they feel weird mentioning it.  Maybe they forgot or just have too much social anxiety to give it to you out of fear.  None of those mean they're a terrible person that doesn't deserve to be your friend.  If it's someone you care about it's best not to risk hurt feelings.
