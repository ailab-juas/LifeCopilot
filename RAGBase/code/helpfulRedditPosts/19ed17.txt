5 methods I use to KILL my ego

content:
1, I use the "I" pronoun whenever possible instead of the "you" pronoun when giving advice or stating an opinion. AMAZING results. Instead of saying, "You need to see this new movie", I might say, "I really enjoyed this new movie". I do not have to even tell them, "I suggest you see it" because they can make up their own mind. "You shouldn't eat so much fast food"as opposed to, "I do not eat a lot of fast food because I know it's bad for me" 

2, When someone gives me good advice, I do not let the person get in the way of their information. If someone tells me, "You are LAZY" I try to say, "I will have to work harder" rather than say, "You live in your grandmother's basement and don't even own a car, and you're calling me lazy?" 

3, When someone admits their faults, I acknowledge them instead of telling them how faulty they are. Odds are, the person who is being vulnerable about their weaknesses already knows their extent. I don't need to remind them. 

4, I ask others when I am confused. When someone says a word I don't understand, I ask them what the word means. 

5, Silence is my motto. The less time I spend showing others what I know, the more I learn. The best way I have found to show off my skills is to do it in the form of questions. If someone spells disc golf "disk golf", I ask, "Are you sure it's spelled with a "k"? This may sound like I am beating around the bush, but I am using this as a way to kill my ego. When they arrive at the right answer, they are the source of the right answer, not me.
