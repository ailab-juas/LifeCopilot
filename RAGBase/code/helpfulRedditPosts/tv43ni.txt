LPT It's okay to always be the one to initiate contact with a friend. Just because they don't reach out to you first doesn't mean they don't like you or want to hang out with you.

It's okay to always be that friend who starts up the conversation. Never assume they don't like you or don't want to spend time with you just because they don't text you first or invite you to things. Don't ever tell yourself that without evidence to back it up.

It's a two-way street and they want to feel accepted and feel like they belong just like you do, at least to some degree. You reaching out tells the other person that they are important to you. This boosts your self-esteem for stepping out of your comfort zone and helps them feel more confident in themselves. Double win and you get to spend time with a friend.

Edit: There's this friend of mine who we literary became like brothers and sisters. The first time I visited her I was so surprised everyone in her family knew me. I moved to a new city 4 years ago but always kept in touch with her. I was visiting my parents and called her for us to catch up before she gets married. She said she's too busy in that weekend and she can't. Okay. Fast forward a week later, my other home friends sent me pictures of her wedding. It turns out she got married that weekend I was visiting my parents. I have tried to call her since then but she's has not picked up, apparently she's angry I did not come the wedding.

Edit 2: I knew she's getting married this year but not sure about the date. I'm not blaming her but had she told me she's getting married that Saturday. I would have been there. Now there's some strange theories as to why I was not in attendance. I even come to this sub to look for tips of wedding presents.
