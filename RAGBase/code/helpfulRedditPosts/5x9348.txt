LPT: If you are trying to comfort someone going through a difficult time and can't think of something meaningful to say, be honest and just say "I wish I knew what to say to help you through this". It shows you care and want to help without needing to say something profound.

I've dealt with two deaths this year that have put me in the position of consoling loved ones. While recounting shared memories, offering condolences and assistance, and sometimes just letting them cry, are all comforting, there are some moments that feel like they are waiting for me to say something that will make everything better. But sometimes in life, as much as we wish we could say just the right thing to help a loved one stop feeling hurt, there are no magic words. Expressing that shared sentiment can be comforting in its own way.
