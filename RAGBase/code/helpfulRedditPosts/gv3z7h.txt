title:
YSK that if you have a swarm of bees in your back garden, call one of your local Bee Keepers and they will happily come and remove them for free!

content:
Don’t worry, they won’t kill the bees (unless a disease is found within the colony), they will most likely sell them to people that are looking to expand the amount of hives they have or new bee keepers that want a small starting colony.

Edit 1: To clarify, I’m talking about honey bees. Send a picture to them and they will be able to tell you if their wasps, hornets, honey bees ETC and can advise you what to do from there

Edit 2: If its in a hard to reach area such as the top of a tree or inside a wall, they may charge some money
