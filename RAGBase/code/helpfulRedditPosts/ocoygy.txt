LPT: Be SUPER CAREFUL about how you speak to yourself. Here’s why.

content:
Your brain is always looking for evidence to confirm what you have told it. So if the story in your mind is “things always suck &amp; never work out for me”, your brain is going to seek &amp; find everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It’ll disregard everything that doesn’t. 

This is why when people start to say things like, “show me how it gets better, I know it can get better than this,” it starts to! Because your brain is now looking for evidence for THAT to be true. To show you that life has the capacity to be better. 

So, be intentional about your thoughts and the reality you’re creating.
