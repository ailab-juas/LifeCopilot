LPT: turn off "auto display images" in your email to stop hidden read receipt trackers

content:
Tracking pixels are now commonplace, and these let a sender know that you’ve opened an email they’ve sent, plus the time and date that you did so. They can even see if you’ve forwarded the message to anyone else.

These are tiny bits of code that are usually hidden in images that are included in emails. When you open the email, they are triggered and send back the meta-data (it’s open, here’s when) to the sender. 

Be aware though that this will only stop some from reporting on you. To safeguard your privacy fully, you’ll need to look at browser plug-ins.
