LPT: if you F up and hurt a loved one greatly... apologize, take your lumps, keep your mouth shut unless asked a question, learn from it and move on. If you deviate from this you will prolong the healing process.

of course this doesn't apply to every scenario.  The big picture is -- don't try to justify or defend your F up.


Hurt people sometimes don't think straight. They may say things that are hurtful or hysterical. Let them... assuming you want to salvage your relationship.
