LPT: keep your bedroom windows closed for about a day after the rain has stopped to prevent terrifying spiders from taking up residency.

Edit: to answer many of you, yes I actually do have one screen on a small window that I leave open. I close all the others though. 

The thing is, I live in South Africa and I've only ever seen like one other person with a screen so I thought my advice was helpful.

Also, the worst, common spiders we get here are [rain spiders] (https://www.google.co.za/search?q=rain+spiders&amp;client=ms-android-xiaomi&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt4KX_z9vXAhXiDsAKHc8GCSoQ_AUIEigB&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=564), which are not dangerous but fucking scary. Also moths and [christmas beetles] (https://www.google.co.za/search?q=Christmas+beetles&amp;client=ms-android-xiaomi&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU4cT10dvXAhVsB8AKHWRoD7YQ_AUIEigB&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=564) can stay out too please.
