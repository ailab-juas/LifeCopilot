LPT: Repeat a desired habit immediately &gt;10x to 'lock it in.'

content:
In Air Force basic training the training instructors would turn on the lights and we'd jump out of bed and make the bed in seconds. Then they'd tell us to get back into bed, turn off the lights, and do it again (good times).

After ten or twenty repetitions in a row, your body gets the idea.

I used this recently to teach myself to hang up my coat when I get in. Enter home, walk to closet, hang coat on hanger. Grab coat, walk back out of home. Repeat ten or so times and it replaces 'chuck your coat wherever' reflex.

Edit: wrong version of hanger. Not where we kept our airplanes.
