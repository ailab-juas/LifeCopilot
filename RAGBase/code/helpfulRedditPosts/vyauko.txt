LPT: Use an affirmation as a password you write daily.

content:
Affirmations work if done consistently, but remembering to do them every day is hard. 

Set the password on something you open every day (like your computer) to an affirmation. Then you will think that affirmation every day as you log in. 

I've used this for years now, changing to a new affirmation every few months when I feel like the old one has worked, or I have something new I want to focus on. 

Typing out (and thinking) things similar to IDeserveToBeLoved or I_am_good_enough very day changed the way I view myself - and the choices I make in my life - for the better.

Edit: Wow! Didn't expect this to get so much attention. Thanks for all the comments, upvotes and awards!

For those making the very valid point about password security, I want to to add two things:
1. This isn't a password to reuse online (because hackers). If you can, use it on one piece of hardware that you keep physically secure, like a laptop that lives at home.
2. Throw some numbers and special characters into the password as well. 

I do this too, but didn't mention it as I was trying to keep the post brief and focus on the basic idea. But you guys are right, security is important!
