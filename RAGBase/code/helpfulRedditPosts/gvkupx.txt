title:
LPT: Always use your PTO before leaving a job or announcing you’re leaving. No matter how long of a notice you give

content:
IN THE USA : 
Sometimes even when you give a 2 weeks notice, companies are not always required to pay you your accumulated PTO!! Some fine line in the employee handbook may say that the company is required to pay only 50%, which is a lot of money if you have many hours cumulated. 
Also always try to use your PTO during the year, because if you get laid off or fired you could lose it all at once.
Edit: grammatical error
Edit: added in the US specifically because all the Euro people complaining that this doesn’t apply to them. Good for you lads. Good for you.
