LPT: If you see a potential suspect, remember the shoes. They may turn the jacket inside out, throw away the cap and put on glasses, but they almost never have time to or think of changing the shoes.

A friend's dad is a cop, and this was his comment on the one thing that he wished witnesses would do more. Clothes can be tossed, or they may have a spare set hidden in some bushes.

I just mention for clarity: if you witness a crime, call the police. Don't put yourself in danger. Don't follow running suspects. Unless you are a trained professional, you help more with information to the investigator than with heroic acts.
