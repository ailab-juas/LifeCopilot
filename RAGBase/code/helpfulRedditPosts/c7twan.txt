YSK: Firearm blanks are dangerous. Often portrayed as safe, blanks fired at very close range can burn, blind, deafen, or kill the person they're pointed at.

Treat all guns as if they are loaded all the time.
Always be aware of your backstop.
Don't point a gun at anyone you're not prepared to kill.
