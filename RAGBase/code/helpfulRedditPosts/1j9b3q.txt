LPT: If you want to cut watermelon in half and don't have a knife, use a (cleaned) quarter to make a incision 1/2 a quarter thick around the entire watermelon and karate chop it; it cuts it in half with no splatter or mess. Seriously.

Just found this out myself it and it works like a charm. Watermelon never tasted so good.

**Edit 1**: 1/2 a quarter **deep**. My bad.

**Edit 2**: A "quarter" as in the [**coin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_\(United_States_coin\)), which is about [an inch \(.955in or 24.26mm\) across](http://i.imgur.com/GumH1PP.jpg?1). However, any large coin should do just fine.

**Edit 3**: Don't karate chop the everliving shit out of the watermelon; you really don't need to do it very hard at all. Unless you want to make a mess. Then by all means beat that fucker to a pulp.
