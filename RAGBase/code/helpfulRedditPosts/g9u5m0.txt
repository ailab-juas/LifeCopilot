YSK you can help combat child sexual abuse and sex trafficking by uploading photos of your hotel rooms to TraffickCam

content:
If you travel and stay in hotel rooms please consider using [TraffickCam](https://traffickcam.com)

Take a couple of quick pictures of the room any time you stay in a hotel/motel and upload them to the website. These images are added to a database which can be compared to the background of sexual abuse images and videos. Sex traffickers also regularly post photographs of their victims posed in hotel rooms for online advertisements.

This can help law enforcement identify the location where offences took place, as well as the identity of the victims and perpetrators.

Thereâ€™s also an app under the same name which you can keep on your phone. It only takes a few minutes and you could really be helping a vulnerable victim.
