YSK if you are experiencing a lot of static shocks, or unusually staticky laundry, humidifying your house may fix it. This is especially true if you have a wood stove, if you can you should always keep a teapot full of water on it.

Why YSK: Dry air causes static. Static discharge can damage electronics if they arenâ€™t properly grounded. But mostly static shocks are annoying. 


The static is just one of the annoyances of overly dry air. For me I also experience dry skin and occasionally sinus discomfort if the air is especially dry. But the static is one of the signs I notice first.
