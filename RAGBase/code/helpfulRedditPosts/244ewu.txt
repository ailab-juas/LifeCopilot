LPT: How to increase your chances of winning a raffle.

content:
When entering a raffle and writing down your personal information on the piece of paper, crumple it in your hands a little bit and unfold after.  When it comes time to pick a winner, the person grabbing the paper will more likely than not pick the entry that has creases around it than all the other flat pieces of paper. Ever since a friend told me his secret, I've won 3 raffles in a span of 2 months. ($1000 Amazon GC, $500 Best Buy GC and a $25 iTunes GC.)
