"Using prophylactic (preventive) antipyretics (fever reducers) immediately after vaccination and during the next 24 hours reduces the rate of fever following vaccination. However, giving these medicines, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to prevent fever after vaccination may also blunt immune responses to the vaccine." - https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/studies.html
