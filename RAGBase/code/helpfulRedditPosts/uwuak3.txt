title:
YSK that the stitches holding together the pleats and flaps on skirts, jackets, and coats are meant to be cut before the items are worn.

content:
Why YSK:  They’re called “tacking stitches” and they’re usually white or gray, forming an X on the outside of the flap/pleat. These stitches are only needed to keep the flaps and pleats smooth before being sold. Cutting them allows the clothing to fit as it was designed, with the flaps and pleats helping the fabric to move with you.
