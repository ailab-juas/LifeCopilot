LPT: If someone is upset but keeps turning down all of your suggestions of how to improve the situation, they might just need to vent.

content:
 Sometimes people just need to sit down and be sad, and just being allowed to tell someone how and why they're feeling hopeless will help far more than both of you getting angry and upset with each other over suggested actions they can't or won't be taking. Someone who keeps turning down all of your advice might not be seeking for advice, just having a listening ear can help far better. Let people be sad sometimes.
