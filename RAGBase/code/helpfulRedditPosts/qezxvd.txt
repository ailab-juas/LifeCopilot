LPT: Everytime you feel like you're too old to start something; remember that time will still pass regardless of you doing or not doing the thing you love.

This happened to me today when I was thinking whether or not I should go back to nursing school after years in college in studying a completely different field.
I started thinking about how old am I going to be. And everyone will think that am kinda weird or something's is wrong with me (and it gets kinda awful with depression)

But then I thought that after 4 years (the time it will take to complete the degree) I will be 28, and I will probably kick my self in the NUTS for not doing something I liked.
So here you go.

Tl;Dr: don't think about how old you are right now; think about how old you will be either you did what you like or not!

Edit: wow wow, a big thank you to everyone who has given me an award or shared an inspiration with me, I just woke up and I will read every comment!
Thanks ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
