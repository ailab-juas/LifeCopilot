YSK: FURminators don't remove dead coat in your pets. They cut all coat without regard for dead versus live hairs.

Why YSK: If you have one at home. Look between the teeth to see a blade. This is why they get such "amazing" results compared to traditional grooming tools. because its not only removing dead coat. Its a blade, that cuts the fur. Their shampoos and other products are also trash talked in the grooming industry. Talk with your local groomer about the best brush for your dog's coat type. I've included some examples below.


For curly hair(doodles, bichons, etc.): a slicker brush in combination with a metal, wide toothed comb is your friend. A slicker brush is a wire bristled brush with a bend in each wire. The slicker brush will remove the tangles, and the comb is used to check your work, as it will get snagged on small tangles.


For long haired breeds: The same as the curly haired ones. A slicker in combination with a metal, wide toothed comb. These guys are also prone to eye goop that dries into the fur beneath their eyes. Soften with water and pick out with a flea comb.


For long haired double coated breeds(samoyeds, malamutes, etc): a slicker brush and metal comb for longer areas and tangles. The slicker can also help get dead coat out. Other tools as effective for dead coat but useless on tangles are groomers stones, and rubber curry brushes. For dogs with sensitive skin, the curry brush is very gentle and wont cause brush burn. But the most effective tool for removing dead coat on these breeds isn't a brush at all its a high velocity blow dryer. It is way faster, but more messy.


For short haired breeds(pitties, labs, etc.) an equigroomer will help get dead fur out. Its my tool of choice for these pups.
