YSK that eyeglasses are heavily marked up in stores and can be bought at significant discounts

content:
The majority of glasses nowadays, including your designer frames and industry-standard lenses, are cheaply manufactured in China. They're marked up quite a bit domestically for significant profit, since people are now used to the prices and insurance companies are used to covering it. If you know your current prescription and pupillary distance (you can get both from your optometrist if needed), you can have your prescription filled online at a Chinese eyeglasses website. Prices are generally somewhere in the $40-50 range before shipping, they are up to the same quality as any domestic pair and they have an incentive to provide the best possible product: even at these prices, they still make more profit than they do with selling glasses in China. As someone who used to spend $300/pair for essentially the same thing, the savings are significant.

http://www.zennioptical.com and http://www.goggles4u.com are pretty well-regarded and trusted for international glasses. There are a ton of websites that cater to NA and EU buyers, but it's best to stick to sites that have received Western coverage like these. I'd love to hear about other sites and people's experiences with them. Even if you feel better using domestic sources for your primary glasses/glasses with specialized coatings, this is something to consider if you want a pair of prescription sunglasses or a cheap second pair for work.

EDIT: [An optical assistant in this thread wrote a list of things you should know when getting glasses online.](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2j81m1/ysk_that_eyeglasses_are_heavily_marked_up_in/cl9tjqv) Please read it over before making an order, it's incredibly helpful and easy to understand. I wish I had it around when I made my first order.
