LPT: Don’t be shy about celebrating your own birthday. Being quiet about it and hoping people give you the attention you desire often results in disappointment.

I have often made the mistake of expecting people to remember my birthday on their own and going out of their way to celebrate me. I would often think, “Surely they will remember and support me if they love me”! This RARELY happens for anyone. 

This year, I decided to go out of my way to let people know it was my birthday. I expressed excitement, changed my attitude, and decided to make it a good day myself. This small change drastically changed my birthday experience. For the first time in years, when people asked me how my birthday was, I was able to honestly reply, “It was fantastic!”. 

People genuinely want to tell you happy birthday, and as long as they know, they will want to celebrate with you. Don’t let your pride get in the way of having a great day. Don’t expect people to remember your birthday on top of everyone else’s birthday that they know.

(EDIT: I know there are many that don’t want the attention on their birthday. They are completely content either celebrating on their own or not at all, and that is ok. This post is for those who desire the celebration but have too high of expectations of others remembering and celebrating them a certain way.)

(ANOTHER EDIT: I am not condoning people that are obnoxious. I am not encouraging forcing your birthday upon others. I am simply saying that you should celebrate however you want, even if that means you don’t celebrate. Your happiness should not be dependent on others remembering your birthday. If you want to share that day with people you care about, let them know and they are usually more than happy to celebrate with you)
