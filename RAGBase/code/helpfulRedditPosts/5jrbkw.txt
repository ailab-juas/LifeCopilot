LPT: Increase your offers to help a friend who is mourning about 6 weeks after the death of their loved one. This is the point at which the initial wave of support has died off and people are particularly vulnerable.

content:
A wise leader of a church taught me this.  He had helped many through the grieving process. When a close friend of mine lost a loved one tragically, I asked him what I should do to help them.  He taught me that often, the hardest time for people while grieving was when the initial wave of condolences had gone away and people don't really know/forget to offer help anymore.  Meanwhile, the person grieving has to start trying to transition back to "normal life" and routines and they are often left more lonely than ever. **(Note , I have noticed that this jump in time to support can be much sooner that six weeks, sometimes it is a soon as a few day).


To be clear, offering to help initially is great and important as well but consistent continued support is priceless. 

Edit:  I wish I could **hug** all of you through the screen.  So many of you have shared your advice about your personal struggles with loved ones.... Thank-you.
