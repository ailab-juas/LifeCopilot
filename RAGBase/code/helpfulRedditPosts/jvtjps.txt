LPT: Never hold 100% to any belief that you are absolutely sure of . always leave atleast a 1% chance to question your belief in light of new information

content:
Chances are that if you starts to question something , there would be so much evidence for the belief that you are holding that you would rightly reject the supposed new information which may or may not be true and just a plain rumor

Eg Flat Earth ... There is so many evidence in favour of the earth not flat that no new rumor or any new conspiracy theory will hold

EDIT This Blew Up . I agree this is something not a LPT and should be obvious from get go ... but for the last month faced us with scenario where some of my friend lack of open mindedness left us with terrible loss. Many people I know just dont want to listen and act a dangerous precedent ... As long as you are willing to rationalize and use mind you would be comapartively less to get caught in cult mentality .....

I think Just having an Acceptance that this might be something true even I am sure of the other and do your own research  and with enough evidence claim or reject something is what is required

EDIT 2 The obvious LPT definately is more in the context of everyday life and situations. Obviously there are accepted facts that Holocaust Happened , moon revolves around the sun , earth is not flat etc which have Something  we Have large amount of evidence that supports it

EDIT 3 I think If there is something that you heard on fb and a new conspiracy theory , its definately have a higher chance that you would reject that because there is nothing that would support that unfounded claim
