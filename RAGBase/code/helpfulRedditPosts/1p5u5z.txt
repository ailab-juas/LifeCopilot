LPT: Freeze soup in zip-lock bags, flatten them out before freezing for easy storage and fast thawing.

content:
Stack them in the freezer so they freeze flat, into sheets. Once frozen, they're easy to store in the small spaces in the freezer. They also thaw quite fast. I thawed out a soup bag this morning in just a few hours. 

**Edit:** More suggestions:

* freeze it on a tray in case of leakage. 
* Freeze it in single serving sizes (or double servings if you live with a partner or think soup is a whole meal), so you know how much you need to thaw out each time. 
* Just take a bag out of the freezer in the morning, ~~thaw it in the sink (it'll probably be kinda wet) and it'll be ready for dinner.~~ Turns out some of you feel really strongly about not doing this. Thaw it in the fridge instead. 
* This idea also works for sauces, stocks, mince meat, stews, anything liquid-y. 
* Just wash out the bag when you're done and reuse it! 

Easy as ~~pie~~ soup!
