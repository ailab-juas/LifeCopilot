LPT: Step back and zoom in if your camera has mechanical optics, your portraits will look more professional.

By zooming in with mechanical optics, proportions won't end up distorted and exaggerated.

Here's an example of a handgun between a kit lense 18mm-55mm: http://imgur.com/VNUlygD

In order to keep the pistol framed in the photo when using the 55mm end of the lense, I had to step about twice as far away.

Your point and shoot can do similar changes; A Canon Powershot has a range of 6.2-24.8mm for it's built in lense, but with a 1/2.3-inch sensor, the lense has the effect of a ~35-140mm
