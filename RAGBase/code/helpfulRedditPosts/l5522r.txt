YSK that if your child has a favorite toy/stuffie that they can't live without, your should buy multiples of it before it's too late.

It's seen all the time on r/helpmefind... People looking for a stuffed animal that their child can't sleep without. When my best friend gave birth to her child, I bought him a stuffed giraffe. He was in love with it, and couldn't go to bed without it. About 6 months after his birth, she reached out to me, and asked me where I got it. She realized that she needed a backup. Luckily I got it on the the biggest website in the world, so it was still available. She immediately bought two of them. You should do the same if you have a child that is in love with a certain toy or stuffed animal.

Why YSK: If you don't keep backups of favorite sentimental toys, when the toy wears out or is lost, heart break and sleepless nights can ensue.
