LPT: When you have a 3 day weekend, do all of your chores (laundry, cleaning, homework, projects, etc) the night BEFORE your 3 day weekend begins. You may have to stay up late that night but you'll thank yourself later when you have 3 full days to relax.

Edit: Wholy crap I didn't realize it'd be this big of a response...I get it for all of you that have kids (I do as well he's just a lil one so I'm not there just yet hahah) But someone else in the comments I think said what I was trying to say in my LPT but much better:

Do all your chores (yes I know thet never end but the ones that seem most pressing) before your weekend, if possible.
