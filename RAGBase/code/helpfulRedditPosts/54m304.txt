LPT: Whenever someone recommends you a place to check out, star it on Google Maps. Next time you're in that city/state, you'll have a bunch of stars to visit.

I like to star everything and everything people recommend to me. Say someone mentions this great seafood restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina. Now, while I am not planning on going to Charleston ever, I star it on Google Maps. If I ever visit Charleston in my life, I have at least one place now that I should check out.

Edit: I'm admittedly a Googly fanboy but are there any other apps where saving locations is this simple? Very curious, thanks!

Edit2: first front page post! Please excuse me while I hijack this post to say hi, future employer! No, I was not lying about making it to the front page of Reddit once.
