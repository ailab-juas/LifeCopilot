LPT: Get people to like you by speaking their love language.

content:
Communicate love/respect/friendship to a person in the 'language' they understand - there are 5. For context, here is an example of when you invite someone over to your place.

* Physical touch - Greet them with a handshake, hug, kiss.. whatever is appropriate to your culture and relationship.
* Acts of Service - "Can I carry that for you? Can I take your coat?" Offer to help in some way.
* Receiving Gifts - Offer them a beverage, food, token, or other thoughtful item.
* Quality Time - Give them attention, listen; put away the distractions and focus on their story.
* Words of Affirmation - Pay him or her a genuine compliment.

Not every action is going to resonate with every person, so I prefer to hit them all with a shotgun approach.  My parents called this *being a good host*, but now I understand why.  The way it makes people feel when you connect with their love language (credit to [Gary Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages)) is truly inspiring.  Try it out!
