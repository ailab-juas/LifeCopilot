LPT: If you see an item on sale, (such a €100 item is now €60) remember, you're not saving €40, you're just spending €60.

Countless people buy things they don't need, "because it was on sale." I felt the need to post this after my mam bought a rather unneeded pizza cuter for €1.50, that's normally €5. "Sure, for that price, how could you lose?" We have a pizza cuter already and it works fine. She didn't save money, just wasted more.
