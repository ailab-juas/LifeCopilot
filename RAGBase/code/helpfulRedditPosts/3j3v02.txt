LPT: Windows users, alt-space is your friend when a window opens up outside the visible area of your screen

content:
Sometimes (especially when changing from multiple to single display configurations), a window or popup will open up outside your display area, making it impossible to proceed. 

Hit alt-space to bring up the window menu.  Click on "move".  Then use your arrow keys to reposition the window within your visible display area.
