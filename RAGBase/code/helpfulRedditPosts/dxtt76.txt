YSK that you should always ask the dog owner before petting their dog, if you're initiating the interaction.

content:
Not all dogs are always open to interacting with strangers. It can especially be dangerous if it's a small child, and I think it should be educated better to make sure to ask the owner before running up to a fluffy friend.

This is a polite gesture for both the dog and the owner. In the human side of the case, this is true if it has ever happened that their dog or their space has been violated by a random stranger. Some people are simply trying to have a quiet walk, and a sudden hand coming out of nowhere can sometimes be really startling. Plus, it's the owner's dog, their family in the first place. Imagine a stranger suddenly grabbing your child!

However, most of the time, it is more important to know when to respect a dog's space. Especially for rescue dogs. Some may have severe trauma from being abused by people, hence extremely terrorised by human hands reaching towards them. This can result in biting, being very dangerous for small children.

So please, make sure you ask whenever you would like to pet someone's dog. When they say no, they don't like being pet, respect their warning.

I've seen unfortunate cases where people brush the warning off saying "oh I'm a true dog whisperer", and proceeding to touch the dog, causing extreme reactions from the dog, and distress to surrounding people. Let's not let that happen, and protect both ourselves and the dogs.
