YSK, if you and your partner are not using condoms, you may find coconut oil to be a highly superior lubricant

content:
My wife and I tried coconut oil after finding strong suggestions in its favor among some comments on Reddit. She's now convinced it's the best thing we found on Reddit, ever. :)

Pros:

* Lubricates the vagina better, while providing *way* more friction than our previous lubes. This sounds like a contradiction, but my wife explains the water-based lube was dehydrating her, reducing sensation, and yet she could still tear from hard penetration. With coconut oil, the tearing does not happen, while at the same time we feel the friction much more.

* Lasts longer than our previous lubes. Requires fewer reapplications.

* Smells good. One of my wife's first remarks was how she loves the smell. It puts her in the mood.

* Edible with neutral taste. No worries about going down on someone who's been lubed.

* Doubles as massage oil. Hands full of coconut oil? Just rub it into her tits or ass. It does not feel icky, and gets absorbed.

* A ubiquitous commodity. No need to visit a sex shop. You can find it cheap in a grocery store.

Cons:

* It is a solid at room temperature, but a liquid at body temperature. It melts very quickly, but still takes a few precious moments to melt. My wife turns those moments into a pleasurable build-up of sexual tension. :)

* It is oil-based, so it degrades condoms. Do not use with condoms. (And of course, don't have sex without any birth control just to try coconut oil!)
