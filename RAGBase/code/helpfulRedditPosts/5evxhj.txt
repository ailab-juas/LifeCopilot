LPT: Do you get a lot of dog or wife hair in your vacuum? Clear it out of the roller with a sowing "seam ripper" in a about 2 mins.

content:
For Too long I was using scissors and pliers, this seam ripper changed my vacuuming life.

EDIT: Yes it's "sew" not "sow" =(
I'm sorry I messed up english is my first language.

EDIT2: woke up to a ton of comments, sorry I can't reply to all of them 

EDIT3: I seriously don't care if your boyfriend/husbands hair is longer than yours. Stop telling me
