LPT: Put a peeled banana in the freezer for a snack that almost has the same texture and taste of ice cream but without the guilt or calories.

I should *have* said 'but with less guilt or calories' as opposed to "without the guilt or calories". But never mind. Still though it was a great snack to have during an unbearably hot August this year.

Happy to see quite a few other people agree or will try it out
