LPT: If you're a manager, be a mentsch. Don't contact people when they're not working unless absolutely necessary

content:
I recognize that there are times where there's some information needed NOW but most of the time a request for info isn't needed immediately, I just want to ask now so I don't forget later. But that's not a good reason to disturb someone who's off work. Instead, I compose an email and send it with delayed delivery such that it's scheduled to arrive when the person is back at work.  

Voila, you haven't forgotten to get the info you needed AND you've respected work/home boundaries
