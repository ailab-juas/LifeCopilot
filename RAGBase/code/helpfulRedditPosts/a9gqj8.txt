LPT: I know some of you are alone during the holidays. Just know one thing, each of you are amazing and unique and I am happy to be a part of Reddit with each of you. Thank you for making me laugh and smile when days are down. If you are alone and need someone to chat to, message me. Happy Holidays!

Update:

Someone just gave me gold and I am speechless. It’s my first gold ever. Thank you Redditor, it has made my day, from the bottom of my heart. 

I’ve enjoyed so many conversations with so many of you. I appreciate the connection we have made and interesting tidbits I’ve learned from you. 

Thank you Reddit for a fun Christmas Day! 

I’m checking this all night by the way so keep the chats/messages coming. :)

Update 2: 

I can’t believe the overwhelming number of messages. I should have now replied back to everyone and if I missed you, I’m sorry and will get back to you shortly. I am also blown away by the silver, gold and platinum. Thank you all so much. It means so much to me. 

Update 3:

I think I am caught up on all the messages....phew. That was a lot and my fingers are numb from typing on my phone. I’m happy we all came together as a community to support each other. Thank you for everyone who chatted with me, private messaged me, some folks texted me too. Very appreciative of all the kind words.
