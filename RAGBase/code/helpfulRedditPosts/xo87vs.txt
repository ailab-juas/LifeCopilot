title:
YSK that photos on your smartphone are almost certainly recording date, time and GPS location in something called EXIF data.

content:
Why YSK: this can be helpful if you need to know when or where a picture was taken, and you can even group photos by location. It also removes
the need to prove when or where a photo was taken, as someone might try to do with a newspaper or landmark included. It's already there! 
However, it can also be dangerous if you are not wanting to share that information, such as inadvertently revealing the location of your home
by simply posting a photo. An
absolute must YSK for anyone fleeing a situation of violence. Always assume that sharing a photo is also sharing your time and location! The data
can be removed before sharing but very few people know how to or even think to do this.
