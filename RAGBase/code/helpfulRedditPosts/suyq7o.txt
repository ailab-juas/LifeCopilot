You don't have to be a robot, but it's useful to think twice before getting overly personal at work. Additionally, as much as your business may tout sharing with your manager, remember that your one-on-ones are definitely not therapy sessions, and you have no obligation to share details beyond the scope of your work, from what you're doing on the weekend to how you're feeling.
