LPT: When you first get home from your day, if a chore takes less than 10 minutes, do it right away. Trash is full? Take it out before you take off your shoes. Just a few dishes in the sink? Wash'em right then. Clothes hamper full? Throw a load in the washer.

This will help you to be able to fully relax when you get settled in for the evening and prevent these little things from pilling up to bigger jobs later.
