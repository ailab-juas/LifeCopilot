LPT: If you have something coming up that you're nervous about, like an interview, presentation or a phone call, make yourself busy in the time leading up to it, so that you won't spend hours stressing over it.

It can be simple tasks like cleaning or making a cup of tea, but something to take your attention away from the looming task until there are only 5-10 minutes left. Those minutes will fly by, and you will probably get some of your nerves back, but it's definitely better than spending all the hours between waking up and the task just worrying about the task. This won't apply to everyone obviously, but I definitely know more than a few people who get anxious over things like the ones I've mentioned, and overthinking it makes it so much worse.
