YSK that even if your cellphone doesn't show any reception, it may still be able to call 911 by using other cell towers, and that any cellphone without a SIM card can still call 911 if there are cell towers nearby.

Often times when your cellphone shows no reception, it may still be able to latch onto OTHER carriers' towers to accept emergency calls. 

So in an emergency where you need to dial 911 and your phone shows no service, try dialling anyways. It may be able to find another cell tower closeby. However if there are no cell towers closeby at all then it will not work. This is also why you should be careful when children are playing with old phones - they may still accidentally call 911! 

CAVEAT for phones without sim cards: **be sure to give the 911 operator a contact number** if possible since your phone will not have any number linked to it and they won't be able to reach you.
