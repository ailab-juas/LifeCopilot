YSK: In many USA grocery stores, there are cheaper spices in the ethnic food sections than the “spice” section

content:
I recently discovered that my (California) grocery store has spices in the Mexican food section for significantly lower prices than they are sold for in the “spices” aisle. Admittedly they come in ziplock bag-type packaging instead of the convenient shaker bottles, but the savings are regularly 3x+, so in the future I’ll be refilling my existing shakers with lower cost spices from the pouches! 

Why YSK: To save money
