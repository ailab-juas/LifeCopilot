YSK If someone informs you they're suicidal, you should take that statement seriously and offer to help

content:
I'm going to go out on a limb here and uncomfortably admit that I personally have dealt with suicidal ideation, in addition to several attempts in the past, and sometimes just having someone care and give a crap can be enough to talk you down from that ledge, so to speak.

Too often people dismiss cries for help and ignore those most in need, hocking it up to being dramatic or simply young. I've known well over 30 people who have taken their own lives and the vast majority of those individuals always reached out for help before deciding to end things, but it either wasn't given or taken seriously enough.

Even if it's just a stranger on the internet, offer to help.

Edit: I just wanted to put this out there - if anyone ever needs someone to talk to about any of this stuff, you can always hit me up. I will honestly respond as quickly as I can and will do my best to help you through any problems you're having.
