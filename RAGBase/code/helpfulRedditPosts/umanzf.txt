YSK: Never try to swim underneath a waterfall. It’s super dangerous and could be deadly.

Why YSK: The pressure of the water falling makes it difficult to swim from out under and could hold you down until you drown. 

Some may think this is a no brainer but that’s not always the case. I grew up where it’s completely flat. So when I first went to visit a waterfall, I was so awestruck and wanted to get as much out of it as I could. I swam closer to the waterfall so I could get underneath it. I was so close I could feel I was starting to get sucked in a little. Thankfully, I was pulled out just in time. If I would have got any closer, I highly doubt I would’ve made it out. It’s been years since this happened but when I think of it, I get freaked out because I could’ve died. So, don’t try to get underneath the part that hits the water no matter how good of a swimmer you think you are or how shallow the water is. Where I was, the water was maybe only 10 ft down at its deepest. The pressure of the water pounding the body of water below is no joke.
