LPT: Don’t avoid people with opposing opinions. Surrounding yourself with people who always agree with you encourages close-mindedness.

content:
Someone recently told me they would never be friends with someone who was a member of the opposing political party. Without even getting to know the person, they made generalizations about their character and beliefs. This is an extremely dangerous and toxic mindset as it pushes stereotypes and creates an unnecessary divide between opposing ideologies. 

Just because someone has a different viewpoint than you does not mean they are a bad person. This is especially the case for politics, but it applies in every aspect of life. If you choose to surround yourself with people that share the same perspective as you, you will never learn to understand the mindset of the opposing perspective. 

It’s natural to gravitate towards people you agree with, but you should push yourself to have open conversations and relationships with people who offer a different opinion than yours.

Edit: many people seem to associate differing political opinions with hatred and discrimination. You shouldn’t have to tolerate those who wish to take your rights away or believe you to be inferior because of your background. That being said, there are many aspects of politics and ethics that do not fall under the umbrella of discrimination. Most of the time, people agree that there is a problem, but they simply disagree on the solution. Push yourself to dig further into these conversations to learn more about opposing perspectives. You may end up disagreeing even further, or you may realize there is more common ground than you had anticipated.
