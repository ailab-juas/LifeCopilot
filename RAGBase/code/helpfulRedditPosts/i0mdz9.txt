LPT: Copy and Paste the Job description when you start a new job to your resume. Add/delete tasks periodically.

content:
It's easy to forget what you do throughout the year. When put on the spot, I even struggle to identify what I do daily because it's just part of my routine. No need to start from scratch when someone has already identified the things you do/should be able to do. Something on the description that you're not actually doing? You could ask to do it if your resume needs a boost. Every time a new duty is asked of me, instead of complaining, I just see it as a resume booster for the future.

Edit to clarify: you should edit and make it presentable before using it on a resume you plan to submit. Not straight copy and paste. This isn't a high school term paper...
