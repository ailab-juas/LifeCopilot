LPT: Tell a spam caller you're recording the call and please could they repeat what they just said.

content:
"Marcus" from "Invest XD" alleged I'd signed up to something to find out about bitcoin. He didn't like thinking I was recording him and hung up immediately. 

I've made a note of the number so I can log it with the TPS and ICO. Apparently the UK government has called on phone companies to put a stop to these calls but the scammers are merely buying up phone numbers from British based networks instead.

Edit: Thanks to those who've pointed out it's probably a spoof number. R/laibo shared the wiki: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID_spoofing

For those recommending just not answering the phone, I was waiting for an Argos delivery and live in a block of flats. It's probably good advice in most situations.
