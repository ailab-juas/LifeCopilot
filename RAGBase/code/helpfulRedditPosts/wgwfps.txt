LPT: You should train yourself to ensure the phrase "Let me think about it" is how you respond to questions or decisions, instead of guessing on the spot what you think is the right call.

content:
We are often caught up in the moment and this can lead to all sorts of negative situations when we are put on the spot. Even if it's just 5 minutes outside a shop before taking up someone on a deal, or a few hours to to consider saying "Yes" to your bosses request, just try and take yourself out of the moment in order to consider decisions.

Most reasonable people will respect you taking appropriate time to consider your options. Do not just blurt out "Yes" or "No" if it's a decision you feel you are being pressured to make on the spot.

Just to add, there are plenty of situations where trusting your gut instinct is completely appropriate, however in many cases your gut instinct may also be to not let the person opposite you down, without considering other ramifications.

Edit: This is not just for work and careers; this applies to every walk of life; ranging from social, financial decisions, relationships and such. This is not some sort of licence to just say “I’ll think about it” to every question posed in the workplace by your boss. Life can exist outside of those situations.
