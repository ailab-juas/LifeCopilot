YSK How to quickly distract yourself from your current stressful situation by wiggling your toes. (Ex: dental work, getting injections, public speaking) X-post from LifeProTips

content:
Wiggling your toes will distract you enough to get through the moment. This is especially useful when getting an adjustment at the chiropractor or during a massage.

Works better than deep breathing or counting for reducing anxiety (for me)! 

(If you find yourself experiencing a lot of anxiety, you might want to see a doctor.)

Edit- **Your toes can help get you through these real life situations!**

-About to have a panic attack because your cab driver is driving like a blind man? Focus on wiggling your toes.

-At the dentist and dreading getting the numbing injection? Focus on wiggling your toes. 

-At the chiropractor and about to get your neck cracked but worried if you don't relax he might break your neck? Focus on wiggling your toes.

-About to take an exam? Wiggle your toes.

-Stomach Aches? Wiggle your toes

-Need to hold in a fart? Wiggle your toes

-Going through the child birthing process? Wiggle your toes...then the rest of your body.

-Toes just cold? Wiggle them!

-Getting a tattoo or piercing? Wiggle them toes!

-Are you John McClaine?  Man! Wiggle your toes!

**EDIT 2- Wow! Front page! Here are even more uses!**

-Doing a squat and need to keep your weight on your heels? Wiggle your toes!

-Need more...ahem... staying power? Wiggle the toes

-Getting lab work done and afraid of needles? You know what to do!

-Getting tickled and need to pretend your not ticklish? Wiggle away!

Any more ideas?
