YSK: If someone has a problem with a simple, obvious solution that they're aware of but not doing, don't tell them to just do the solution. The real problem is the underlying one that prevents them from doing it.

content:
Nobody wants to have problems for no other reason than because having problems is fun. An alcoholic knows that they should just stop drinking, a hoarder knows they should just stop gathering stuff, someone who self-harms knows they should just stop cutting. These are obvious problems with obvious solutions.

Saying "why don't you just [stop the thing/not do that/stop having the problem]" isn't useful advice, and doesn't make the hearer value your opinion. The real problem is an underlying one, a psychological issue that drives them to a harmful behaviour in the first place. Telling someone to simply hide the visible symptom of an underlying issue isn't useful to anyone involved.
