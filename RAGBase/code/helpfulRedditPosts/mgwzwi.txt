YSK that in parenting, HOW you talk to your child matters - it changes their brain. Talking TO or AT your child, even if you are exposing them to many words, is less important than having engaging conversations WITH your child, ideally where your child takes the lead.

**Why YSK:** Parents should know this because there is a widespread misunderstanding about the connection between parental education/income level and child brain and language development. Namely, that higher income/educated parents teach their kids *more words,* and this drives better brain language development. Knowing about this misconception is important for many reasons, perhaps the most important being the following: The science-backed solution to helping grow your child‚Äôs brain development in this area is actually doable/applicable for *any parent, regardless of socioeconomic or educational background.* It has nothing to do with dumping fancy words at your kids.

I‚Äôd safely assume that most parents know that talking - and teaching verbal communication - to their children from a young age is vital. But, there is a widespread misconception that parental income or education correlates to a child‚Äôs ability to develop strongly in this area. Notably, since research has shown that, on average, children from higher-income families hear millions *more words* during their first three years of life, somehow that means that such children are set up for better brain development than children from lower-income families. **This actually isn‚Äôt true.**

In 1995, a research study came out that found that children from higher-income families hear about **30 million more words** during their first three years of life than children from lower-income families.

So was coined the phenomenon of the ‚Äú**30-million-word-gap**‚Äù, at the time correlated with significant gaps in tests of vocabulary, language development, and reading comp skills of kids from lower vs higher income families as they matured. People ran with this idea. Claiming essentially that kids from higher income families, who on average heard and were taught so many more words, were somehow set up as they got older to have a more "highly developed" brain in terms of language capabilities.

More recent science has debunked this correlation, pointing to a very different reality. MIT cognitive scientists have now discovered that *it is not the number of words* a parent says **to** their child that can change their brain (for the better), but instead *the nature of open-ended conversation* a parent encourages **with** their child.

**Creating lots of opportunity for this kind of open-ended, back-and-forth conversation is actually more critical to brain and language development than the findings of the "word gap".** This research from MIT applied to children *regardless of parental income* *or education.* The finding suggests that *any* parent can have considerable influence over their child's language and brain development by simply engaging them in daily conversation where the child has space to drive the conversation and create conversation turns as they please. Encouraging turn-taking conversation, as opposed to one-sided conversation, can be implemented by any parent.

Being interactive is what matters. 

The key finding from the aforementioned research is that parents should understand they should not just *talk to* their child, but instead should consistently *talk with* their child. Creating time and space for casual, story-oriented familial conversation, where there is less talking at or to your child by the parent and more talking with and listening to your child, changes children‚Äôs brains.

Maybe using excessive flashcards and talking at our children with many words, probably just frustrating or confusing them, should be a thing of the past. Maybe the solution is really as simple as focusing on fun conversation that genuinely encourages children to participate. Not just listen and memorize.

\*edit: Parenting is hard. the solution I am pointing to is not "simple"  as I originally said - it takes a lot of energy, time and dedication from parents. It is doable and applicable though to many parents!

**edit: A commenter asked me to clarify my qualifications, and I want to make sure nobody thinks I am overstepping by sharing this research (objective) and my thoughts around it (subjective). I thought this was clear in my writing, but I did not contribute to the MIT study I referenced above. I have a dual BS in Mathematics and Neuroscience and minor in computational bio / bioinformatics from a US university. I am very interested in this subject, but do not have a PHD. The research referenced is not mine. I more so just love to write and read interesting research. That‚Äôs why I shared this post üëçüèº
