LPT: When you know where you are going to college, make sure to decline the others. People often end up on waitlists and the sooner that you decline the more likely they may be to get in. It could be their dream/reach school

EDIT: Please don't deny all schools you get into other than your one you want, leave at least a backup or two in case something happens.
