YSK: Yelp doesn't give away 'award' plaques to restaurants, the restaurant themselves pays Yelp ($150-$300) to receive one.

Got a call yesterday from Yelp buttering me up about how well my rankings/reviews are and how I had 'won' an award. 

Not only does Yelp want me to advertise their company on my restaurant's wall, for free, they want me to pay for an overpriced plaque ($150-$300 nonetheless!)

I said I might hang it up if it was free the guy said:
 "well, that wouldn't make any sense." 

Me: "Name one award where the recipient has to pay for their trophy?"

Yelp: "You have a pleasant afternoon Mr. *****"






Edit: Wow... Heh, glad I could spread the word; now people know.

Also, in response to everyone saying the Oscars, Grammys, Hollywood Star are the same thing, it's not, Yelp's deal is straight up backwards. The hollywood star (grammy, oscar, whatever rigged award) is paying to have your own name advertised on someone else's property (fair, logical) vs. a company wanting me to pay for their advertisement on my property (lol.)

(then again, anyone wearing clothes with huge logos is doing the same thing, but at least they get a shirt out of the deal.)
