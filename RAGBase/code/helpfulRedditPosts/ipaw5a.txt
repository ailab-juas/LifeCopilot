LPT: Sunk costs is a concept in finance that applies to real life relationships too. You don't need to stay in a bad investment just because you invested in it. Just because you gave a person 5 years in your past, you don't need to give them 5 years of your future. You can walk away anytime.

Limit your losses. The past is irrelevant to the future.
