YSK: If you're a teenage girl and need access to emergency contraceptive you can buy Plan B on Amazon for $30 compared to having an adult go in and buy it for you for $60

content:
Given you'll need to buy it before you actually need it I figured this bit of info is still helpful. In many states they won't allow you to buy it if you're not 18 or older. Regardless it's $60 in the store vs a much cheaper rate online.

Edit: Thank you kind gold giving stranger's
