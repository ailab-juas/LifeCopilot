LPT: How to enjoy your deck, without getting bitten my mosquitos

content:
Mosquitos are generally pretty weak flyers.  They get blown away in something like a 3mph breeze.

Point a fan at you while you're on your deck.  Even better if you have several fans oscillating.  That way your whole deck will be a swirling mass of air that mosquitos can't negotiate.

We've been doing this for years.  Only recently people have started asking us how we manage to beat the mosquitos... we thought it was common knowledge... so now it is!
