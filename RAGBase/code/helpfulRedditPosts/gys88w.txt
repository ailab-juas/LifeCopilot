YSK if someone has a lien on your car and they sell it for more than you owe, you are legally entitled to the profit

For example, your car gets repoed because you owe $2,000. The repo people sell it for $3,000. You are entitled to that $1,000.

Naturally, this example doesn't account for storage fees or repo fees or anything. 

My friend is a tow truck driver and does a lot of private property impounds, which is someone parks somewhere without permission, and many cars impounded go to auction and never get claimed. 

Recently he impounded a brand new RV, his company kept $4,600 on impound, sold the RV $10,000 and the owner of the RV never claimed his $5,400 of money he was owed.
