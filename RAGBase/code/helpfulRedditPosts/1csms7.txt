YSK: The 5 stages of grief associated with mourning and loss are not just for when someone close to you dies. Any major change to your life (positive or negative) may necessitate you going through these stages.

content:
We get comfortable with what is familiar in our lives.  When things change for the good or for the bad, it is completely normal for a human being to grieve the loss of what was because we are losing something so familiar that it adds to our (false) sense of security in life.  First, know and expect these 5 stages.  It can be very disorienting if this happens to you and you are not expecting it and don't know what it is.  It can quite literally feel as if the rug has been pulled out from under you.  Second, figure out ways to process through the 5 stages in healthy vs. destructive ways.  Third, do your best not to confuse the symptoms of this completely normal and temporary process with mental illness.  Depression is one of the 5 stages.  Many people go straight for anti-depressants.  Get into therapy to discuss what you are feeling if you are having trouble coping.  Here is a link which describes the 5 stages, but you can find them in more detail abundantly on the web.  http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/
