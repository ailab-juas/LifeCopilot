YSK The addiction cycle is easily reignited by precontemplation (the moment your old addiction first pops into your head). What follows is Contemplation, Determination, Action, Maintenance, and finally Relapse.

content:
Why YSK: You can break addictions by noticing the early signs. If you can, tell your partner what your trigger is when you find it so that they can be on the lookout with you.

This is exactly the pattern my personal addiction follows, and it adheres perfectly to the typical model researchers have found. Does it sound familiar?

Bonus point for those who made it this far! Advertisements are artificial precontemplation triggers, targeted at ex-addicts.
