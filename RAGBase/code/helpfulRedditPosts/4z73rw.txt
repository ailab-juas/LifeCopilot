title:
YSK that if you have an elderly loved one driving dangerously, in most US States you can request the DMV to send a reexamination request for that driver.

content:
If grandpa can't handle you criticizing their driving and asking him to stop, you can make the DMV the bad guy by asking them to request a driving test. Could save your family a lot of grief.

Edit: Another option depending on the state, is to call non-emergency police and have them follow your crotchety driver around until they make an error. The driving violation then gives cause for the reexamination. But double check with DMV first as to the best method in your state, otherwise you'll get some cranky popo on the phone.
