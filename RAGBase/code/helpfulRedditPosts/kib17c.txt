YSK that if your dog eats cooked bones, give them bread. It could save their life.

content:
Long story short, my dog got ahold of a cooked bone. A big ol’ ham bone. She obliterated it. After some Googling, I found that you should immediately give them bread. 

I shoved bread down her gullet until she looked like she was pregnant. My vet commended the move and said with how much bone she ate and how much had splintered, the bread saved her life. And if not her life, it saved me from having to pay $3k+ for surgeries. A $3 loaf of bread saved my dog’s life. Crazy to think about. 

Why YSK: From my understanding, the bread “absorbs” the bone and keeps it from puncturing anything by essentially padding it. They may still need surgery to remove any big or sharp pieces, but it’s better than needing additional surgery for a puncture. 

**You of course should still bring your dog to the vet asap**, but all she ended up needing was some x-rays and pain meds. A shitty situation ended better than it could have.

Edit: **THIS ONLY APPLIES TO _COOKED_ BONES**

Edit 2: Also bird bones are never good.
