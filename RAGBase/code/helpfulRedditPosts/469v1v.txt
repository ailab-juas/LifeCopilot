LPT: Don't validate people's delusions by getting angry or frustrated with them

content:
You'll perpetuate conflict and draw yourself into an argument that quickly becomes all about countering the other person's every claim. Stick to a few simple facts that support your argument and let them reflect on that.

Edit: I have learned so many great quotes today.

Edit 2: You may not change the other person's mind but you will spare yourself a lot of conflict and stress.
