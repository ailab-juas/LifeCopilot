Why YSK: [Dark Patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/) are quite prevalent in even the most regularly used websites. How many times have you logged onto a website with an intent to do A but the site tries to lead you to B instead? How many times have you had those "I didn't opt for this" moments during online shopping? This website will help you understand such tricks and be more informed against them.

Note: I'm in no way associated with the website. Just helping spread some good information.

Edit: Wow this got to the Front page! Thanks everyone for helping spread this. Thanks for the generous awards too.
