LPT: If a credit card of finance offer excludes residents of Iowa, you probably shouldn’t apply.

content:
If you pay close enough attention, you might notice that a fair amount of finance offers exclude Iowa residents. This is because Iowa has some of the most robust consumer credit laws around that - among other things - put limits on interest rates and late payment penalties, AKA, helping prevent predatory loan practices. This isn’t to say that *all* companies who don’t do business with Iowa residents are predatory, but I don’t think I’d want to take out a loan with a company that won’t do business with consumers who have laws that protect them from being abused by creditors.
