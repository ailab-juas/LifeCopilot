LPT: Flood-damaged cars will be available soon.

content:
If you are looking to purchase a car anywhere, be aware of the tricks used to sell flood destroyed cars.

It is easy for unscrupulous people to "scrub" the title by moving a car to another state or country, and conceal the most obvious damage for a quick sale.

One way I look for this is to reach my hand up into the area above where the passengers' feet go, and feel around. If my hand comes out with soil, the car has likely been submerged. (a little black film is normal in older cars, brown dirt is not)
  You can also feel inside the wheel wells, using a rag, to look for mud and residue.
