YSK If you have Sprint as a mobile provider that around April of ‘19 they started adding 2 billable services without consent, totally $17 per month. If persistent, you can have all charges reversed. Check your bill!

content:
They added a service called “Safe and Found” ($6.99) and “Lookout Premium” ($9.99) onto my bill without authorization. It took about an hour with their chat, but they finally relented to fill refund of $136 after I threatened to cancel service and report them to the FTC and BBB.

Edit: To all the people arguing against BBB. I don’t care if they don’t have integrity or fair rankings. It was a threat to get them to take this seriously. That’s all.
