YSK: being asked to become manager of your team is not a promotion, it’s a career change.

content:
Why YSK: even though you will remain in the same field of work and working with the same people, your new job requires a very different skill set from you while dealing with different problems. I’ve seen too many people being ‘promoted’ to manager only to discover they hate managing people and dealing with HR and finances. After a few months they leave the company because returning to a normal employee seems like a step back/failing for them.
