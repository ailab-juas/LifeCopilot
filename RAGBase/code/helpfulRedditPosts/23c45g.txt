LPT: Look at their shoes. [Miscellaneous]

Pretty awful that I know this, but I hope it helps people. It has helped me recover product that has been stolen from my work, and identifying shoplifters before they even come into the premises. 

If you are ever in a confrontational situation in which you may need to describe someone to the police, look at their shoes. If you are robbed, mugged, shoplifted from, snatch-and-grabbed, beaten up, randomly attacked, molested, groped, etc. by a stranger, this will help them identify the suspect more easily. Most known shoplifters and violent or sex offenders will change their clothes after an attack, and jackets and sweaters are easy to take off or turn inside out, but shoes are expensive, and most people do not carry an extra set around. Having this information along with a basic description of the individual can help greatly with an investigation, and the suspect won't go all insane on you because you aren't staring them in the face.
