YSK - If you are struggling with talking to your children about sex and their bodies, Planned Parenthood’s website is an amazing source of information for this.

If you go to their Learning section and click on ‘For Parents’, they have detailed information that is separated by age groups. 

A lot of parents have a hard time doing this.  It’s awkward for everyone.  But the earlier it is started, even with simple quick conversations about body parts with a toddler, the easier it will get.  Having regular conversations like this will also encourage your children to open up to you when they have questions.
