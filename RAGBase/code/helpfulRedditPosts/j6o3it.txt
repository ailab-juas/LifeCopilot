LPT: When you marry someone, you also marry their family. Make your peace with that before saying "I do".

content:
I read this in a book once and feel it holds very true. When you start thinking about long term plans like marriage, unless your partner intends to cut off contact with them, you will have to deal with their family at some point. If you have constant friction with your in-laws and can't ever see yourself getting along with them, have an honest reflection on how you see the rest of your relationship pan out with their family in the picture. If you think you and your partner can manage it as a team, by all means go ahead, but definitely have a dialogue about it before committing.
