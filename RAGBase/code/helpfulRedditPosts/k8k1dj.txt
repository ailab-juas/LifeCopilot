LPT: If someone gifts you a book, make sure you open it. Lots on people put notes or gifts (like money) in the pages of books when they give them as gifts.

content:
I have seen a handful of people, myself included, miss out on cash or heartfelt notes in a gifted book simply because they hadn’t opened it up. Always at least skim through the pages and make sure to give them a thank you when you find what’s hidden in it. 

And if there’s no notes, at least you have a new book!


Edit: dang, thank you ladies and gents, didn’t think this would get any attention, thanks for the awards!

Also while I’ve got your attention, if any of you found some extra dough in unopened books you should consider donating it to your local food banks. Lots of people could use the helping hand right now! [Feeding America](www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank) , [Global FoodBanking Network](www.foodbanking.org) 

Stay safe and healthy!
