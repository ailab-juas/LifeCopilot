YSK when telling someone “let me know if you need anything”, it’s best to instead offer to do a specific thing you know would be helpful.

Why YSK: Many people struggle to ask for help and if they’re already overwhelmed, they might not know where to start.

I’ve tried to say things like, can I come over and help fold or hang up laundry, or can I bring you dinner tomorrow, I’ll pick you up a coffee in the morning, can I pick the kids up for school, etc.
