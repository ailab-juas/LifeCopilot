Use Socratic questioning as a way to defend your position/win arguments/get people to see things from your perspective

content:
You know how teachers have that annoying habit of asking lots of questions? *Why do you think this is? How do you think he felt?* etc.

It's actually a method of teaching and a very effective way of winning arguments against the unsuspecting. For example, let's say your girlfriend is angry about you coming home late one night. She says, *You didn't call me! I was so worried, and you were probably out at the bar hitting on girls!*

You could respond, *No baby, I wasn't, I swear.* But effectively this is two heads butting; the one with greater force wins.

Instead, ask questions. This puts you in a position of control without being aggressive, and forces the listener to accept their own hypocrisy/flawed reasoning.

Say something like: *Why are you upset? What do you think I was doing? Is it that I'm late that bothers you, or that you can't trust me?*

Rather than arguing back and forth, you're encouraging her to express how she feels, and it seems like you're making an effort to listen. Eventually she'll either forgive you, or you'll see that you were wrong, or she'll see that she was being unreasonable.

I gave a very sexist example, but this works for heated debates as well. Rather than saying, *Animals aren't meant to be in captivity,* say, *Do you think animals were meant to be in captivity?* Wording your point of view in the form of a question forces them to see it from your perspective whether they like it or not, because a question psychologically puts them in a position where they have to answer it.

Also useful when teaching your kid. Instead of just explaining how the world works, arrange your questions as a guide for your child to figure it out on their own. Questions are powerful, powerful things when used correctly. Takes a bit of effort to think them through, but after a bit of practice, it becomes second-nature. Just don't overdo it.

**edit: blablabla, front page, wasn't expecting this. My example wasn't very good -- use the questions sparingly and at the appropriate time, as many comments below have pointed out. Obviously answering *everything* with a question will result in a redditor punching you in the face.  Thank you for reading, I'm Ron Burgundy?**
