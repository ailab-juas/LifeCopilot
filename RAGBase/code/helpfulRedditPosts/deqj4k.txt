YSK to always have your valuables in your right pocket when in a city with pickpockets.

content:
90% of the world is right-handed and if you're forced to steal from a pocket on the right side of someone they'll have to use their left hand. For skilled pickpockets, stealing with the left hand isn't a problem, but if there is just a little more risk trying to steal from you, the theif will most likely choose someone else from the thousands of victims.
