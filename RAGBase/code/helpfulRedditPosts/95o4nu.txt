YSK that the Waze app will provide audible alerts if you exceed the speed limit (it's disabled by default)

content:
If you use Waze for directions then this is a nice bonus.  In the [Speedometer settings](https://i.imgur.com/g0nqFDc.jpg) you can enable audible alerts if you exceed the speed limit.  The app lets you choose from several options: at the speed limit, 5 miles over, 10 miles over, 5% over, 10% over, for 15% over. Even when the app is not showing on the screen a sound will be played when you reach be specified setting.

Be aware, however, that you won't receive another sound notification unless you drop below the speed limit.
