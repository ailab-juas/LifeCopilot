LPT: If there are home improvement projects around the house you have been putting off do them now if you ever plan to move.

content:
So we have known for quite a while that we would be needing to move into a larger house for our growing family. Our 3 Bed 2 bath 1200 sq ft house was great for my wife and I, okay when our son came along, and way too small once our daughter joined us.

We put an offer on a larger house, had it accepted, and now have to get our house ready to list: which brings me to the subject of this LPT. All the projects you have been putting off are going to need to be done before you sell.

I now find myself rushing to re-finish the deck, put a new floor in the master bath, and breaking my back to clean up the backyard all in a house we won't be in for more than a couple of months.

Do these projects when you think of them: you will have time to enjoy the fruits of your labor and your house will be ready to fetch top dollar. Not to mention you won't be rushing to get these things done while under all the added stress of the closing and mortgage approval process.

Cheers!
