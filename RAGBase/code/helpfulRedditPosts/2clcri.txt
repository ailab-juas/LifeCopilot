YSK that, in principle, Jews, Muslims, and Christians all believe in and worship the same God of the Old Testament.

For most, this is nothing newâ€”because, after all, all three are Abrahamic religions. However, what I have discovered (through dialogue) about more and more people, especially younger ones, is that this insight has been lost and/or forgotten. Most seem to acknowledge a close connection between Judaism and Christianity, but fail to make the same connection to Islam. This alienation of Islam is very troublesome, IMO. To me, it seems like there's no better time than now, to lay this knowledge on Redditors.

A little light reading: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Abrahamic_religions

Edit: wow, I wasn't really expecting this kind of response. I'd like to insert a caveat: and that is I am no "scholar" in the field, per se, just a ferocious reader. I would absolutely defer any serious inquiries to actual scholars. So, without further ado, I present a fantastic conversation with Reza Aslan: http://www.c-span.org/video/?319745-1/depth-reza-aslan Also, /r/askhistorians would be another place I'd defer any more serious inquiries.
