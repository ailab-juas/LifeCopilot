YSK that the best time to photograph your Christmas lights is at dusk, not when it's fully dark out.

Why YSK: I see so many absolutely horrible photos of holiday decorations that people have clearly spent a lot of hard work on.  Put your best foot forward when photographing them to share with family, friends, and internet strangers!

Photographing your lights at night just makes for a lopsided exposure - either the lights look okay and everything else is really dark, or the scene looks right but the lights are blown out.  Go outside at dusk and photograph your lit-up display then; you'll see all of the lights looking beautiful and you'll also get a nice glow from the rest of the photo (your house, your yard, etc).

Obviously using a tripod and a manual camera can help even more, but timing your photographs this way is the easiest way to get significantly better looking pictures of your sweet holiday displays even if you're just taking pictures with your phone.

edit: wow, I did not expect such a large response to this. I'm still not entirely clear on what the little awards do, but they made me smile, so thanks internet strangers!
