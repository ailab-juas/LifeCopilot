LPT: If you find yourself 'in a rut' don't aim to make a bucket list. Make this.

I don't have a cool name for my list, but if somebody has one, I'll use it lol.


Anyway, I work an office job with long hours, not enough pay, etc, etc. Pretty soon, I found myself in a rut. Clock in, meal start, meal end, restart. (My sad attempt at a poem) 


I came up with a solution. I made a list of thing I did manage to do and when. I looked at this list, and made it a challenge to add something at least once a week. They didn't need to be incredible things, just things that were fun or different. I find that I have forced my way out of a rut. 


Here's an example, with real things in my list.


Feb 5, 2016 - - - Bought a longboard after many years of wanting to get into the sport.

Feb 8, 2016 - - - Taught myself not only how to stay on the board, but how to push and pick up speed. (still can't stop) 

Feb 14, 2016 - - - Went on a hike. 

Feb 20, 2016 - - - Bought a drawing set. Learning to draw. 

Mar 1, 2016 - - - Went down my first hill on my longboard. Reached 15mph (according to an app) got the speed wobbles, but stayed on. 

Mar 3, 2016 - - - Got snacks from Australia. 


Hope this helps you guys as much as it helps me.
