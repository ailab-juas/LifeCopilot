LPT: Take a screenshot of your mobile boarding pass to save it as a photo on your mobile device for quick and easy access.

Too many times have I seen people fumbling with their phone trying to get into their mobile boarding pass. Either they have no, or low, signal and it takes forever to load. 

I've found loading the boarding pass well in advance and taking a screenshot of it on my phone makes it super simple to get at as well as no internet needed.
