title:
LPT DO NOT skip home inspection when buying

content:
This is a giant mistake and I’m reading horror stories all over the place. If the realtors or the owner suggest skipping inspection I’d move on. They just want their money and not at all concerned with your time or you. An inspection can save you time and a whole lot of money. For example: we bought our house in November 2020. After inspection (that lasted 4 hours) we were made aware of fireplace damage that we were told would cost an estimated $15k. Guess what we used to our advantage? We were able to get a full sellers assist, buy down our interest rate, and never had to repair the chimney because it’s not crucial. DO NOT SKIP HOME INSPECTION
