YSK: Many states consider a significant reduction in pay a "constructive dismissal" - if your employer reduces your wages due to the stimulus, you may be able to file under unemployment insurance.

**EDIT #3: I originally left this section out because I didn't want to flood the OP with state-specific information, but there's concern about the wiki link. Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all source. Different localities approach this differently.**

&gt;Working Reduced Hours
&gt;If you are working but your employer reduced your hours, you may be eligible for benefits. Your reduction in hours must not be the result of a disciplinary action or due to your request.

So if your hours are reduced, you can claim. 

Next, if your pay rate is reduced here:

&gt;Reductions in the pay rate are legal, but should never be retroactive (see below). Remember that pay cuts of 20% or more may give an employee good cause connected with the work to **quit and qualify for unemployment benefits**. Notice of any changes in the pay rate should always be in writing, for the company's own protection, in order to minimize disputes over the rate of pay.

**YOUR STATE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN CERTAIN WAYS**

Obviously, check your local laws to confirm. It's also worth noting that the stimulus package adds a static $600 to your unemployment benefits. You may be eligible to claim *more* than your typical wages for the next few months.

Edit to mention: also worth noting that employers cannot reduce wages for hours already worked (in the US, at least). This is only if they try reducing your future rate.

Edit #2: There are a lot of specific questions in the comments, but everyone would be better off contacting their own state's unemployment office for more information. I am not a lawyer, and generally advice taken from the internet needs to be followed up by professionals *in your locality*. I know it's a stressful time and the phones are overloaded there, but that's really your best shot. This "YSK" is only to spread awareness of a little-known unemployment reason that covers you in case of your employer being shady.
