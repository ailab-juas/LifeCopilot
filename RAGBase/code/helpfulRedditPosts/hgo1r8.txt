YSK that Early Childhood Education has been in a constant state of crisis. 80% of the child's brain is developed by age 3. And 90% by age 5. Early childhood educators are literally building our next generation of children... And yet they have the lowest projected earnings of all college graduates.

So if you have a kid in daycare or preschool, remember this, and have more patience and just all around treat ECE teachers better, have appreciation for the hard back breaking work they do for pennies. Many have second jobs and are living at or below poverty lines. We need to invest in high quality ECE and pay the teachers what they deserve! 

Edit 1: I just want to disclaim, I'm in the U.S. and am speaking on the ECE field in the U.S. only

Edit 2: here are some sources that will help you better understand early childhood brain development:

~ [this video](https://youtu.be/VNNsN9IJkws) from the Harvard University Center for the Developing Child really breaks it down clearly and accurately.

~ [From the Urban Child Institute](http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/why-0-3/baby-and-brain#:~:text=Between%20conception%20and%20age%20three,percent%20of%20its%20adult%20volume.)
Between conception and age three, a childâ€™s brain undergoes an impressive amount of change. At birth, it already has about all of the neurons it will ever have. It doubles in size in the first year, and by age three it has reached 80 percent of its adult volume.
Even more importantly, synapses are formed at a faster rate during these years than at any other time. In fact, the brain creates many more of them than it needs: at age two or three, the brain has up to twice as many synapses as it will have in adulthood (Figure 3). These surplus connections are gradually eliminated throughout childhood and adolescence, a process sometimes referred to as blooming and pruning.
