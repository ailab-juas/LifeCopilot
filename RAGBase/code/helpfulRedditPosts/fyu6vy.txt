title:
LPT don’t force kids to hug you/show you affection. They will like you better after that

content:
I’ve noticed sometimes when I’m around someone’s child they will be extremely shy and their parent scolds them to give me a hug. I always tell the parent no, if they don’t want to they don’t have to and smile at the child after to show them I’m not upset and there is no pressure to make them uncomfortable. The kid usually seems very relieved and will most likely interact with you on their own basis and be a lot happier.
