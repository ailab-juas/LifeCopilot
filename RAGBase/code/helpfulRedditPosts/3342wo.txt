LPT: Always place the spare tyre under your car when jacking. Stops the car falling on you and keeps it off the ground if it does fall off the jack.

Luckily I've never had a car fall off the jack, but it at the very least stops [this](http://i.imgur.com/xdYKoy0.jpg) happening [via /r/Justrolledintotheshop].

Edit: just to be clear, I'm only talking about when changing a tyre, obviously you want something more stable if you're going to work under the car. 

EDIT: I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR, PARTICULARLY FOR EVERYONE SAYING USE JACK STANDS, THAT I AM ONLY SUGGESTING YOU USE THIS TIP WHEN CHANGING A SPARE TYRE AND NOT THAT YOU SHOULD BE WORKING UNDER YOUR CAR WHILE ITS BEING HELD BY A JACK. I've seen plenty of people changing a tyre who end up with their hands, feet or even head under the car - I always point out how terrible an idea it is to do that. I wrote this tip assuming some level of common sense, but apparently that's hard to find here..

I work in emergency services, and whenever there's two ways to prevent injury, we use both; proper training says never put yourself under anything you're lifting, but also when jacking a car having the spare under the car gives you extra safety and means you avoid what's happened in the pic linked above.
