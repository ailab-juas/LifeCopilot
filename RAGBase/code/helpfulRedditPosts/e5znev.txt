YSK that a percent increase in a statistic may not mean what you think. If 10% of people like chocolate milk more than strawberry but there was an 80% increase over the last year, now 18% of people like chocolate milk, not 90%.

This may be obvious to you but to a lot of people it's new information, which is okay because it's easy to see a statistic and not think of it too much. I myself used to be the same way and most of the people I talk to thought the same thing as well.
