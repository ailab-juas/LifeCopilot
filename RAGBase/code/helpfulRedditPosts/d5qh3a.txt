title:
YSK to cut your toenails straight across rather than curved to prevent ingrown toenails

content:
EDIT4: I thought this would go without saying but clearly not, if cutting them curved works for you then keep doing that. If you don’t like your nails straight across don’t do this. Find what works best for you, this is just something that a lot of people find beneficial.

[Here's an example of how to cut them](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/de/34/21/de3421ef700135625ffb74b7e6768981.png)

I'm a nurse and I see it way too often that people need wedge resections to remove ingrown toenails. This is an extremely painful procedure and one you do NOT want to go through.

The two main causes I see are people cutting their nails too short, and curved on the sides, and people wearing shoes that are too tight.

If you cut them straight across and not too short you'll save yourself a lot of discomfort.

EDIT: If you are worried about your nails please see a doctor or a podiatrist, I am not going to give out specific medical advice online as it is not appropriate.

EDIT2: I have had quite a few people messaging me trying to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about, I urge you to seek out information for yourself. Also, the procedure for the VAST majority of people is painful due to the numbing needles they have to give in what is called a 'ring block'. Whilst it is unpleasant it is sometimes the only option. If you didn't experience pain when you had it done that's great, I am happy for you and only speaking from years of experience.

EDIT3: This is not to scare people who already have ingrown toenails, I promise whilst it’s painful the pain doesn’t last long. Once it’s fixed you can work on preventing it happening again, but leaving an ingrown toenail to get worse is never a good idea and often just as painful as this procedure...
