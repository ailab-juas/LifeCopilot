YSK: To always turn on your headlights while it's raining outside

content:
Why YSK: If it's raining out and you don't have your headlights on, chances are semi trucks will not see you at all in their mirrors. This is obviously very dangerous. I will link a picture showing just how invisible a car with no headlights during rain is.

Also, I'm sure you've heard it before but it seems alot of people think it doesn't apply to them. Do not cut off semi trucks. It very well could be the last thing you ever do. Also give us some room on the highways. I know it's a bit inconvenient with how slow we are sometimes but without us trucks, life as you know it would come to a grinding halt. Every single item that you use, eat, wear, consume, wash with, play with, live in, etc has all been delivered by a semi truck. The world completely stops living without us out here on these roads. Cut us some slack. Please.
