YSK that a red line moving towards the center of your body from an insect bite, scratch or any skin related wound, is a sign of a serious infection. Go see a doctor!

Throughout my life, I have been very prone to the infamous red line that was [seen on the front page](https://np.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/99nrc9/a_mosquito_bit_my_vein_and_the_venom_travels_down/e4p87sn/?st=JL6SM38E&amp;sh=97b932c4) today. I've had at least 9 of them... some very serious, some not so much. 

The red line is a form of Lymphangitis. This is a bacterial infection that spreads up the lymph channels. Gives a red line that goes up the arm or leg. More serious because the infection can get into the bloodstream. (This is called sepsis.)

What I do to prevent the line from forming:  


1). DO NOT ~~ITCH~~ SCRATCH IT. ~~Itching~~ Scratching the wound or bite increases the odds of bacteria entering the afflicted spot.  


2). Put triple antibiotic cream on the affected area. This helps reduce the amount of bacteria capable of entering the afflicted area. If the line does not go away after a day, go to the doctor or hospital to get it checked out!  

The first time this happened to me, the line made it from my foot to my groin and I could not move my leg. The doctors gave me an extremely painful shot and mentioned that it could've killed me had it made it past my lymphnodes in my groin!

Watch your bug bites people!
