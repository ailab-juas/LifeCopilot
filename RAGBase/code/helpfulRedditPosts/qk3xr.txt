LPT: For a cleaner home with little effort, never leave a room empty-handed. There is almost always something you can put back in its place on your way.

content:
Grab that coffee cup, wrapper, piece of mail, etc. on your way out of a room into the room where it belongs. This seems obvious, but I have been consciously doing this for a few days and my home is so much more organized without me having had to devote time specifically to cleaning.
