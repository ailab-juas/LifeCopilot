LPT: Say people's name when you meet them, they feel good about being noticed, you avoid being awkward in the place, and you'll actually start remembering names!

content:
You might need a quick stalk or ask to obtain the name, though.

Edit: to clarify, about remembering names; this is not a LPT to remember names short term, but long term. So for the first few times, you need to figure out your own way of how to remember those names (but the fact that you keep saying their names perhaps once pr day, helps it stick!

Also, I'm not saying to say their names awkwardly often. Just like with compliments, once per day in the greeting is enough.
