LPT: When you get a new bag of zip ties (cable ties) cut (or rip) a hole in the center of the bag not the end. This will prevent any zip ties from falling out in any condition.

We've all done it. Gone to grab a zippie (zip tie) and we find they have fallen out and zippies are everywhwere.  Using the above method will mean you never have to deal with loose zippies everywhere again! And yes some bag have a re-sealable top but they can fail or you can get lazy and close it up everytime.
