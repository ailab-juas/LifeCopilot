YSK - You may have unclaimed money if you live in the USA

[senatorskeletor](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4myp4v/what_is_surprisingly_not_bullshit/d3zit3m) pointed this out in an AskReddit thread, here is his text

"Every U.S. state holds onto money that people are owed and haven't claimed. Including from third-parties. You just have to go to their website and look yourself up. I got $500 from a computer company I bought a laptop from once, and a few other small payments too... and don't forget to look at "Search by State." You may not have anything coming to you... but you might!"

I was able to find several listings for my family members. Total came out to ~$200, so it was a nice find.

I suggest you only put your name and keep the rest blank because if you have moved a lot it may have a listing for you under a former address.
