**Edit Edit:** Apparently [New York](https://dol.ny.gov/online-learning-coursera) and [Iowa](https://www.iowaworkforcedevelopment.gov/iowaworks-begin-offering-grow-google-training-certificates-no-cost-help-job-seekers-fill-high-demand) offer similar programs as well! Thanks to u/Ravenseye and u/Padankadank for pointing these out :). TLDR - make sure to check out your local / state govt's resources even if you're not in California, you might just be surprised. 

Why YSK: Coursera is a one of the biggest providers of MOOC's (massive open online courses) out there, and has thousands of courses on a wide variety of topics from machine learning to mental health and wellbeing. It can prove invaluable for anyone wanting to switch careers, and while it's not necessarily a free ticket to a job, it comes pretty damn close to getting you one. You can see if your local public library offers this service [on this page](https://library.ca.gov/services/to-public/career-pathways/#map), and follow the directions particular to your local library.

I can't believe that I went this long without knowing this existed; I literally stumbled upon this in the comments section of an unrelated reddit post today lol. Hope this helps someone!
