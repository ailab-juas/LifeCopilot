Why YSK: The cleanup is your signature of sorts. After you come to someone's house or place of business, do a job, but if you leave a mess, or leave a tool or any kind of byproduct from the job you had done, it makes you look like an amateur and I'm sure this person will never hire you again or say any good things about you to their friends or community. Clean up 100% after your work, and people will remember that
