[LPT] Surviving an Active Shooter Event

content:
"If you are to ever find yourself in the middle of an active shooter event, your survival may depend on whether or not you have a plan. The plan doesn't have to be complicated. There are three things you could do that make a difference: Run. Hide. Fight."  
  
**RUN**. When an active shooter is in your vicinity:  
  
* If there is an escape path, attempt to evacuate.  
* Evacuate whether others agree to or not.  
* Leave your belongings behind.  
* Help others escape if possible.  
* Prevent others from entering the area.  
* Call 9-1-1 when you are safe. 
   
**HIDE**. If an evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide.  
  
* Lock and/or blockade the door.
* Silence your cell phone.  
* Hide behind large objects.  
* Remain very quiet.  
  
*Your hiding place should:*  
  
* Be out of the shooterâ€™s view.  
* Provide protection of shots are fired in your direction.  
* Not trap or restrict your options for movement.  
  
**FIGHT**. As a last resort, and only if your life is in danger:  
  
* Attempt to incapacitate the shooter.  
* Act with physical aggression.  
* Improvise weapons.  
* Commit to your actions.
