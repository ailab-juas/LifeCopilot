YSK restaurants worry about regulars who stop ordering.

content:
I work at a restaurant and we recently lost a customer. He would order 5-6 times a week every week for the last 10+years. All of a sudden 2 weeks pass and he has not ordered. We all worried about it and were talking about it at work for a while. Finally we got an order from his home, but sadly it was his wife. He had passed away but his wife was nice enough to call and let us know, and order one last time before she moved.

This happens from time to time and its a shame that there is no good way for us, as restaurateurs, to know if we have lost a customer for health reasons. If a loved one has passed recently and you know they had a favorite restaurant please let them know. I will guarantee they will be grateful to know.
