title:
YSK that Wikipedia has useful summaries of world news and current affairs for every single day in recent history, with links to further reading.

content:
This dynamic page compiles events from the past week:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events

And you can go "back in time" with */wiki/Month_Year*.
For example:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2012

I've found this invaluable for catching up on events that pass me by, and to find relevant further reading and explanation of current issues/topics. It's also far more impartial than conventional news sources, covering the far-flung events that are considered irrelevant or un-newsworthy that might otherwise be passed by.
