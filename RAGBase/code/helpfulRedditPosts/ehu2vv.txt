LPT: When you get someone on the line of a 1-800 number, always begin with: "I'm calling because &lt;insert paraphrased reason for calling here&gt;. Is that something you can help me with?" Many people start explaining detailed stories to the wrong department, only to be redirected and start over.

If you've been directed to the wrong department, they'll quickly be able to re-direct you and save everyone time. Additionally, if they need any more information from you (phone number, account number, etc.) before helping you, you've given them a moment to gather that information before proceeding.
