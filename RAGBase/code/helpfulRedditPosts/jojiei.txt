LPT: If you’re trying to distract yourself from anxiety by using your hands, pick something that you’re a beginner at.

I was trying to distract myself from election returns and stop myself from pacing around my apartment, so I first tried playing the piano. I’m a pianist and quickly recognized that while my fingers were occupied, my mind was free to roam and build up more anxiety. I switched to knitting (which I suck at) and it really worked - I had to seriously focus on what I was doing, which helped distract me.
