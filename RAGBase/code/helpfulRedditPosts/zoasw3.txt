LPT: If someone gives more than 1 excuse, it's more than likely they don't want to do whatever it is (and you should just drop it).

content:
I know this might sound obvious but I encounter a lot of people who don't realize / understand this. If someone makes plans and a person says they can't and someone else asks why and they give an excuse and the person gives a solution, but they still find another excuse, they probably just don't want to do it for whatever reason and they shouldn't keep being pushed and made feeling akward. Sometimes people have reasons for not wanting to do things that they don't want to share and that's fine.

Edit: Note: While ideally they wouldn't ask why after saying no, s people have very pushy friends (or just people in their life) that will always ask why when given a no.

Edit #2: Note: I agree people ideally shouldn't make excuses but they often are scared or have a hard time saying no and pestering them about their excuses won't accomplish anything.
