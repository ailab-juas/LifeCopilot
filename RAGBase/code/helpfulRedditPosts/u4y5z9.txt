title:
YSK brushing your teeth with too much pressure can cause more harm than good. Brushing your teeth too hard can cause issues like scratched enamel and gum degeneration. Thereâ€™s also very frail tissue where the tooth and the gum meet, and that will just wear away if you brush too aggressively.

content:
Why YSK: 50 percent of US adults aged 18 and older have some form of gum recession, which can lead to pain and serious long term problems. The easiest thing you can do to help is to brush with the correct amount of pressure in order to avoid damaging the gums and tooth enamel, while still eliminating the plaque.
