LPT: On your last day in a foreign country you have visited, collect all your loose coins and give it all to a homeless person.

content:
It won't serve much of a purpose to you later, it might just sit in a jar somewhere- for this lucky person it might mean the first decent meal in weeks. Trust me the feeling of throwing down a handful of coins in front of someone, of seeing the surprised smile on his/her face as he/she praises and blesses you in the name of whatever his or her god/s might be, of walking into the night with a big smile on your own face as a result of the experience.

Worth a few useless chunks of metal for that.

EDIT: I do realise I have missed quite a few things about this, just wanted to make it short and sweet- I wouldn't give it to anyone who was clearly a drug/nicotine addict or alcoholic, not quite that naive but I do realise its always a bit of a gamble as to who is legit or not. Point is that the coins will be worth so much more to anyone living it tough there than to you, unless you really want a cheeseburger at the airport or something- it really makes you feel like you're giving back directly to the place you've visited.

Also, giving coins to maids, bellhops or rickshaw drivers is also awesome- it's about a direct impact and connection with your beneficiary.

and yeah "throwing down" may not have been the best way of putting it.
