LPT: Whenever you catch yourself interrupting or talking over someone - stop, apologise for interrupting and ask them to continue. You never know how much that person needs to be heard.

content:
Once you start doing so, you'll realise how important it is to be listened to. For some people, who may be shy or have been mistreated, this is a sign that they are worth hearing and that there is someone who cares what they have to say.

Even if this is not the case, it's a very good habit to get into. It shows manners and consideration of others in the conversation, and often they will be grateful for it as you would be if interrupted too.

Edit: thank you kind strangers for the awards!
Apologies for those who find this too preachy (must admit I do agree reading it back), or think this belongs in a different sub more centred around social interaction.
