title:
YSK that glue traps are cruel and kill much more than target species

content:
Glue traps for mice and other small animals cause cruel suffering and an inhumane death for the animals caught on them. Animals struggle and continue to only get more attached to the glue, and die a slow death of dehydration and intense stress. I once found an old glue trap in a closet at my former workplace that had SIXTEEN dead animals on it including skinks and a tiny ringneck snake. 

Please do not use these traps and discourage others from using them too. Often they are forgotten and the animals caught die in distress. If you find an animal on one of these traps, you can remove it with vegetable oil.
