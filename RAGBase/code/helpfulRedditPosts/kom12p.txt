title:
LPT: If someone is going through a hard time/crisis (death in the family, etc.) don't call and ask, "How can I help?" Instead, suggest some things you are wiling to do: "Can I pick up up some groceries for you/walk your dog for a few days/send over a casserole/babysit your kids?" &lt;more below&gt;

content:
I'll add that if you are a family member, or very close friend you can obviously just ASK. But if you're not, it can be hard for the grieving person to know what, exactly, you're willing to do, so let them know the sorts of things you can do.

This lets the suffering person understand the ways you're willing to help, and gives them some prompts on what they need.
