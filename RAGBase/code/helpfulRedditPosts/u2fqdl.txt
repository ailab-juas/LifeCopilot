LPT: take videos of your parents as they age. even better take videos of them having conversations and being themselves.

content:
if they ever get dementia or any memory related illness/condition it will remind you of who they were. 

my mom has dementia and i took a ton of photos of her and my dad but wish i had taken more videos talking with her.  at times i canâ€™t remember who she was before dementia and it breaks my heart.
