LPT: If you buy delivery flowers, here's a good way to do it.

Tip: Next time you need flowers for someone, follow these steps and you will have a good time.

1. Decide on the budget for flowers
2. Google florist in town you are delivering to
3. Call florist and ask for a delivery for a certain date
4. Tell them the reason you are giving the flowers. ie. Mother's birthday, sister's graduation, grandmother in hospital, stalking target promotion.
5. Tell them you would like "Designer's choice!" for your decided budget. This is a good time to mention things like "She loves daisies," or "She can't stand babies breath," if you know any of these things.


They will make you something way more beautiful than any pictures you might pick out from the internet.

TL/DR; Let the floral designer design it. They know what is in their cooler.
