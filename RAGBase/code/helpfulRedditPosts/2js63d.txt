LPT: Have elderly family members? Ask if they use AOL, they may still be paying monthly for something they never use.

content:
AOL doesn't charge a subscription for the e-mail service, only "internet protection insurance" and their desktop application from what I've seen. They can still access their e-mail through their web browser for free. They charge over $10 a month for their "services" like dial-up, which nobody uses in this day and age. If your family members only use AOL for their e-mail address, they can cancel their subscription and still use it just fine

Last month I found out my pops was paying for AOL every month. (Around $11.99 + $4.99), for something he hasn't used in over a decade. He had spent a total nearing $2,500 since he uses AOL mail, but not the desktop application.  He was paying for something he never used for the past 12 years.
