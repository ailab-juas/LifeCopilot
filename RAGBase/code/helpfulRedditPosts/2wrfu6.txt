LPT: Wake up at the same time every day of the week to avoid being groggy in the morning and tired in the day

content:
I have had diagnosed insomnia for 15 something years. It is primarily anxiety related and I took medication for a long time to help with this. I got tired of constantly taking pills to help me sleep so I started doing research on the web and in my own life to help crack the code.

The number one most important thing to train your body to sleep is to start your day at the same time every day, for me that is 6:30 every day. Trying to "catch up" on sleep on the weekends can completely wreck your natural cycles can kill your productivity when the week starts back.

One thing I learned is that the body naturally uses about 90 minute sleep cycles. If you wake up in the middle of one of these cycles you will be extremely tired when you wake up. So start with when you are waking up and count back in 90 minute segments to determine when to go to sleep. For me I aim for being in bed by 10:30 every night, read for 15 minutes or so, lights out by 10:45ish and asleep by 11 so 5 sleep cycles. 

Watch electronics before bed. Your bed should only be used for sleep and sex. Don't watch tv in bed unless you are sick. No phones or tablets starting an hour before bedtime. The white light from the device throws off your circadian rhythm. Read a book or use an e-reader that isn't backlit.

No caffeine 6 hours before bed. Usually takes 6 hours to get caffeine out of your system so be careful. Even if you think it doesn't bother you, it does. 

A little alcohol, one or two servings, is ok but any more than that will acutally make you lose sleep quality.

This isn't 100% fool proof. There are nights when I can't get to sleep so I have tips for those nights too. Sleepy time tea is amazing and really works, same for chamomile tea. Taking a luke warm bath is great too, you want the bath temp as close to 98.6 as possible. Keep your room on the cool side, use a fan. When you can't get something off your mind, write down what is bothering you and that will help get your mind off of it. Start with a really big number in your head and count backwards by 3's, this will force your mind to think about something other than what is bothering you. Replay a scene from a movie in your head. Try to relax every muscle starting with your toes and working your way up. One those nights when nothing works get up go to a different room and try to read for a bit or watch a little TV and try to go back through your bedtime routine.

Following all these tips I was able to get off my sleep medicine for 4+ years. Had to get back on it for a but because we had a baby and we had no routine for a while, Im back off it now and have been for several months. The change in your habbits isn't going to happen in a week, but like weight training it takes dedication and several weeks to see it paying off.

Edit: this obviously won't work if you have irregular hours for work. My work hours sometimes dictate that I have to wake up earlier than usual but they are regular for the most part.

Also for those asking about social life, I am stay on schedule and change when I go to bed if I want to party some. I just calculate when I need to go to bed next to have a full cycle then wake up at 6:30 like usual. These days i will take a short afternoon nap to help catch back up some and still maintain my circadian rhythm over all. It has to be something you make a priority though, and with my insomnia it isn't worth it to mess it up too bad.

Edit 2: per my instructions I am going start winding down an get off my devices. Never expected this to get on the front page, thanks for that. Happy sleeping to all those non shift workers.
