LPT If you're planning of letting your dogs romp about at night, zip tie glow sticks to their collars.

It makes it really easy to spot them at distance. 

EDIT: Apparently I need to clarify. We have a large fenced-in yard. We use the glow sticks to keep them visible when they get to the fence line. Dogs will find a way to escape. With that said, they are never unattended and do not chew on glow sticks.
