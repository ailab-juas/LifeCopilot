YSK that the labor shortage right now can greatly benefit every min wage worker right now.

Why YSK: If you are working for min wage, you are greatly being underpaid. There are so many places that are desperate for employees. They are raising their wages and offering crazy sign on bonuses that they are not offering to their current employees! When new people get hired, ask how much they are making. Employers are desperate to keep their current employees and find new ones. There are tons of jobs available right now that pay over $18 an hour that will train from scratch. Start applying at night and watch them call you! Every job applied for called back and tried to schedule an interview. I gaurentee your boss has a crazy high labor budget right now. Ask them why you haven't gotten a raise when so many places are offering such great incentives to work for them. We as the employees are in control much more now and I hope it stays this way.
Are you a server? Become a Bartender! Or find a place that will start you as one.
Host? Promote to server!
Fast food worker of any kind? Go apply at restaurants! Way better money for similar work BOH and FOH alike! 
Work retail? Switch to sales! If you have to deal with customers BS, and long hours, you might as well get paid way better for it! 

What I'm saying is, take advantage of these horrible companies like they've taken advantage of you. Get your job offers and go to your boss and say, I want a promotion/raise or I'm going to this place where they are offering both. Very few companies care about resumes right now. Go make that money!
