LPT: Arrange to have flowers sent to your Mom on YOUR birthday.

content:
This may sound strange but I learned it from a friend. My mother passed away last year but I was able to send her flowers on my birthday and she loved it so much she called me crying. Think about it; your birthday is a bigger deal for your mom than it is for you. Why not surprise her and show her you love her when it's supposed to be your day. And while you're at it, call your mom right now and see how she's doing and tell her you love her. 

Edit: I just wanted to say it's been great having people share their stories of their parents. Thanks everyone for the love. I didn't mean to offend anyone that doesn't have the same relationship as I did with my mom and I hope this post didn't bring up any bad memories for people.
