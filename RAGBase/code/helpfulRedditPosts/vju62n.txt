Why YSK - With the uncertainty surrounding a woman's right to bodily autonomy, it may be good to just buy some and have in hand like any first aid supply. The brand Plan B is $50 most places. A tough expense when you need it in an emergency. You can also use an FSA or HSA card to purchase it most places. The specific brand I know of is Rugby brand levenogestrel. It is the exact same thing as the brand Plan B pill. You can also buy it direct from the manufacturer.
