YSK that farting all the time and bathroom-trips being an emergency are not normal, you probably are lactose intolerant. 60-70% Of people are.

A lot of people are without even knowing. Globally, around 60-70% of people are lactose intolerant. Where prevalence is highest in people of African and Asian descent. [More info.](https://intermountainhealthcare.org/blogs/topics/live-well/2017/07/lactose-intolerance/)

Realizing this made my life so much easier.  When I had to go, *I had to go.* Now I can hold it for hours. I used to fart constantly, now I hardly ever do. EDIT: I also used to have acne and a cold at least one week out of every month, that has gone away completely after cutting milk.

In any case, go see a doctor. Only they can definitively tell you what to or not to do.

*Edit2: There are some things I apparently need to add, keep getting comments about it:*  
\- I am NOT saying that lactose intolerance is the only cause of these issues. It just is the most common one  
\- I am NOT vegan. This is not "anti animal-product propaganda". wtf  
\- Not every lactose intolerant person suffers the same symptoms. Some hardly experience anything, some can't go to work for a week.
