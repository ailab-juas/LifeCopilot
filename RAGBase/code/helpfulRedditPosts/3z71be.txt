LPT: If you're afraid or fearful of doing/attempting something, imagine that what you're about to attempt has already become successful and you're just putting in the effort in making the perceived success into reality. You gain the right attitude and positive enthusiasm with such mindset.

I had an investor meeting with a well known investment firm at the beginning of December and I was nervous as hell - So nervous I almost wanted to cancel the pitch.


The previous night before, I just visualised in my mind that the pitch would go very well - That everyone one in the room is just another human being and they all wanted me to succeed. 


I attended the meeting and pitched the idea like I had nothing to lose - there was not a slight being of nervousness within me. That was the first time I know positive visualisation does work.


As for whether I would get the investment I sought, I would find out in a couple of weeks (Christmas breaks given for the long delay). Even I don't get the investment - The idea that I could change my state of mind with just seeing the positive outcome is enough for me to know that the idea does work.
