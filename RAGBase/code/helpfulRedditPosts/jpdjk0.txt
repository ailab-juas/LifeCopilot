YSK: Your friends and family would rather spend their time listening to your problems than having to go to your funeral.

Why YSK: Please stay on this Earth. Even if you may not see it, there are so many people who care for you and would love to help if you have any problems. Do not be afraid to seek help; it can come in different forms like therapy, national suicide help lines or simply expressing your feelings and thoughts to another human being.

Here is a link to a website with a lot of national suicide hotlines: [Buddy Project]( http://www.buddy-project.org/hotlines)
