LPT: Put a little baby oil (the Vitamin E kind is a plus) on limbs/body 2 minutes before getting out of the shower. The smell will rinse away but the moisture won't. You will be soft as shit ALL day, never needing lotion again. And yes your girlfriend/boyfriend will notice.

I've been doing this for a few years and now all my friends are on board. Lotion is expensive as shit these days, don't waste your $$. You'll thank me for this tip during a harsh winter.
