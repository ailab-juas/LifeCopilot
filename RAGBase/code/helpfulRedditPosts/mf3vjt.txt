Why YSK: To help stop a friend’s depression becoming even worse.

If you have a friend who may be depressed, it’s natural for them to ignore texts and cancel plans. The golden rule is to never take it personally. Keep on trying. It’s no time to lose friends. Getting angry or thinking ‘well fuck them if they’re not making an effort’, is only helping the depression win. They’re not pushing you away, their depression is.
