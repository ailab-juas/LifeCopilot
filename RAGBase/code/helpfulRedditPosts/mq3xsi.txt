title:
LPT. Have a dog? Get them blue tennis balls.

content:
As most of us know, dogs aren't technically colorblind but instead have limited color spectrum. While yellows and oranges can actually blend in to the grass, blue pops against the landscape. Your dog will have more fun and lose them in the grass and dirt less often, saving you from having to run around to collect them.


Edit: as others have said, real tennis balls are bad for your dog. Make sure they're dog tennis balls.
