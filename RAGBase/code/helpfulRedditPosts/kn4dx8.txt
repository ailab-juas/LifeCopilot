title:
YSK when buying someone a Christmas gift, unless you know they drink alcohol, don’t buy them alcohol.

content:
Why YSK: I made this mistake this year. I bought the handyman that works in my apartment building a bottle of whiskey for Christmas/New Years. He had to decline because he’s a recovering alcoholic. I baked him cookies instead, but now I have a bottle of whiskey I won’t drink. Happy holidays everyone!

EDIT: This applies to any gift really. Not just Christmas.
