title:
YSK (especially as the days get shorter in winter) that if you only have your Daytime Running Lights on, then nobody can see you from behind because your taillights are off. Make sure the lights you see ahead of your car are actually your full headlights!

content:
I drive a tractor-trailer for a living &amp; it can be very hard to see a car without its headlights on until I'm practically on top of them, which with a large, heavy vehicle like mine can mean trouble. The DRLs are too dim to see from far away - particularly when there are other cars nearby with their own lights. I'll never understand why DRLs don't light the taillights as well.

You also may unknowingly be straining to see ahead of you because DRLs are a dimmer version of your headlights. I'm given to understand that too much of this can damage your eyes.

If someone turns their own car's lights on and off near you, they may be trying to tell you to check that your headlights are on. Please check for everyone's safety.
