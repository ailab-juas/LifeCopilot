title:
LPT When interviewing for a new job, don’t be afraid to ask them hard questions that are important to you. You should be interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you. This will also leave a good impression on any good employer

content:
Always ask questions about things that you are concerned about. It also shows the potential employer that you are curious, thoughtful, and have intent behind your decisions. 
Ideally we all want to be working somewhere for a long time, and want to enjoy what we are doing! The more questions you ask, the less surprises you’ll have after making the transition and ultimately, the more successful you’ll be in your new job/career!
