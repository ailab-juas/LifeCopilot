LPT If you complain to your coworkers or boss that you are experiencing a toxic work culture only to be met with the phrase "that's not something that can change, it's like that everywhere in this industry", it is time to start looking for a new company

I have kept this "rule" for a while and it hasn't really done me wrong. I find this is a poor attempt at employee retention without any attempt at change. It feels like managers are trying to gaslight and instill a sense of hopelessness/complacency in their employees. I have also noticed this being said to younger less experienced employees as well likely taking advantage of them. 

I want to note that this pertains to employee-employee interactions. There really are shitty parts inherent to every job, but toxic people don't have to be a part of it.
