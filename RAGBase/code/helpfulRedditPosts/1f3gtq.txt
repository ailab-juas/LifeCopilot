title:
YSK that when taking a greyhound bus across the USA you can spontaneously stay as long as you like at any of the bus transfer points and it doesn't increase the amount you pay to greyhound

content:
What I mean is that the bus ticket is good for a whole year and so you don't have to catch a specific bus that leaves at a certain time, like you have to with airplanes. So if you travel across country there would be like half a dozen different bus transfer points and you can stay at any of these points for as long as you feel like.

 Also greyhound, as opposed to rip-off artists like Delta and American Airline don't charge you anything for taking a bicycle with you. Those two airlines charge you $150 each way for taking a bicycle.
