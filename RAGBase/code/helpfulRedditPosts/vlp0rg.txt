How to get a raise, one way or another.

1. Tell them you need a raise. Don't tell them it's because X makes more than you. Tell them you want a raise because you think you deserve it. Articulate WHY you think you deserve it.
2. IF they don't give you the raise, start interviewing.
3. WHEN you get a new offer, tell them you're leaving and tell them why.
4. IF they try to match the pay, tell them you want $1 over because you'll have to break your word to the people who gave you the offer. (just an example, and you don't need to stick to this one if you like your current gig, take the match).  **EDIT**: a lot of people commenting on this point.  This only applies if you want to keep the gig.  If you don't, don't even bother with a counter.  Also, the dollar is an example for the young people who this post is meant to help, I understand that to some of you an extra 2k a year is nothing, but to some it's a better quality of life.  It's entirely scalable for your industry/experience level/current pay.

If they don't match the offer, take it in stride, do your two weeks, and move on. If you don't get any other offers, grin and bear it until you do. If you never get any other offers, you're in the wrong place or you are the problem.
