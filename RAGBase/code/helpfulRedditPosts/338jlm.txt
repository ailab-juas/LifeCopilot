LPT: Set yourself a target of 2 "development days" per week to stop yourself stagnating/doing things that need doing.

You can use this in a variety of ways, for instance i'm in the process of changing careers from an IT Technician to a Football (soccer for you Americans) coach. So I've set myself a target of 2 development days per week (starting on Mondays).  

For these development days, after i've finished work I either analyse a football match (complete with notes, so i'm not just watching TV), read a book about football, watch a seminar on football, write an article on football etc  
  
If you're happy with your career and don't need to do this, instead make your development day something that you need to do but would normally put off (tidying up, laundry, reading a book) in favour of playing games or watching TV. It's really helped me since i've started doing this, i've now developed myself a clear plan, with plenty to back it up. Give it a try and see how much extra you get done!
