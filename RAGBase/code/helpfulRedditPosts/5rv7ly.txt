LPT Try to not let it be known that you collect something that's easy for people to obtain. Otherwise for every birthday or Christmas or even just randomly, that thing may be the only type of gift you will receive for the rest of your life.

Your friends and family will mean well, but it could definitely end up being too much of a good thing. Coming up with gift ideas can be hard. So people will default to what they know you "like."

A friend of my mom's liked clowns and had a small collection of knick knacks. Creepy, I know. Well, for 40 years all she got was clown crap. Constantly. Nobody got her anything that was something _other_ than a clown. 

Or, when my wife was young, she liked shopping bags from high end retailers. Who knows why. Before long, she had massive amounts of them. Boxes and boxes of these pointless bags. Friends and family who lived in other parts of the country would send them to her. She got hundreds of them. Eventually, her enthusiasm started to wane. But the bags kept coming. It took a real effort on her part to get people to stop giving them to her. 

Not to mention you will end up with multiples of the same gift often.
