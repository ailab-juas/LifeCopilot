title:
YSK That piercing guns are the worst thing to get pierced with

content:
Why ysk this is because piercing guns are basically like paper hole punchers for your body. It uses blunt force to Pierce through. Since it uses blunt force, you have a massively higher risk of inflammation and infection. You also are at higher risk of the piercing being rejected. The piercing gun can easily get jammed and is very difficult to unjam especially without causing more trauma to the tissue and skin. Please just spare yourself, your friends, your family, you kids, whoever, the extra pain and trouble and get it done professionally with an actual needle. Stores should not even be allowed to do this but they can so itâ€™s up to you to protect yourself and others. There is no guarantee the gun and rings are properly sanitized at these stores and depending on where the piercing is, the infection can easily reach your blood stream.
