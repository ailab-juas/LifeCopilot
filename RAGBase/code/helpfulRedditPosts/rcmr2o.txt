LPT: it's often difficult to shop for adults, because they make their own money and generally buy the stuff they need when they need it. To get around this, give experiences, not objects.

For instance, if you have a friend who's really into baseball, take them to a baseball game. A foodie friend? Take them to a nice restaurant. A friend who loves hiking? Take them on a hike, and pay for any day-of expenses like gas and tolls.

The gift of your time is a thing they can't buy in stores, and it will be a treasured memory. Obviously some people prefer physical gifts so your mileage may vary.
