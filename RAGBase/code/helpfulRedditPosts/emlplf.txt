title:
YSK people with social anxiety are often misidentified as being a jerk.

content:
That person in your office who rarely initiates conversations, only speaks up when there is a problem, keeps to themselves at social gatherings, etc... Often amplified with a case of resting bitch face or resting dick face, they don’t hate you, they don’t think they are better than you, they have been afraid or uncomfortable approaching or talking to people their entire life. Many are never diagnosed or if they are not until late into their adult life.  It’s so frustrating people assuming the worst about you when it is not at all who you are.
