title:
LPT: Reading more books will substantially enhance your conversation skills

content:
I used to hate reading. Never read outside of required school reading. Books became easier to enjoy when I was lucky to come across topics I liked, and now I read a lot. An unintended benefit was that my conversation skills improved miraculously. It became much easier to talk to new people. Books gave me many experiences which I never got to do in real life. It's so much easier to jump in on conversation topics whereas before, it was rare for me to have input. I was also surprised to learn how many people read, but don't talk about it or feel they don't have anyone to talk to about it. I found out reading is like a lowest common denominator like sports, but for people who don't watch sports.
