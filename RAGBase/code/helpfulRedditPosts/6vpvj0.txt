YSK: You can download the entirety of wikipedia, and store it on a USB drive

content:
Wikipedia constantly dumps the database for their entire website. You can go to the link to find the right one for you.

The recommended one is described as "approximately 14 GB compressed, 58 GB uncompressed".
Use this in case your internet goes out and you gotta do research/kill time!
