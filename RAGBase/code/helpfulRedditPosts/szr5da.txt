LPT: Most truck stops in America have all basic needs for survival 24/7, holidays included

content:

To start, if anyone here is homeless and needs a shower, try checking out a truck stop if one is nearby.  We get ‘shower credits’ when we fuel and don’t mind sharing them.  I have 27 right now at Pilot/Flying J.  I don’t expect to use more than 10 of those until they expire and will gladly share them if someone is in need of a shower

Truck driver here who more or less lives out of truck stops.. I know on holidays, emergencies, late night munchies, etc., you wish there was a place you could get anything you *needed* at anytime.  Showers are available for 10-15 dollars a pop.  A mediocre, but doable supply of groceries.  Baby wipes, shampoo, phone chargers, basic tools, OTC medicine, beer,  clothes, etc. are almost always available.  

They do price gouge a little, but it’s not bad if you’re needing something in a hurry.  Your plumbing went out and you really need a shower before they can fix it 3 days from now?  Consider driving to a truck stop.  Work second shift and need some basic groceries at 2am?  Grab your peanut butter, gallon of milk, and full sized toothpaste at a truck stop.
