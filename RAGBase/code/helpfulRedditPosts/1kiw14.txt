You should know when a verb turns into a noun, for example the difference between "set up" and "setup".

content:
English has this thing called "phrasal verbs" (verbs are "doing words") where one or more words are added to a verb to make a different meaning. You can *call* your mother, but you can also *call for* your mother and *call on* your mother, or even *call out to* your mother. You can *send* your assistant somewhere, but also *send for* your assistant, which is essentially the opposite. 

That's all well and good, but people frequently get something wrongâ€”when one of those verbs changes into a noun. 

A common example is "set up". We all know what it means to *set up* a new computer. That's the verb, made up of two words:

* I set up my computer
* she sets up her computer
* we were setting up our computer
* your computer has been set up

So what's "setup" or "set-up"?

Those are *nouns*, or naming words. A setup is a *thing* (an abstract noun). It's the noun that means "the process or activity of setting up something". 

It is **never** correct to write "I setup my computer", any more than it would be correct to write "I fixedup my computer". 

It is however correct to write:

* I  did the setup of my computer
* she did the setup of her computer
* we were working on the setup of our computer
* we have completed the setup of your computer

And also to write things like "here are the setup details for your computer", because again, it's not a verb. It's like "here are the monitor details for your computer".
