title:
LPT: recently, some automated customer service phone lines won’t let you speak to a person and insist you talk to the machine like a person instead. If you say nonsense words like “meep morp blerf norb” over and over it registers as you needing to talk to a person, and transfers you.

I was in an infinite loop on a certain Bezos related help line, asking to speak to a representative numerous times and having the automation insist I ask it my questions as If it was a person, which I did, and it was unhelpful- the only way I figured out how to get a person on the line was to make robot noises with my mouth.
