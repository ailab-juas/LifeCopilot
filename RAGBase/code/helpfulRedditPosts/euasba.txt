LPT: The new movie "Dolittle" has a sugar glider character, which might encourage some children to want sugar gliders as pets. If you know someone considering this, make sure they do lots of research first, gliders are extremely difficult.

content:
Sugar gliders are very cute but also extremely high maintenance. They can live 10-15 years if taken care of correctly. Many people treat them like hamsters and they live only a couple years, which is why they are illegal in some places. Their health and diet need to be constantly monitored with daily fresh food, they require a lot of attention and a lot of space. If you get a single one instead of a pair their loneliness will heavily impact their health. They are also nocturnal and stay up all night screaming. I love mine, but when people ask me if they should get some I always tell them NO. Not unless you want a huge 10-15 year commitment. 

There are disgusting companies that sell them as "Pocket Pets," advertising them as good gifts for small children that can survive on a diet of pellets. Do not trust anything that uses the phrase "Pocket Pets" or "sugar bears" (related). If you or someone you know is even thinking about getting a sugar glider do not do it casually, do as much reading as you can first. 

EDIT: I'm getting a lot of joke comments that it doesn't matter because nobody is going to see Dolittle. Yes, I understand that you and your adult friends think it looks bad. Small children, historically, do not check the Rotten Tomatoes score before deciding whether to go see a movie with cute animals who talk funny. The box office right now is around $90 million dollars, even if it ultimately loses money because it sucks a lot of kids are still clearly going to see it.
