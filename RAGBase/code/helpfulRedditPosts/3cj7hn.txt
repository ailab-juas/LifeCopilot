LPT: When a friend tells you they've decided to go to therapy, congratulate them :)

content:
It's a big and scary step for them, and it probably took them some time to decide to do it. Depending on where they live, therapy might still be to some extent frowned upon. If they're telling you, they probably need some form of support and encouragement. 

[EDIT] I don't mean you should specifically use the word "congratulations". I used the verb ["to congratulate"](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/congratulate). You are all free to use any congratulatory words you want to, just pick ones that show encouragement and support. If you want to. Y'all got free will and shit. 

P.S. I'm saying you might wanna consider congratulating (again, a verb) instead of a "meh" reaction, a disinterested reaction or a negative reaction. If you encourage therapy, you might end up helping somebody. And helping is nice. 

That's all.

[EDIT2] English isn't my first language, I did not expect a grammar issue to cause such an uproar.
