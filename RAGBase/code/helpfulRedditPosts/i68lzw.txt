YSK that asking for time off isn't a crime and you shouldn't feel bad EVER for taking time off that YOU EARNED. You don't owe your job anything.

My wife works at a law firm and is always worried or scared that she's going to get in trouble for taking time off.

The crazy thing is that she has earned the time off so it shouldn't be a problem, however she feels that her boss and coworkers will be mad at her if she does.

Honestly America needs to lose this work is all you're good for mentality.
