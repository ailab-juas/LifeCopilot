LPT: ‪When you can’t find your glasses. Grab your phone, open up the camera and use that to see. Everything will be in focus on your screen and you can hold it close enough that you’ll be able to see everything clearly. ‬

I’d say two or three times a week I misplace my glasses somewhere in my room (but I always know where my phone is because, like you, I’m addicted to it). So when I can’t see, I grab my phone, open up the camera app and use that as a quick way to bring everything in focus. Works like a charm.
