LPT: Get fuller, more informative/honest/emotionally open answers from people by simply remaining silent after their first response.

content:
This sounds a bit weird but it's a common practice during police questioning and therapy. By simply giving people the impression that you were expecting them to continue speaking, even if in their head they've said everything they meant to say, you put them "on the spot" in a sense, and instinctively they'll find themselves grasping something from one layer "deeper" down the trail of thought they had begun (and as a result, closer to their inner monologue if that makes sense).

In police questioning it can be from a play on fear or a will to appease, and in normal situations it plays off of lesser versions of that (wanting to keep the flow going/genuinely believing that the answer was insufficient or you were expecting more). 

I know this sounds a bit like psycho advice, that'll make YOU look like a psycho, but so long as you don't just stand there blankly like a robot, and actually signal interest with body language and facial expressions (basically just be a normal person in a conversation who just gave things a chance to sink in) you'd be surprised what comes out.

Bonus note on a personal level: especially when arguing in a relationship, you'd be surprised how much it speeds up your journey to the "crux of the matter".
