LPT: At a funeral or wake, don't say "I didn't know [deceased] had a [daughter/sister/other close relative]", say, "It's good to meet you" or "I'm sorry for your loss."

This happened to me many years ago but I was reminded of it by something else. At my father's funeral, a lot of people said they didn't know he had a daughter. Not terribly surprising; we were adults and he had moved to a different city, I was from his first marriage, and he wasn't terribly sociable so their social life revolved around his second wife, who didn't know me well. But it was still very invalidating and hurtful in that situation. The people saying it were innocent, but don't do this, folks - if you're the fifth person to say it, it sounds very much like "You weren't a very important person in their lives, they didn't even tell us about you."

*Edit:* Really surprised how controversial this has been. To me it seemed like a fit for LPT because (1) many people do say it at funerals (as shown by replies here), (2) many people do find it unintentionally hurtful (also shown by replies), (3) I assume most people do not go to funerals intending to be hurtful to family of the deceased, and (4) it's well known that people don't know what to say at a funeral so having a canned phrase at the ready as a substitute is useful, even if it isn't the best phrase ever, because that makes it less likely that you'll flounder and use the hurtful one. Plenty of commenters have given better options than "Sorry for your loss;" just choose something inoffensive and have it up your sleeve when you need it.
