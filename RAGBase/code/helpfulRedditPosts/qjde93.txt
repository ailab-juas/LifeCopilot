LPT: greeting a dog for the first time

content:
When you meet a dog for the first time DON'T squat down and look them in the eye. This is a challenge. Also DON'T bend over or reach your hand over the back of their neck to pet them, it's the one spot they can't protect.

DO stand a little bit sideways and hold your hand a little out from your side, palm down with the fingers loosely closed in a fist for them to approach to sniff you if they want. Once they sniff and approve of you go ahead and reached your hand palm up UNDER their chin for a scratch, if you are both comfortable, you can go up the side of their head to scratch their ears. If they pull away let them go. Not all dogs want strangers to touch them.

This tip applies the most with bigger dogs but is still applicable with all dogs. I have a BIG dog and when this advice is followed the meeting is a total success, when the humans don't follow these basic tips my dog is clearly uncomfortable and will even woof out of anxiety and distrust.

Editing to add: first ask their human if you can meet their dog.
