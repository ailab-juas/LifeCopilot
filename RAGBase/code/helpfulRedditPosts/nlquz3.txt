YSK that you can BLUR your house out from Google Street View.

Why YSK: It's nice to not have the entire world easily see what your house looks like with a simple Google search and click.

Delivered something to a house today and when I arrived Google maps showed it as Blurred out on the GPS app. Only one on the street. Never seen anything like it. Anyways, I did some research and here's how you do it:.

Go to Google Maps and enter your home address.

Enter into Street View mode by dragging the small yellow human-shaped icon, found in the bottom-right corner of the screen, onto the map in front of your house.

With your house in view, click "Report a problem" in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

Center the red box on your home, and select "My home" in the "Request blurring" field.
