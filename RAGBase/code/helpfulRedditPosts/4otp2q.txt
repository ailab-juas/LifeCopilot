LPT: Think of your friends and family who've lost their fathers too early. Checking in on them today may help them with their grief.

content:
Fam, to all of those who've lost their dads too early, I am truly sorry. My heart is with you today. 

EDIT: I want to thank each and every one of you for the overwhelming love and support in this thread. It's a shitty club to be a part of but we've got to stick together and talk through our shit sometimes. 

Talking to each of you really helped me when I was in a really dark place yesterday, and I am sincerely grateful for everyone who stopped by. 

Last thing, if you or anyone you know is suffering from depression or other mental illnesses and is at risk for suicide, please seek help now.
