YSK that the left lane is for passing, not cruising. [US]

content:
You should know that if there is a long line of cars behind you, and you are not passing anyone, you should merge into the right lane. Repeat if necessary. 

Your awareness can go a long way towards preventing extra traffic. 

Thank you from a fellow commuter!


Edit: This applies to driving on the interstate and highways, but if you have a long line behind you on any road....MOVE!
