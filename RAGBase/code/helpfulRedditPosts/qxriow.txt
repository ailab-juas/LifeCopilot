YSK: Those money markers only check the kind of paper a bill is printed on

That other YSK about counterfeit currency made me think of this.

YSK that those money marker pens you can get anywhere are ONLY checking the kind of paper the bill is printed on. 

Why YSK: One common method of counterfeiting money is called 'washing'. They remove the ink from a low denomination bill then print a high denomination bill on top of that. If you are just using the money marker to check, it wont detect this because it's still the right kind of 'paper'.

Also, YSK [how to determine if a bill is counterfeit](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/how-to-detect-counterfeit-money/) aside from using the pen.
