LPT: Beware of apps that help you to monitor your health oriented data because the company may be totally free to sell your data to insurance companies.

content:
Phone apps that help you to monitor your personal health oriented data (such as diet, blood sugar, blood pressure, sleep, exercise, etc) may not qualify as a “covered entity” under HIPAA and if so are totally free to sell your data to health insurance companies.

In fact, this is probably the core of their revenue stream.
