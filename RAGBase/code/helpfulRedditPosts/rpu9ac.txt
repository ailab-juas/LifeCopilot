LPT: When You are Done Drinking Alcohol For the Night, Start Drinking Lots of Water

content:
The major reason for nausea and hang-over effects from drinking is dehydration.  The body requires a lot of water to flush the toxins from your system.  After you're done drinking alcohol, if you start drinking plenty of water (even though you probably won't feel like it), it will greatly mitigate the negative effects from over indulgence.
