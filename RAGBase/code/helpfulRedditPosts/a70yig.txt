LPT: want a day off from work? Don't ask for a day off, tell your boss that you NEED the day off.

content:
I've always asked, hey if it's alright, can I take tomorrow off, or whatever day? Then my boss would always be like, well we'll see what tomorrow looks like and if we can get someone to cover for you. Today I told him, I need tomorrow off, didn't explain, didn't ask and he just said okay, no questions asked. Obviously this depends on your job and all that but yeah.
