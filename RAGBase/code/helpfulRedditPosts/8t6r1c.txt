LPT: If you have to give your cat a bath for any reason, wrap them in a towel before lowering them into the water.

My fiance and I have to bathe our kitten because she has ringworm. The first bath went about as well as you'd expect and we have several battle scars to prove it. 

The second time, she knew what was up and absolutely *refused* to go in the water, clinging to our skin for dear life. We had the idea to wrap her up in a small towel and keep her there while we gave her the bath so her claws wouldn't scratch us. So we filled the sink with warm water and while she was purrito'd we put her in the sink and she didn't struggle at ALL even once her front paws were free. No meowing no clawing no nothing. She was as chill as could be and we washed all of her with no struggle. She even calmly walked to the warm dry towel we had to dry her with instead of scrambling across the counter in a panic.

Wouldn't ever give a cat a bath unless necessary but this saved us so much blood and tears.
