LPT: Supermarket flowers cost a fraction of the big websites, look great, and are ALWAYS appreciated

content:
I always try to pick up a bouquet for my SO every time I go to the supermarket. For example, a bunch of lilies costs $4.99 at Trader Joe's and is certainly easy brownie points. Don't wait until a special occasion to pick up flowers for the ones you love when you can do it so easily any day of the week just because.
