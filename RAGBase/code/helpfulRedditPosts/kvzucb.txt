LPT: Straight A's aren't as important as your resume.

content:
The thing I wish I'd been told in college, that I've realized from experience, is that the grades themselves don't matter much. If joining that extra club or taking that extra internship means accepting a couple B's or even C's when you could've gotten A's, it may be a worthwhile tradeoff. Your goal is to get the career that will get you where you need to go, not to have extra tassels at graduation. A job may ask you for your GPA (maybe) but it wont ask you if you got an A in that required english 101 class

Please note that if you're going for an advanced degree this advice may not apply to you.

Edit: sweet jesus this is my biggest post ever.

couple quick things. if youre going back to school this almost certainly doesnt apply to you. if youre in certain forms of engineering or accounting, comments indicate this does not apply to you. if youre in any major that could even remotely be described as humanities, the job markets gonna fuck you hard if you assume grades will get you through alone. thanks for the awards, night all
