LPT: Be cautious when taking advice from people with minimal life experience.

content:
There is a certain age range (teens to late 20’s for most of us, later for some) when self confidence out paces knowledge and experience. We feel compelled to give life advice to others based on confidence or high extroversion, but this advice can be meaningless at best and destructive at worst due to the person’s lack of practical life experience. Social media influencers are a perfect example of people who spew their misinformed opinions and naive advice from a megaphone, not realizing how impractical or harmful it is.

EDIT: I think asking ourselves "How are they qualified to give this advice?" can go a long way.
