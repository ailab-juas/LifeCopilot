LPT: When Santa drops of presents, have him write your children letters on their successes for the year and why they made the “nice” list

content:
Every year since my oldest sibling was a baby, Santa would leave a letter next to the empty milk and cookies. The letter would contain praises for the year and contain advice for the next year (or if we were particularly naughty, reminders to be good lol). 

We’re all adults now, and our parents continued this even past the age of us believing in Santa. It became a tradition on Christmas morning to read the letter, and essentially hear our parents tell us how proud they were of us. And when we set up the tree and decorate in early December, I always stop to read the letters, and it’s so amazing to see the growth, reading things I don’t remember, the introduction of my younger sibling into the letters, and Santa evolving from “you did so good playing with the other kids” to ”wow it’s amazing how you got into this rigorous program in school” to “I can’t believe you’re leaving for college”

The recognition and love these letters brought are something I’ll never forget and if your kids are young enough and you decide to start this up too, I guarantee it’s something they’ll look back fondly on too
