YSK many U.S. communities offer a Citizens Police Academy, a safe and simplified version of police training for citizens.

content:
I'm exactly half way through my training and I must say it has been amazing. The program is free in my community (generously subsidized by a local hospital). 

We have learned (or will be learning) about K-9 use and training, use of force laws and situations, a great presentation by our county medical examiner, speed enforcement and traffic stops, and so much more. 

This week we trained on a use of force simulator (the same one featured [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7P6uwkEJNY)). It's much harder than it looks, much more intense and immersive than it looks, and after learning about use of force I have a new perspective of current events in the media involving police shootings. 

My particular community partners with three others as a joint effort for this program and all officers and departments have been welcoming, respectful and knowledgeable. 

My (M/35) class is composed of people of all ages and sexes and has been one of the most rewarding personal things I've ever done. I'm even considering joining the local auxiliary police force (fully uniformed, non-paid, volunteer, unarmed).
