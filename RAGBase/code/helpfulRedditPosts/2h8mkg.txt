LPT: Take pictures of your new apartment BEFORE you move a single box in and post them on FB. If your landlord says you caused damage that you didn't, you have dated and documented proof that it was like that before hand.

People are really taking this whole "using facebook" thing to the max, I love it. Just to clarify I used facebook as the example because I figured many people still used that (unlike me who goes on once every 6 months and has no other connections to media sites like twitter, instagram, etc), email to yourself, save hard copies, whatever you'd like, just protect yourselves in the long run with evidence.

EDIT/UPDATE: Holy hell guys, thanks for all the upvotes I guess :)


FACEBOOK WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF "DOUBLE SAVING" THE PICTURES. &lt; I can't say this enough


And in my neck of the woods, we don't do walk throughs looking for damage, you show up, if you don't like the place you leave, if you like it (or have no other choice) you take it and thats that.


And yes, this is advice for landlords as well. I don't want anyone, regardless of relationship to the property to get ripped off.
