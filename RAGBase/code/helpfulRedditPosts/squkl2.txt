LPT: It doesn't matter how old you are, I'm encouraging you all to have a living will. Leaving your loved ones to make decisions about your end of life wishes is emotionally taxing and selfish. Please do us that favor.

Edit: Thank you all for sharing your stories with us, I appreciate all the great advice given by so many of you.

There seems to be a bit of confusion between 'Wills' and 'Living wills', hopefully this will clear up any confusion. 

A living will details a person’s wishes with regards to their medical care in the event they should become put in a coma or persistent vegetative state, or are incapacitated in some other way that prevents them from communicating their wishes.While the last will and testament details a person’s wishes for their property and assets after their death, a living will details that person’s wishes to doctors while they are still alive — hence the name.

Edit #2: Wow! I did not expect so many responses, it's very overwhelming. If you're reading this, please take the time to look over other posters responses, there's so much valuable advice to be found. 

As hard as it is to have these difficult discussions, please do it...not only for you, but for the ones you'll leave behind. 

I may not be able to respond to each and every post, but I will definitely take the time to read through all of them. 

Thank you all :)
