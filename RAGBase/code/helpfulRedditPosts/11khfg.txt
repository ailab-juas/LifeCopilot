LPT: For an easily clean house, every time you enter a room, put away five things.

content:
It takes ~~absolutely no time~~ **the exact amount of time needed to move five objects** (edit: Sorry, I did not mean to imply that this LPT is capable of altering the fabric of time) and your house stays super clean. If you don't have five things to put away, use a more elaborate cleaning method, like dusting. Dust five things, wash five dishes, throw away five expired food items, etc. You rarely ever have to spend a chunk of free time cleaning thoroughly because your place is perpetually tidy.  

Edit more: LPT #2: If you don't like this tip, *don't use it.* Just blew your mind, right? 

Also, yes Reddit, there is a difference between "clean" and "tidy." That's where that part about dusting, vacuuming, washing dishes, etc. comes in. Did...did you read that part? Or is that not cleaning? Oh God, is that seriously not cleaning?! WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING TO MY HOUSE ALL THESE YEARS?!
