LPT: When you are in an argument, ask yourself if you are hungry, tired, or both

content:
Sorry for the weird title - I didn't know how to explain all this in one sentence.    
    
The worst piece of advice given to couples is 'Never go to bed angry'.    
    
Many arguments occur after 6pm, when we are hungry, tired, or both, and this can cloud our judgement and make us more irritable.    
    
If you and your SO start arguing when you're getting ready for bed -- just go to sleep. You're tired, they're tired, and you need to continue this conversation when you're both in a better state of mind.
