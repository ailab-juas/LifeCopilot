LPT: Be cautious of turning a hobby into a business. Being financially obligated to do anything for a living can really suck the joy out of it.

content:
Hobbies are great in part because you can do them when you feel like it. What’s fun on occasion may not be fun for forty hours a week. Even worse, you may find yourself unable to enjoy the same hobby in your free time, robbing you of a source of entertainment.

That’s not to say it can’t work. Lots of people turn hobbies into jobs and still love it. But before you try it, ask yourself if you would want to cook for yourself after being a chef all day long and see how it sits with you (replace cooking with whatever you enjoy).
