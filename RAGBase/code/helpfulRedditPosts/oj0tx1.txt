YSK: Never plug in a flash drive you don't recognize to a computer you care about. Malicious USB devices can hack or fry your computer.

There exist devices that look like flash drives, but actually **emulate keyboards to hack your computer, or use capacitors to fry your computer.**

**Do not plug in a flash drive you do not recognize into a computer you care about!** Also, if you lose your flash drive for awhile, it might have been converted to a malicious USB. 

I made a meme to demonstrate:

The flash drives that emulate keyboards (known as "Bad USB" or "Rubbery Ducky") come with scripts that covertly open command prompts on your computer and execute scripts. These can cost less than $5, repurposing an original flash drive.. [Here is a short, fictional, educational episode demonstrating  how this works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eriptvQ1BHg)


Flash drives that *fry* your computer are known as "USB killers". They use capacitors to charge up from the USB port, and then send the power back to "tase" your computer. [Here is a short video demonstrating the effect.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hbuhFwFsDU). These can cost from $30 to $100.

If you find a USB device laying around at a place of business or work, give it to your boss or sysadmin. Unknown flash drives should be  investigated on an expendable computer (such as a Raspberry Pi) in a non-networked environment. More advanced Bad USBs can come with a SIM card and cell modem built in, giving it the ability to "phone home" even on a non-networked computer.

Why YSK: This is a very common method for cyberattacks. [The US hacked the Iran nuclear program just by leaving USB drives around](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet), but this attack is effective to target almost anyone.
