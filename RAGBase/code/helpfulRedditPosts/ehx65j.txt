LPT: Put a bucket in your shower to catch the water while the shower heats up.

content:
Living in Australia we are currently under a huge heatwave, a drought and water restrictions. You can get 3/4 of a bucket every shower.

Bonus points for filling up a bird bath, or animal feeder. The animals need the water too

Edit: because like a billion people ask why I would have a hot shower during a heatwave. I wake up in the coldest part of the morning, around 4am to 6am. For everyone else I guess its a comfort thing.

Also thanks for the support guys. Sharing all your tips and stuff is great
