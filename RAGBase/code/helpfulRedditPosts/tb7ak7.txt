YSK If you're active duty military, document any and all medical or health related issues, before you get out; no matter how small or trivial they may seem

Why YSK:

Too  many soon to be vets and retirees, leave the service without even  attempting to do their VA stuff, and years later when they do, due to  some previously minor medical condition that has either gotten worse or  they finally decided to get it done, go through hoops and jumps, just to  get seen by the VA, and then get mediocre results in regards to their  ratings, because they never documented anything while in (usually due to  bravado and peer pressure).

Dont  be that guy or gal. What may seem minor while you were in, could develop  into something far worse just a few years later. Furthermore, you are  owed those medical (and sometimes dental and vision) benefits. Dont  short yourself on what many folks have fought for you to have.
