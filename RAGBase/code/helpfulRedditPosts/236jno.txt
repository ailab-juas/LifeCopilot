LPT: Stinky pits in the middle of the day? Rather than splashing them with water, use hand sanitizer

content:
What you smell is the product of bacteria. Hand sanitizerâ€™s purpose is to kill bacteria. The smell goes away instantly. Works with rubbing alcohol as well, but hand sanitizer is usually more accessible.

Ideally, you'd also have a spare deodorant with you. Put that on *after* you use the hand sanitizer. Otherwise you're just masking the smell, not getting rid of it.
