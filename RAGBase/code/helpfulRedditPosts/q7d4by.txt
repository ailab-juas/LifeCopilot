title:
LPT, your partner doesn't see what you see in the mirror. don't return compliments with something negative about yourself.

content:
We all get older,  we all gain weight,  we all get pimples,  etc etc. Your husband,  wife,  boyfriend,  girlfriend,  whatever,  is not generally looking at that mark on your cheek,  or that bit of weight you've gained. They are most likely looking at that pair of eyes,  or that smile they fell in love with,  that's still there underneath the wear of time.  If you hear them say that your hair looks nice,  or they like the shape of your nose,  don't reply with a negative thing about yourself.  They are choosing to see the positive,  so rock that skirt and boots at 40. Put on that suit that your girl thinks is hot,  grow out that graying beard if she likes it.  Wear that sexy nightgown with no panties on,  because your partner isn't thinking about your flaws, it's just in your mind.  &lt;3
My wife will probably never read this,  but if she creeps on my reddit for some reason. I love you!
