LPT: "Do you know why I pulled you over?" Translates from cop speak as "Are you stupid enough to incriminate yourself for my benefit?"

content:
Never answer this even if it is obvious. At best, you have just admitted guilt. A worse possibility is that you confess something else:

You:  "Because I didn't come to a complete stop / speeding / seatbelt?"

Cop:  "No, your tail light is out. But I'll write that down too."

Reddit, what is the best way to answer a question like this that may diffuse the situation and perhaps send you on your way without a ticket?


Edit:  Did not expect this post to generate so much emotion. For the record, I agree with those who encourage courtesy and politeness in dealing with any situation. 

Edit 2:  In no way am I suggesting lying or dishonesty of any sort in encounters with law enforcement.  I think those who are recommending a polite, humorous response to this question have the right idea.
