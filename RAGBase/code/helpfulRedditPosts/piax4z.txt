LPT: For better vacations, debrief when you get back from vacation! Write down what worked and didn't work, what you packed but didn't need, what you needed but didn't pack, what you wish you did more of, what wasn't worth the hassle. Check your list when planning your next vacation.

**Bonus:** Ask everyone in your family/group to reflect on good memories from the vacation.  This helps them consolidate good memories from the vacation and gets everyone's perspective on what was good/bad!
