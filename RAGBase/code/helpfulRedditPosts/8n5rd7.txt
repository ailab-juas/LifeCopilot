LPT: Don’t forget to donate food this summer! Typically, folks excessively donate in the winter to food banks before or during the holidays, which is great. But in the summer, donations are lowest, so this is when the food bank’s need is greatest.

And remember when donating: would you want to  eat it? Nutrient rich items like canned vegetables, fruit, and tomato sauce or high protein cans of chicken or tuna will do a lot more good for people than empty calories like top ramen or powdered soup mixes.
