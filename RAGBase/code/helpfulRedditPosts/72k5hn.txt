LPT: If you have a friend living in an abusive situation, insist on giving them your spare key. Having immediate access to a safe house can mean all the difference in the world.

content:
Many abusers isolate you and alienate you from your friends and family. They make sure that their abuse can continue uninterrupted, because you now have no-one to turn to and nowhere to go. 

Though I seldom used my friend's spare key, knowing I would always have a place to stay if I needed to breathe, or get away urgently, potentially saved my life many times.
