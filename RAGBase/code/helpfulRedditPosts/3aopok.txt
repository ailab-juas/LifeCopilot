**The Misconceptions :**

_______________________________________________________

&amp;gt;Contrary to the normal popularisation of drowning as a highly visible behavior, involving shouting, abrupt or violent movements such as splashing and waving, and visible difficulty—which is a related phenomenon, known as aquatic distress, which often but not always precedes drowning—the "instinctive drowning response" is noiseless and confined to subtle movements.

**What Actually Happens :**

__________________________________________________________

&amp;gt;As an instinctive reaction, this is not consciously mediated nor under conscious control. They extend their arms laterally and press down on the water’s surface in order to lift their mouths out of the water. When their mouth is above the water, they quickly exhale and inhale instead of calling for help. Because of their arm movements and their focus on lifting their mouth out of the water, they cannot wave, kick their feet, nor swim to a rescuer, nor grasp a rope or other rescue equipment. They may be misunderstood as "playing in the water" by those unfamiliar with drowning, and other swimmers just meters away may not realize that an emergency is occurring. Lifeguards and other persons trained in rescue learn to recognize drowning people by watching for these instinctive actions.

**What Should Be Done In Such Situations :**
______________________________________________________________

&amp;gt; It is advisable to wait for the victim to stop moving or sink before approaching, rescuing, and attempting to resuscitate. While the instinctive reaction to drowning is taking place, victims latch onto any and all solid objects in attempts for air, which can result in the drowning of a would be rescuer as well as the victim.
