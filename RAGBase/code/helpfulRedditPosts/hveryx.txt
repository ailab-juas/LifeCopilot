title:
LPT: No 'Zero Days'

content:
Universally applicable LPT that I actually picked up right here on reddit.

If you are depressed, in a slump, or are just having trouble getting a project done - make sure you have no 'zero' days. In essence, this means that no matter what, every day you do SOMETHING productive towards your ends.

Have to write a paper and keep procrastinating? Open a doc, type the headline, save and close. Tomorrow, maybe you write the first sentence. Next day, maybe you finish a paragraph. As long as you have no zero days, where you get nothing done, every progressive day will find the task a bit easier to manage.
