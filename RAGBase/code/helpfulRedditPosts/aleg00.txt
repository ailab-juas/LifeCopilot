LPT: In very cold weather put your jacket on 5 minutes before leaving - it’s your body heat in the jacket that keeps you warm and it will have time to hold some warmth inside

Forget what your grandma told you about not feeling the benefit

Edit - Warmth advice from all the good comments: 

1. As people keep pointing out - don’t do it until you start sweating, just get warm and head out 

2. Multiple layers are better than one big layer to help you regulate temperature 

3. Mittens are slightly warmer than gloves because your fingers keep each-other warmer when they aren’t separated from each other  

4. Just because it’s cold don’t stop drinking water - lots of people still get dehydrated in the freezing cold

5. When it’s SUPER cold: not taking a shower in the morning can help you have a warmer day (if you can get away with that)
