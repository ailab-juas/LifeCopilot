title:
YSK these things about sunscreen

content:
With weather getting hotter and people going on vacation more you will probably need to use sunscreen at some point, so here are three big tips to remember.

1. You don't need high SPF. In fact the FDA is thinking about banning high SPF because it has health risks. You can do just fine with 50 spf.

2. Avoid the sunscreens with added vitamins as the ingredients to do this can also accelerate skin cancer. 

3. Avoid aerosols, they look like it makes life easier but turns out they lead to thinner coverage.
