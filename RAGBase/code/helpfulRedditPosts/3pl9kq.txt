LPT: Keep a regularly-updated note with your S.O.'s favourite things by category, add to it as much as possible

content:
Any time my girlfriend mentions something that she loves or we share a new consumable she really likes, it goes into an Evernote note.

Each item in the list is grouped by type (alcohol, clothing brand+size, chocolates, etc.), and each item is a link to a Google Image Search so I can easily spot it when shopping.
Let's say I am passing by the wine store on the way home. With one search I can pull up her favourite red wine or prosecco, with a link to what the packaging looks like.

This might come off as cheating a little, but your S.O. appreciates the time and care you take to make sure you remember, not the inhuman ability remember things without electronic help.
