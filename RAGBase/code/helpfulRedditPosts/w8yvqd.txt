LPT: When buying baby clothes for someone that is expecting a child, get clothes for older age groups (3-6 months, 6-9 months), not newborns.

content:
Parents get a ton of newborn-sized clothes already and the baby will probably not get to wear all of them before outgrowing them. I did this for an old boss' baby shower and she was very appreciative of the forward-thinking! I got shoes and shorts for a 6-month-old and some diapers for immediate use.
