[LPT] On Jan. 1st turn all the hangers in your closet with clothes on them backwards. When you re-hang your clothes after wearing/washing them, turn the hangers the proper direction. On Jan. 1st of the following year, donate all the clothes that haven't been turned to charity.

This trick works for students with a 1 year lease as well.  Somebody could be wearing those unused clothes!

EDIT: I get it, leave out the coats if you want.  No need for the hateful messages.
