YSK, It’s rude to arrive at parties earlier than you’re supposed to, without advance permission

content:
YSK, similarly to when people are late for parties, arriving *too* early can also be just as rude.. 

**Why YSK:** People may still be setting up and doing last minute things to prep for the party, and when you arrive early without notice, people may feel the need to ‘make you feel welcome’ and host you rather than finish up their setting up. It throws everything off sometimes.

We had a birthday party for my daughter last weekend, and she had friends arrive over 45 minutes early unexpectedly. I ended up having to take her friends with me to the store to grab some last minute things just so my daughter could get out of the shower and get dressed. It was frustrating to say the least..

Unless previously agreed upon, stick to making it to the party as close to the time it starts so as not to cause unnecessary stress and confusion.. of course if you’re there to help set up, that’s a different situation entirely!
