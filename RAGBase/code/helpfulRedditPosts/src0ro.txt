LPT: Stop looking for "the one", that's a made-up concept to sell romantic novels &amp; movies. A real relationship needs work, commitment, compromise, understanding &amp; willingness to have a two-way trade on every level &amp; meet you halfway.

content:
Always remember that every successful relationship needs to be a two-way trade; you give something you receive something in return, otherwise one side will finally get tired &amp; the whole thing collapses. It doesn't need to be the same thing or on the same level but there needs to be some balance.

Update: this really blew up, thanks for all the upvotes &amp; awards; btw, happy Valentine's day. Don't listen to anybody who tells you fantasies do come true without any effort, they might but usually last as long as a dream too.
Life is full of challenges &amp; tests us every single day, you can either have/be a true partner to climb to the peak together or wait for the prince/princess charming to come &amp; make your life a Disney movie.

Update 2: If your relationship needs no work, that's amazing, good on you, you have done the work! The safe place you created together &amp; the trust despite life's ups &amp; downs did not fall from the sky. The two of you did it together, now it's just like a well-choreographed dance.
