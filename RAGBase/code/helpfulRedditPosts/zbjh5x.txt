YSK You can buy items to make/enhance your own personal care products

WHY YSK: It's often cheaper and gives you control over ingredients. Keep in mind that for the everyday person like myself, I'm talking about basic items like shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, styling products, etc.

There are probably many sites but I live in the USA and have only used Making Cosmetics. While I haven't made my own whole products, I have bought items to replace expensive products. The first thing I bought about 5 years ago was a product to replace a pricey "wrinkle blurring" item I'd been using for a while. The name-brand item cost me around $15 for a 7-oz tube. I was able to buy a 15-oz jar of the powder (which lasted me over a year) for about $10 at the time.

Because I don't know anything about (or have the equipment) for complex formulation of products, I stick with the basics. I buy hair conditioner bases, curl cream bases, skin care oils (to add to existing products), and other simple-to-use additives, and use my home blenders and basic tools to mix things. The last thing I bought was some hydrolyzed silk protein that I add to my hair and skin moisturizers. I also sometimes buy fragrances and flavors to add to existing products.

The thing is, you have to use common sense or do your own research. I'm just a consumer with zero experience in product development. If you want to get serious, you can contact M.C. for help with any formulation. They sell containers and applicators, etc. If you are so inclined, you could create your own line of products. The site has resources and will assist you (for a price).

I hope this might help some of you save some money or maybe get creative.
