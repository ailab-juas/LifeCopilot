LPT: How to shot vodka like a Russian? Breathe.

content:
I learnt this from a Russian friend of mine. Although I can now shot like her, I will never out drink her.

1- Raise the glass, breathe in, breathe out, empty your lungs.
2- Knock it all back in one
3- Breathe in as you slam that motherfucker on the table. 

So simple. Now go take on the night and not look like a 15 year old just discovering the nectar of the gods for the first time.

EDIT: I have been promptly told by many redditors; there is a second technique which is the opposite of the one stated above,
Breath IN before the shot, then breath OUT after. It is effectively the same thing but props to the many who have commented with this.
