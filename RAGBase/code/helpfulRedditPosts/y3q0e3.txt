LPT: The best and quickest way to get the salary you deserve is job hop

Note that this may not be applicable to every industry. 

Don't stay loyal to a company if they aren't treating you well and compensating you adequately. Most people could easily get a 10/15% pay rise by moving company.  I'd been at my previous employer for 5 years, didn't receive a pay rise despite company posting record profits. Decided to move company to a similar role (no promotion/additional responsibilities) and got a 65% payrise.  Companies will only value you at your worth when you leave.
