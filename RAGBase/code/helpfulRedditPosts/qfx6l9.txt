LPT: You are not responsible for your first thought. You are, however, responsible for your second thought and your first action.

content:
It's common to have negative thoughts about yourself, situations, or others. But, please remember that thoughts are not facts. When you're feeling stuck and hopeless, do not think you are a failure or that you will never recover. Instead, focus on your second thought: *What can I do to turn this around?* *What is a less disordered way of thinking about this situation?* And then your first action: *I'm going to let go of what's not working.* *I'm listing options to help me move forward.* *I'm going to choose recovery.*
