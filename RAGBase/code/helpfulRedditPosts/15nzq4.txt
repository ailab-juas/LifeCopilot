LPT: Take a powder at the beach

content:
PROBLEM:  You love walking barefoot at the beach but can't get all the sand off your widdle toesie wosies 

SOLUTION: Bring baby powder along and leave it in the car.  Give your feet a good dusting before you put your socks back on.  Like magic, the sand falls off.

EDIT: Undoubtably there is a drying effect also, but I think the reason this works is not that the baby powder absorbs the moisture from the sand but rather because the size of the powder granules is smaller than the size of the sand grains.  They get underneath the sand to undermine the sands adhesion to your skin. 

EDIT 2:In some beaches the sand is not fine grained, and dry and warm. That sand will just fall off on its own. Some beaches (Long Island and Northern California) have sand that is more granular and sticky. They also have seasons other than WARM AND DRY. Some seasons are cold and wet. So sand can be cold and wet, too and sticky. And some people STILL enjoy walking around barefoot in that. 

Baby powder (and someone mentioned a cheap painter's brush which I thought was a good idea too) is a solution for this kind of sticky sand and the sand that gets between your toes and where ever else you may have gotten it (if you know what I mean) etc.
