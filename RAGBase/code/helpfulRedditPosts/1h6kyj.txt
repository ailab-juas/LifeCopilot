Protip for all dog owners: hunter orange collars

There's a reason this color is used by hunters all over the world. It doesn't blend in with anything. Keeps hunters from getting shot, and a flash of bright orange may be all that stands between Fifi and some SUV's tire. 

Your dog doesn't care what color his collar is. Odds are it's not even in his visible spectrum. It's really about your vanity vs the dog's safety. Put the dog first and  get them the best shot at surviving long enough for animal control to pick them up if they get lost.
