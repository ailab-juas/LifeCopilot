LPT: If you haven't already started thawing your turkey get on it now!

content:
In the fridge people smarter than I say estimate 24 hrs per 4 lbs of turkey. Last Thanksgiving was my first time cooking the bird and I didn't realize they take so long to thaw so the night before I was trying to brine a frozen bird. Hopefully this helps someone! Also Alton Brown's recipe is the best: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/good-eats-roast-turkey-recipe.html
