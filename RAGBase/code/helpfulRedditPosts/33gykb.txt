LPT: This is for all of you approaching finals week: If you find yourself procrastinating on something, tell yourself to do it for just 5 minutes

content:
Starting is the worst part.

Once you do something you have been dreading for 5 minutes, you realize it's not nearly as bad as you imagined and will usually keep going. Pretty soon you'll be done! 

I am currently finishing up my last semester and I wanted to share this little trick that helped me through these past few years.

Good luck guys.
