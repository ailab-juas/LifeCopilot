LPT: If you are ever homeless and cold..

LPT: If you are ever homeless and stuck sleeping on the street and it becomes too cold outside, find a 24/7 laundromat. At the back of the building you will find the dryer vents, this will help you to stay warm. 

Edit: typo &amp; update
Copy and pasted my response to your questions.

Thank you for your good vibes, and I am in fact doing much better. I left an abusive relationship, got off the streets and I am working again. I have a really awesome and supportive girl friend in my life now, I've also gotten clean off hard drugs. I continue to search for better employment and dream to have my own home one day and perhaps a family. And maybe even go to school and pursue my dreams. "The only thing you can count on is change"
