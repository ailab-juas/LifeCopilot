LPT: Teach your dog some nose work for those winter days when you don't want to go for a walk

content:
I shared this in another thread with someone looking for ways to entertain their dog while quarantined.  I figured this may help others so posting here.  

I've trained my last two staffies to do nose work.  It's very easy to train and you can get the dog exhausted with very little effort on your part (ie: hiding a treat and having them find it).  Get four to six empty Amazon boxes.  Spread them around the room.  Get the doggo to sit/stay with one of their favourite treats in your hand.  Let them watch you go to each box and go through the motions of putting the treat in each one.   Only really put it in one box.  Tell the dog to 'find it' and let them sniff all the boxes until they get the treat and reward like crazy when they do it.  Repeat it over and over for like a half hour and eventually you'll notice them starting to really use their sniffer to go quickly to the right box for the treat.  If you are confident they have the idea down, get rid of the boxes and go through the motions of pretending to hide the treat in several places in the room and only drop it in one spot.  Then have them find it and they'll start searching the room.  Once you have them doing that, put them in an adjacent room where they can't see you, have them sit/stay, go hide the treat somewhere reasonable in the other room and then have them find it.  Rinse and repeat until they have it down.

A 30 minute game of playing find it and you'll have a dog panting their butt off exhausted and you'll just have to walk around hiding treats so minimal effort for you.  It's gotten me through many a winter day where I don't want to go for a walk.  Good luck!!
