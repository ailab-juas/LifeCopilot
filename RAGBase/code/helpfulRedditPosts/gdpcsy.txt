LPT: Don't share all the same chores with your significant other. If you can, find what they hate doing that you don't mind, and offer a comparable chore that you hate but they don't mind as a trade.

content:
My wife would rather do anything than cook and I'd rather do anything than wash the dishes.  She doesn't mind washing dishes and I am totally ok doing all the cooking.  We finish each day almost feeling guilty because we got to do the easy thing and they did the worst thing, and it makes us feel super grateful to each other.  It's like we're both getting undeserved bonus points in the relationship at the same time!
