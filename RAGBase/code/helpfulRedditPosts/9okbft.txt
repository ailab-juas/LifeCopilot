[LPT] Don't have friends in a quiet apartment complex? Plan a fun event and go door to door knocking inviting people over. It turns out a lot of people are super lonely and it's fairly easy to get a group of random people to do stuff.

**For mods:**

This isn't common sense.  Why?  Because it works insanely well and very few people do it.  Common sense is something most people recognize.

**Tips to make this work even better:**

\-Work on your smile.  A good smile makes you a lot less intimidating.

\-Make it clear that you already have everything well-planned.

\-Make it clear you live close by or in the same apartment complex.  That way you don't appear to be some totally random guy.

\-Have the meeting spot be near the apartment complex and then carpool to the destination.  It's a lot easier to go as a group together as opposed to trying to meet up at a location.

\-Bring a "battle buddy."  For some reason I always get better results if I go around inviting people in a pair than alone.

\-If you have a girl who is a friend bring her.  This helps a ton with inviting girls.  You're a lot less intimidating to girls if you have one with you.

**Ideas:**

Remember it doesn't need to be a creative idea.  Fun is more important.  Here are some ideas:

\-Sledding

\-Hiking

\-Laser Tag

\-Paintball with slingshots

\-Board Games

\-Movie Night

\-Ultimate Frisbee

**Examples:**

Here are some examples of how I word my invitation.

\-"Hey!  We live downstairs and we're getting a group to go sledding.  We have a ton of sleds so you don't need to have your own!  Wanna come?"

\-"Hey!  We're you're neighbors and we're trying to get a group to play laser tag!  It's only $5 to play.  Wanna come?"

\-"Hey!  We live across the street and we're holding a big dance party in the courtyard at 8 tonight!  One of our friends will be the DJ.  If you wanna come just walk outside at 8 and come join us!"
