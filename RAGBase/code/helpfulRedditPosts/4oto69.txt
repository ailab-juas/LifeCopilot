YSK - You may have free tickets or discount codes in your Ticketmaster account as a result of a recent class action lawsuit.

content:
They just went out yesterday. If you bought tickets between 1999 and 2013 you should have some. I ended up having like 20 discount codes and 30 vouchers for 2 free tickets. They are apparently only good for a limited number of events though, and they haven't said which ones yet.

Log in to your account, go to my account, then click on "Active Vouchers". (Or just [click here](https://www.ticketmaster.com/member/vouchers)) Note, this only works on the full site, doesn't seem to work on the app or mobile site.
