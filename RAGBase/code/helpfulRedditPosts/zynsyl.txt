title:
YSK that homeless shelters don't need you to serve food on Thanksgiving and Christmas

content:
Why YSK. They already have all the help they need serving food on those days. Many shelters are overwhelmed with volunteers on those days, especially people who only want to work the front line. If you really want to help, volunteer on other days, or donate money. The shelter I worked in encouraged Christmas and Thanksgiving volunteers to bring canned food because it was more useful than the surplus of volunteers.

EDIT: It has been pointed out that I make an overly broad statement here, and I think they're right. The more accurate statement should be that you shouldn't just assume that they need you to serve food on those days, and not on other days or do other work. If you want to help, call them to see what they need and be open to tasks and times that might not be what you expected.
