LPT : If you have little money to donate but wanted to give as much impact as you can, consider donating to third-world country scholarship. In my country, 50 USD could secure living cost of 1 student for an entire month.

content:
For reference, in Indonesia, 450 USD covers engineering tuition for 1 semester. 1700 (or less) USD covers medical school tuition for 1 semester.one decent meal costs 0.6 USD.

 Living cost in Bangkok, Thailand is around 500 USD/month. Minimum wage in my country is ~150 USD/month. 

Of course, this is just to give you an idea how "little" amount of money can help people in developing countries. I'm not saying it's better to donate to poorer countries

.

Edit : wow turns out many people are excited about this LPT, check the comments, there are some donation recommendation from various countries. Dont forget to background check everything, don't get scammed ok. Good luck!

.

Edit 2 : what if... We create a subreddit to personally connect people that might REALLY need that extra 20 bucks a month? It would be similiar to r/language_exchange . No middle person, no corporation. DM me if you have ideas on how to do that effectively, with little-to-no chance of abuse

.

Edit 3 : [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/jj97yl/is_there_sub_that_connects_donator_and_receiver/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) suggest that similiar sub already exist, but it's much broader. Do you think creating a sub for small 1 to 1 donation for academic purpose only is still needed?
