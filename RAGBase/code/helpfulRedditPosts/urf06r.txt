YSK What to do if you ever find yourself in an active shooter incident (Run, Hide, Fight)

content:
WHY YSK: Because it may save your life. 

If you are ever caught in an active shooter incident, the FBI and DHS recommend you do the following:   

**Run, Hide, Fight**

RUN: Wherever you go, be aware of alternate exits.
   
Quickly and cautiously evacuate in a direction away from the attacker.  
  
Don't hesitate. Seconds matter.  

Remember windows and emergency exits.  
  
Leave belongings behind.  
  
Keep your empty hands raised and clearly visible when exiting a building.  
  
Follow all instructions from the police.  
  
Don't stop until you're sure you've reached a safe location.   
   
HIDE: If there is no safe escape route, find a good hiding place.   
   
Lock and barricade doors.   
   
Silence cell phones.   

Prepare a defense plan.   
   
FIGHT:Â  Fight only as a last resort.   
   
Use available objects as improvised weapons.   
   
Use teamwork and surprise. A coordinated ambush can incapacitate an attacker.   
   
You're fighting for your life. Be aggressive and commit to your actions
   
***Don't fight fair! ***  
   
STOP THE BLEED: A victim can die of uncontrolled blood loss in 5 minutes or less.   
   
Apply pressure or a tourniquet to control severe bleeding.

Edit: Some good convos and additional advice in the comments below.  Thanks to all who are contributing to the conversation.  I am seeing several common themes in the comments and felt I should address them here as a batch. 

Theme 1: This only happens in America   
   
America is not the only country that has experienced active shooter incidents (e.g., Canada, Sweden, France, etc.). The advice also works well for edge weapon attacks. To think this advice will never be useful anywhere else is naive in my opinion.  Ultimately,  my motto is to prepare for the worst but hope for the best.   
   
Theme 2: Conceal and Carry   
   
I am not going to comment on pros and cons of gun control but focus on conceal/carry as a potential defense against an active shooter.    
   
First, I think that similar advice applies, especially if you have family members with you. Get your family out to safety before you engage a shooter (i.e., run). Hide under cover if you cannot get out safely. Fight if safe to do so or you have received training on engaging and subduing active shooters. 
  
If you decide to fight, there are some factors you should consider such as trying not to be mistaken for the shooter ([example](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/17/us/concealed-open-carry-guns-police/index.html)). 
   
There appears to be some good advice on how to handle yourself overall through this site: https://chrishernandezauthor.com/2016/09/04/im-a-concealed-carrier-should-i-engage-an-active-shooter   

Theme 3: You must be an American.  
     
I am not but still feel I need to be prepared, just in case.
