LPT: Don't get too attached to "dream" schools or "dream" jobs before you really get some first-hand experience. Most of these places/careers are considered "good" because of abstract prestige, not based on having healthy environments that promote growth and personal happiness.

It's easy to end up at a school, job, or career just based on a burning ambition to say that is where you go or what you do, but that's not enough. 

**You may think if you get into XYZ school you are set for life** having it on your resume, but there might be a school out there that is less prestigious (but certainly *prestigious enough*) AND you would learn more there and better, develop more professionally and intellectually, and make better and more useful connections - which is what school is really for. **Keep your options open for the best school** ***for you***.

**There are a lot of prestigious jobs that are way more stressful than people think from the outside** and are also not a good fit for most personality types, yet so many people want them. Also, prestigious institutions rarely are highly ranked based on how well they treat their employees and having a non-toxic work environment - in fact, it's often the opposite. 

**Prestigious institutions are often less focused on employee retention** because they know people want to work there just for the name and that, if you leave, there are so many others lining up for your job they can spare you easily.  It doesn't matter if you are a brain surgeon at Johns Hopkins, an Astronaut at NASA, junior faculty at Harvard, or an endangered species veterinarian working for the World Wildlife Fund - you are expendable and you will likely be working with a bunch of people driven by pure ambition. 

Sometimes you have to get there to really know how bad it is for you, and that is the other part of the LPT. ***Don't get stuck in sunk-costs thinking and caught with the golden handcuffs of feeling you have to stay in a bad situation because you worked so hard to get there and/or you'll never get a better opportunity.***

*Source: I have gotten into all my "dream" schools and all my "dream" jobs at very prestigious institutions (and been at less "dream-y" schools and institutions). This LPT is based on my own first-hand experience and largely on what I saw around me with my peers and colleagues. I'm still there and I still see it happening. I see so much misery and unhappiness that just doesn't have to be there.*
