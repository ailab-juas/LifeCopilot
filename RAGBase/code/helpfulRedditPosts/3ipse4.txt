title:
LPT: Use a king size comforter on a queen size bed and never fight over cover again.

content:
Go up a size on any comforter.

EDIT: I've been KARMALIZED!

EDIT: A comforter is similar to a duvet. I call it a comforter because I'm a deep south American. I don't know any better. TIL a lot about comforters/duvets and a woman's ability to become a burrito. We could feed the world! 

Also, I like my idea better than separate beds or covers because I enjoy being able to touch my SO under the cover. 

Those who hated this lpt were very funny with your metaphors.
