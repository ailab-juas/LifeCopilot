title:
LPT: If someone you see regularly acts weird or strange around you, they probably like you. Interacting with them is better than ignoring them.

content:
Whether it is at school or at work or even the gym, if you notice that someone acts differently around you, they are probably into you.

Interacting with them will likely relieve the awkwardness, instead of ignoring them.

EDIT: Shyness is also included in this. I meant like as in they can be an acquaintance or even a friend, nothing romantic was implied. I think people need to make a distinction between someone who is a little socially awkward and someone who is a total creep. People in here are thinking about worst case scenarios. This LPT can definitely apply to both genders.
