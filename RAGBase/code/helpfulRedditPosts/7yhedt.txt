LPT: As a manager, give praise in public and give discipline in private.

content:
In an old job in "Corporate America" I had a manager who would always share with employees encouragement and kind words of praise within earshot of other employees, and would offer words of critisicm and suggestions for improvement in private (in his office or a conference room). This set up an environment of positive reinforcement and gave employees respect and honesty they needed to perform at a higher level.


Edit: Good call by /u/slumdawg11b for pointing out that this applies to any leadership role, and /u/airforcefalco that it applies to parenting. 


Edit 2: Lots of folks rightfully expressing that this is a catch-all method and knowing your employees' personally to effectively give praise and discipline is the best way to go.
