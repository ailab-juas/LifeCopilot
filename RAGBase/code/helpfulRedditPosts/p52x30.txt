LPT: If you’re having surgery, do yourself a favor and shave your beard baby face smooth.

content:

As an anesthetist, when we need to ventilate oxygen into you when you’re asleep, it is significantly more difficult to do so when there is a beard involved. The air leaks from all sides of the mask and it could be the difference between a life and death situation. 

When one of my patients has a beard, I always place them under a difficult airway possibility. 

Ive never had anyone die on me, but I have had encounters where multiple people were required in the room to help make a seal around the beard to give oxygen.

Cheers to having a smooth surgery and I hope you get well soon.
