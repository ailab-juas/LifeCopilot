LPT: If you are going on a blind date or meeting someone for the first time in person, set an alarm on your phone that will go off about 25-30 minutes in and have it set to your phone's ringtone. You can pretend it is a call and be able to have an excuse to leave if you need to without being rude.

Edit: Some of y'all are actually big mad and trying to police my post. I never said you had to ghost them after. I never said abandon them and be an asshole. Some people just aren't very good under the pressure of the situation to be honest and say they're not interested. A lot of the time people will text after and say they didn't feel chemistry or aren't interested. I am someone who is too nervous to speak much at all on the first encounter, let alone say I'm not interested and leave. If you have the courage to stand up on a date and tell the girl "yeah I'm not feeling this" and leave then good for you but some people are too shy to do that. 

Edit 2: Someone actually took the time to send me a message and tell me to kill myself. My LPT is rude but telling me to kill myself isn't? Lol. Just downvote and move on
