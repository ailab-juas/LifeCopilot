LPT: If it is super hot and you're trying to sleep, cold shower + hot tea = KO

content:
I've always had trouble falling asleep and it's only magnified when my room is ~90 degrees (F) at night. 

What I've started doing is to take a cold shower - long enough to *actually* cool your body down, not a 2 minute shower, and drink hot herbal/camomile tea **while in the shower**. I get out feeling cool and comfortable, the drowsy effects of the tea starts to kick in, and I pass the hell out.

Doesn't necessarily get me through the whole night, but definitely helps me initially fall asleep.
