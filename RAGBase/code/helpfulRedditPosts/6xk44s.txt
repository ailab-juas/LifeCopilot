LPT: Teach your cat to associate a certain noise or call with being fed. If it runs away or escapes your house, you can loudly make that noise and it will likely return.

I guess make sure it's a noise you could easily make louder? I feel like I'm calling hogs to feed when I call for my cats to eat, but the point is, I could scream the noise as opposed to more aggressively shaking an already quiet bag of treats or something. 

My cat got out and came sprinting from the great-beyond-our-backyard-fence when I'd called him to come eat.

I don't know if it'll help with dogs or other critters, but it's certainly worth a shot in a would-be worst case scenario.
