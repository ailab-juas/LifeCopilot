LPT: Keep inviting that friend who always says no

content:
If you have a friend or coworker who you have invited to do things with you or your group of friends and they continually decline, don't stop inviting them unless they specifically tell you not to invite them any more. Some folks really would like to be included but really do have other obligations, or maybe they're just super shy and need to be invited several times before they feel like they can work up the courage to go. Or perhaps they are battling depression. Don't give up on that person. You may be just the person they need to get them out of their shell or to eventually become the kind of friend that helps them see the good in life and want to continue going on living. Be awesome

Edit: Thank you for the awards kind strangers!
