LPT: To avoid having your undershirt visible through a dress shirt, switch from white to grey undershirts. Even if you are light skinned, grey is much closer to human skin tone and will be still be invisible underneath fine white dress shirts.

WILL BE STILL BE

Edit: To clarify what you want to avoid, [it's this look](http://www.primermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/SuitNoNos/SuitNoNos_WhiteUndershirt.jpg). This is like the male equivalent of the visible panty line. When wearing a dress shirt, your undershirt should not be visible at all. It is, after all, a form of underwear. You wouldn't wear a suit with your boxers hanging out over your rear, would you?

I personally think the best option is a slim v-neck undershirt in heather grey.
