LPT: With the exception of sex, do not use your bed for anything other than sleep. This conditions your brain to make you sleepy when you lay down at night, and go to sleep faster.

As the title states, use your bed **only** for sleep, with the exception of sex.  This helps your brain prepare to sleep because it knows when you lay down you plan on sleeping. It's like when you walk into a bathroom and didn't need to pee, but now that they're in one you might as well. When you laid down in bed, you may not have been tired, but now that you're in it you might as well get some sleep.

This has helped me very much with quickly falling asleep at night and while some might state this is an obvious tip, it's also something very easily overlooked by many people, including myself at one point.

**Edit:** As I'm finding out, which does not come as a big surprise, this works for a lot of people but not for a lot of others. :p But hey, everyone is different and solutions gotta start somewhere! Even if it doesn't work for you, at least you know what doesn't work ;)
