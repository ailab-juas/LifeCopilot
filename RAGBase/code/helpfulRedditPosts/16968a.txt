LPT:  Before you start doing any wedding planning, make a wedding-only email account.

content:
The same could probably go for other things, such as college planning.  I was married four months ago and I STILL get tons of emails from bridal shops, websites, etc.  Do what I wish I did:  Make a new email to give only to wedding vendors.  That way, all of your wedding info will be together and when the wedding is over, boom.  No unnecessary wedding emails.
