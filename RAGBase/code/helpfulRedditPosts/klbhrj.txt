LPT: When dressing for cold weather prioritize circulation over insulation

content:
As a wilderness guide one of the biggest mistakes I see people make when dressing for harsh winter conditions is bringing improperly fitted boots and gloves.  Hampering circulation to your extremities is surprisingly easy to do, and becomes more apparent in the cold.  Boots tied to tightly or tightly fitting gloves hamper your circulation and prevent your warmed blood from getting to your fingers and toes.  It doesn’t matter what a pair of gloves/boots are rated for if there is no heat from circulation to contain (clothes do not warm you, they trap your natural body heat).  Loosen your boots much more than you would in summer months and ensure your gloves don’t fit too tightly around the wrist.  

If you find your feet cold loosen your boots.  If your fingers start going numb, remove your gloves, shake your hands, and pocket them for a few minutes (never blow on your hands).
