Why YSK:  

Lots of people with development disorders like Autism and ADHD don't necessarily know they have it because they never had a proper diagnosis. Or they keep their diagnosis a secret. Also, lots of people with these development disorders blend in well in society, so it is hard to recognize off the bat if someone has it.

Lots of people who have socially unacceptable behavior like talking to much aren't, obsessing over certain topics, not making eye contact etc. aren't necessarily doing it intentionally, but rather because they have a development disorder like Autism or ADHD. Understanding the symptoms of things like Autism or ADHD might help you to better understand the way the way people with development disorders act and think; and better educate people you know in your life who don't already know this.

* As said in the comments, not every person that is socially awkward has a development disorder. But if someone seems a bit off (like struggling to maintain eye contact, obsessing over certain topics, interrupting others when speaking, getting stressed out when hearing certain noises that most others wouldn't mind), there's a good chance they might have a development disorder, and it would be good to be more understanding of the way they act.

And also, while this should be obvious, you shouldn't try diagnosing someone with a development disorder unless if your a trained professional.
