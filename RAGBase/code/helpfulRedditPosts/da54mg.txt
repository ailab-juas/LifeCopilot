YSK about Traffickcam, an app to upload photos of your hotel room. These photos are used to determine where perpetrators of sex trafficking are committing their crimes.

&gt; You can help the fight against sex trafficking yourself! TraffickCam is an app you can download on your phone. When you stay in hotels/motels you can take pictures of the room and where you're staying.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Law enforcement can then match up hotels/motels to the one of trafficked victims. Traffickers will use the rooms to take pictures for advertising. They then compare them and if there's matches they can get a step closer to those horrible people. If you frequently stay in hotels/motels, even if you don't, please get the app and you just might help save someone.
