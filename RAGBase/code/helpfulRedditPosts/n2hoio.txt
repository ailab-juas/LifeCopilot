LPT: Save People Embarrassment with 10 Second Rule

content:
Learned this randomly from a client on a photo shoot when I asked her to fix her hair, apologizing in advance, because I never want a subject to feel uncomfortable. If they feel off it shows and some people are sensitive in ways you don’t expect.

She shot back “Oh don’t apologize” and gave me this LPT:

If you feel the urge to comment on someone, ask yourself if they can address it in 10 seconds or less. If so, you’re saving them embarrassment later. If not, you’re still saving them embarrassment now by NOT bringing it up.

For example: You're at a business dinner. “You have something in your teeth” is something people appreciate knowing *now*. They don’t want the next contact at the event to see that. But say they wore too casual an outfit to this formal event, not so much the thing you want to point out since they're stuck with it anyway.

I thought it was a great, simple way to teach empathy that covered so many bases at once, including the obviously rude stuff like weight, height, etc.

Plus I pretend to confuse this with the 5 Second Rule when I drop really good food on the floor.
