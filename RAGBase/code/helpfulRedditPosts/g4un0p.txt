LPT: Clean as you cook or donâ€™t cook at all!

That was mindblowing for me the first time I read it.

It really helped keep my kitchen clean. Gotta wait 5 min while something is ready ? No problem, time to clean something in the meantime.

Another rule that helped me a lot is cleaning in the evening so that I wake up to a fresh kitchen every morning.
