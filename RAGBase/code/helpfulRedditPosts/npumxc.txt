LPT: When you stop thinking things you may do are "embarrassing" other people around you will not find it embarrassing either. Take pride when you do something embarrassing and treat it like its normal.

A lot of people have social anxiety (myself included) but once you start doing things that normal people would think are embarrassing and treat it as something normal, your brain and other people will realise that it wasn't actually that embarrassing.

Ok just to clear something up, im not saying going out naked in public and acting normal is what should be done. (this is a blatant disregard for a lot of social norms) but things as little as asking out a crush, getting injured in a dumb way or making a stupid statement that was incorrect can all be seen as embarrassing but once you brush that off and just do treat it like its normal it will be that way (and you get a confidence boost!)
