"I have tinnitus and it is high pitched synthesiser and it's all the time. The rest of my life. I am a former 0311 marine (infantry). Open your mouth if you see a shockwave and cover your ears. Also turn away" — u/toolfan73

"They tought me in the army to be on my elbows and knees, facing away from the explosion, abdomen not touching the ground, put your thumbs in your ears, your fingers over your eyes, and open your mouth.

It is to prevent intestinal, ear, and lung damage caused by explosives, oh and to prevent your eyes from leaving the sockets." — u/xyrt123
