LPT: How To Get A Raise

content:
Turns out I've become pretty good at this over the years.  It's something I've done multiple times and have had success at that has surprised even me.  I've also helped my friends in this area get significant advances.  

First tip.  don't talk about Percentage raises.  Percentage raises are totally disconnected from value and are all about making small $ numbers look big (a 7% raise sounds nice but it's only $180/paycheck after tax if you get paid semi-monthly and were on $100k)

* **Pre-Requisites**

* Be good at your job  Seriously, there's no substitute for this.  This advice will only work for people who DESERVE  a raise.
* Make sure your request has natural timing.  Don't ask for a raise if the company is fucked if you quit.  Ask for a raise AFTER you've saved their ass, not while you're saving it.  No-one responds well to blackmail. 
* Have skills that transfer.  There is a range that your company will pay you that has an upper limit on your value and a lower limit on what they assume your value is to others.  The more transferrable your skills are the closer you'll get paid to that upper bound of what you're worth (remember, if they pay you one penny more than you're worth then they're making a mistake.  It happens, but it's not our goal here. Our goal is to clarify your worth and to get paid as close to it as possible).  Having skills that transfer means you de-emphasize skills that are company specific and focus on market-wide skills.  Be careful what you volunteer for.  


* **Ask for a performance review** This is the formal setting to talk about your worth.  Make sure that you let your manager know that your goal in your review is to review your value to the company.  Don't surprise them with your agenda.  You're not there to just listen.  You want to talk about the value you add to the company.  Saying this isn't threatening them and it's not demanding.  It's the very definition of what a performance review is for.  But it clearly suggests that your motive is your remuneration with respect to your value.  

* **Know what will make you happy and let them know what it is** Make sure you're clear about what will make you happy. It's not a negotiation. It's a request to be made happy and this is what will do that. Say something that communicates that you're working hard to exceed their expectations and that this is the moment where you hope they'll reciprocate.
If they respond with negotiation then avoid it. Take the high road. "I'd like to avoid a negotiation where we all feel like we've not quite gotten what we hope for. I hope I'm giving you everything you hope for from me and I want this outcome to reflect that". This is about having earned it before asking for it, but then not being shy about asking for it.

* **Win over the influencers** If your manager is your buddy but you're not sure if they control your pay then pull him/her into your plan. Ask "I want to have a conversation about my worth in order to talk about my salary and I'd like your advice on how to go about it." You've just requested what feels like a small favor from them but may be an enormous favor to you. They're becoming invested in your goal. They can't advise you on how best to position yourself to get paid what you're worth without also representing you in the best light to the people that might come asking their viewpoint.

* **Preparation: Have concrete data** If you're going to say you're more productive than others, then quantify it. Do your research before your meeting. It shows you're professionalism in the same moment that you're claiming your professionalism. Focus on results more than effort. Results equate to value, effort only speaks to (your) cost.

* **There's no 'company policy' about what you get paid** If you're worth it (ie, you're not a commodity) then you can get paid for it. If anyone quotes company policy at you, divert them. "If it's ok, I'd like to focus on what value I add and then come back to how you can respond to that". If you're getting underpaid it suits the company to make a deal quickly before all the facts in your favor are laid out. You've prepared for this and you need to make sure that they understand the way the world looks to you.

* **If the raise isn't happening find out why** "Do you feel that I'm over-valuing myself?" That's a Great question to ask. It clarifies what you're discussing. Is it my worth that we disagree on? Or is it just that you haven't 'got the budget'. If they say they haven't got the budget (or something like it) then say that you understand and of course it's possible that you're over-estimating your worth anyway and that you'll have to do some more research on it as this is obviously meaningful to you.  The implication is that you're about to go job hunting but you're not threatening them. You're encouraging them toward finding an agreed valuation of your services.
