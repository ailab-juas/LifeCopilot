LPT: Use the recycle air feature on your cars AC system! Instead of constantly fighting to cool the hot air outside, it will cool the already cooled air inside your car. Saving gas, and cooling your car faster.

I notice many of my family and friends never use this feature! I donâ€™t recommend using it while smoking because it will stink up your vents. Hope this helps anyone trying to stay cool! Also, if your cars AC sucks... look into getting an Ac re-charge kit. It will refill the refrigerant in your cars AC unit.
