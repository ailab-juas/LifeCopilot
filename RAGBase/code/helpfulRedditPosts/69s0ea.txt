title:
LPT when starting a new job try finding out how long the other employees have worked there

content:
If all the employees have only been working there for a few weeks/months and there are none that have worked long term the company probably treats workers like shit, doesn't pay on time, doesn't pay right, or otherwise cheats the workers.
