LPT: Don't reply to texts immediately!

content:
If someone texts you something like "ok I'll send it to you later today" don't reply "ok thanks" immediately. The person you're texting to will probably forget about it and you'll end up waiting for ages. If you don't want to sound rude saying something like "you probably forgot to send me that thing, can you do that now?" just wait until the end of the day and reply the "ok thanks"; this way you reminded him of his promise without being disrespectful. I use it very often as I happen to text old people that always forget to reply...
