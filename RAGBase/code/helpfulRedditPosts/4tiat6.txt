LPT: Don't give your friends gifts based on their hobby, unless it's your hobby too.

content:
E.g. don't buy fishing gear for a fisherman, or collectibles for a collector, unless you know as much about the topic as your friend does. 

Otherwise, chances are that you will gift something they already have a better version of, something kitschy, or not well-researched compared to what they already have and know.

Instead, it may be a better bet to make an introductory gift based on *your* hobby, provided you verify your friend has any interest or curiosity about the subject.
