YSK that sometimes when we tell people, especially children, to just "be themselves," we are mistaking a request for help with social skills for a self-esteem problem.

Let me start by saying that of course self-esteem problems and poor social skills can coexist. But social skills are just that, they're skills. They need to be learned and practised. Kids don't all learn at the same rate, and it can be hard for them to clearly express the nature of the interpersonal problems they're having. Heck, adults struggle with that. My point is that sometimes when kids are struggling socially, they may need some coaching in their social skills in addition to a pep talk.

When I was a kid, I struggled socially because I talked way too much and wouldn't really let the other kids participate when we played together. When I asked adults why other kids didn't like me, they told me to just be myself, so the problem persisted. I don't know what the best ways are to assess social skills in children, but I think this is something to be aware of when we talk to kids.
