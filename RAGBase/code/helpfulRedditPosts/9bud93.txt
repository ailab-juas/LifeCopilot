LPT: If you have a hard time getting up in the morning, take some deep breaths to get oxygen to your brain, organs and muscles

content:
The burst of oxygen will keep you from hitting the snooze button, and will make it easier to get out of bed and get moving.

EDIT: I'm a little confused/horrified that people are getting notifications for this. No pitchforks please.
