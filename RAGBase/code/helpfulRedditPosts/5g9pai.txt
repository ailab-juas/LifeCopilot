LPT: Motivate people by giving them choices, even if the choices are illusory.

content:
People feel more valued or in control if they get to make choices about the task ahead. I learned from taking care of my nephew that if I ask him "What do you want for lunch?" It can turn into an endless thing about why I don't have his favourite food or why we can't go to McDonalds. Instead I say "Do you want pasta or toasted sandwiches for lunch?" He makes a choice and feels some measure of control even though I have maintained control over what I have to make.


This can be manipulative but if you're managing a team of people with a lot less experience than you it can be tempting to map out every aspect of how they do a job. Some jobs are highly complex and time-sensitive and have to be done a certain way. Wherever possible find areas where people working under you can make choices or use initiative safely. They are more likely to take pride in what they're doing and take ownership of the task if they have some measure of input.



EDIT: Some commenters seem to be missing the 'even if' in the title. I'm not saying manipulate people all the time. Where possible, give them genuine scope for initiative and genuine choices. If necessary, and without being too obvious about it, manufacture choices. People work well with structure. Too much and you're micro-managing. Too little and you're giving up control. Good managers should avoid these two extremes.
