title:
YSK: that if something's worth doing, it's worth doing poorly.

content:
A wise man once said that, I can't remember where I heard it, but it boils down to this:

Why YSK: If something is important, it's usually better to half-ass it than it is to not do it at all.

Some examples: 
Got a big test tomorrow and not up to studying? Study for 15 minutes. A 40 is much better than a 0.
Don't feel like working out today? Go for a walk.
Too busy for breakfast? Drink a cup of milk.
Stayed up too late? Go to bed right now. 3 hours of sleep is superior to none.
The pile of dirty dishes too daunting? Wash 5.
Can't do the whole yard? Mow the front.

The principle can be applied to various situations in life. Often times you may find that after you get started, you feel motivated to complete the task, but if not, hey...you did part of it, and that's nothing to sneeze at (and it's certainly better than nothing.)

Y'all take care of yourselves
