YSK An easy way to remember which months have 31 days is to use your knuckles.

content:
Hold your fists out next to each other, so your knuckles are facing up and the sides of your hands are touching.

Starting from the left, use your knuckle and the space between each knuckle to count the months. Each month that falls on a knuckle has 31 days. Each month that falls inbetween has 30 (or 29 for february).

This also works if you only have one hand! Simply loop around to the first knuckle. July and August both have 31 days.

Why YSK: I always had trouble remembering this, and the rhyming song never worked for me. But this really clicked and is much more logical.
