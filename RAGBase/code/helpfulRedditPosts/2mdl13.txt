YSK That Khan Academy has a whole (FREE) series of videos on topics about college (deciding to go, choosing a school, applying, PAYING etc.) which can be very helpful for current high school students and parents (I wish it was around when I was struggling through this quagmire)

When I went to school I toured one school, the school my mom went to, and that was all the help I got. Do yourself a favor and think before you act. High schoolers - your parents and teachers are probably telling you that you HAVE to go. You don't. Employers are mostly looking for experience (which you may not get in college) and a specific skillset (which you may not get in college). Parents - if you are going to send your kids to college (or just push them out the door) make sure your kids know what the hell they're doing before they leave. Please don't send them out without at least a basic understanding of how to finance their education.

Speaking from experience: $80k in debt, living with the inlaws, have two degrees and not using them...
