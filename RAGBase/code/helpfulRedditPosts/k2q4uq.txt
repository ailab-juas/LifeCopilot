title:
YSK That even if you are a guy you NEED to have a trash can in your toilet

***EDIT: …Guys I’m not a woman. I’m a gay guy. I’m not „being egoistic” by posting this YSK.***

Edit2: Also sorry for the wrong word in the title, I meant the **RESTROOM** english is not my first language.

Why YSK: For any female it is obvious that when they need to change their tampon/pad they will use the toilet for that purpose and throw the used one in the trash.

If you have any female guests anytime it will be a lifechanger for them - imagine you visit your friend and need to change a tampon and then boom you either have to flush it down the toilet and clog their toilet or go to the kitchen trashcan with the bloody piece of material in your hand.

Besides it is VERY useful for used toilet paper rolls and generally it is nice to have trashcans around the house so you store trash in them and empty them once a week/month instead of having to go to the main trashcan everytime you have trash or just throwing trash everywhere because you are too lazy to go to the main trashcan.

edit3 this blew up so much that I’m muting this but hey thanks for karma!
