title:
LPT: Do not show up to a party 30+ minutes early, unless you’ve checked with the host.

content:
Since it’s the Holiday season, this LPT feels relevant. Plain and simple, unless you’ve checked with the host, you’re likely to be a massive inconvenience if you arrive unnecessarily early to a party. 

The strong majority of party planning leads into the final few minutes, if not into the party, with food, decor, etc. Arriving early, even with the intention of helping, forces the host to either drop everything and entertain, or feel guilty as they disregard your presence. Show up early, not too early.
