LPT: Solo travel? Pack small souvenirs from home to give out as thanks or conversation starters.

content:
I'm [30F] from Australia, been to 32+ countries mostly solo and keep a stash of small toy kangaroos, koalas, pencils with Aussie animals and small animal keyrings in my hand luggage.

So many locals help me as a solo traveller, whether it's finding a bus, giving me change for automated toilets or helping with luggage, and it's a great way to show thanks. I use to feel bad when I had nothing to give in return.

On transport it's a great way for me to engage with any parents travelling with children in the same cabin/compartment/flight. 

Edit: thank you for the gold kind stranger!
