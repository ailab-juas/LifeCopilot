LPT: if you have a DSLR, use it as a high quality webcam for free

content:
If you're like anyone else and you're taking a lot of meetings on Zoom (or Teams or WebX or Meet, etc.), one of the best things you can do is have a nice quality camera. The built-in cameras on laptops and desktops usually have a very wide angle, poor-quality lens, and have to run at high ISO in slightly dim settings, which leads to a lot of noise when the room isn't incredibly bright.

Up until recently, if you wanted good quality video on a video conferencing app, you'd have to buy a webcam, which could get pretty expensive. The other option was to buy a video switcher with software (like OBS) and use that to interface your DSLR with your computer.

In 2020, it got a lot easier. Manufacturers like Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm and others released free webcam software to easily use your DSLR as a webcam. All you need is a USB-to-mini-HDMI cable or USB-to-mini-USB cord, depending on your camera's port.

**Here are some links to the webcam utilities of the most popular manufacturers:**

Tip: make sure your model camera is supported by the software. Some manufacturers only support a selection of models.

EDIT 2: yes, you can also use an old phone as a dedicated webcam if you don't have a DSLR. However, just like you wouldn't buy a new phone just to use as a webcam, I don't think most people are going out and buying DSLRs for webcam use. If you happen to *already have* a DSLR, the quality difference between a phone camera lens and a proper camera lens is massive.

EDIT 3: be aware that most of these utilities output at 1024x576. If you want even higher resolution, you'll need to buy a capture card. Credit to u/universal_rehearsal.

EDIT 5: according to u/pauljs75, using older DSLRs as a webcam for extended periods *can* cause sensor burnout, leading to more noise and blown pixels. If you have the choice, aim for cameras with more notable video features over still features.
