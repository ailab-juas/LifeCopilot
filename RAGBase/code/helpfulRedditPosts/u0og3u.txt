LPT: When meeting new people, instead of asking what they do for a living, ask what their Hobbies are. Most ppl get far more excited talking about their hobbies than their job.

Asking what people do for work can sometimes come off as tacky and superficial, and most people don't really care to talk about work because work kind of sucks for most of us, and we do it 40+ hours a week so we're all sick of it.

Everyone I use this tip on immedietly light up as soon as I show interest in their hobbies, without fail. That's where most people's passion actually lie, seeing as being able to make your career your passion is incredibly rare. 

Talking hobbies is also a great Segway to grow an acquaintance into a friend:
"Oh you play guitar, I'd love to hear you jam sometime!"
"You brew beer, sweet I'd love to try some!"
"You paint, I'd love to see your paintings!"

At my highschool reunion I got a lot of people deliberately asking each other about their hobbies rather than their career and everyone's conversations were extraordinarily interesting and impassioned. And it removed the jealousy or judgement that often coencides with discussions that go like:

"What do you do?"
"I work at Subway, how about you?"
"Cool! I'm a private equity manager at Bain Capital in NYC."
"Cool. ðŸ˜’"
