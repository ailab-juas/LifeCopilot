YSK: Chocolate Diamonds are a jewelry industry scam. Brown diamonds are the most common diamonds, and the "Chocolate Diamond" was marketed perfectly to sell something above its actual worth, since brown is an undesirable color

It's actually kind of brilliant though the way they were able to market garbage to us as valuable lol. In all fairness though, some are actually worth something based on treatment and such, but all in all, they managed to take a worthless rock that was never able to sell, and market it so perfectly that it's now a desirable piece of jewelry. Admirable, but still something you should know about before purchasing
