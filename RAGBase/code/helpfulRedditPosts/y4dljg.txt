YSK The BBB (Better Business Bureau) is just a review website.

content:
Many people are under the impression that the BBB is some government agency that ensures businesses and corporations are morally just. 
That is not the case at all. 

BBB is just a review website. Like Yelp. 

Why YSK: those complaints you made on BBB towards a business or company is not really going to go anywhere unless action is taken by the company itself. 
So when you call into customer service and try to leverage making a complaint on BBB, you’re not really creating a convincing argument for yourself. 
As an Ex Customer Service Live Chat agent, I’ve received this ‘threat’ many times. And trust us, it goes nowhere. We’ll do our best, truly, to help you; but BBB has little impact to medium-large business and companies.

Edit: editing this with a comment I made, and wanted to emphasize it here to not confuse anyone. 

“I may have worded my post in such a way where it advises BBB is useless. That is not the case.

 In the prompt I did advise that actions taken are solely up to the business/company and was only trying to emphasize that BBB is just a review website.”
