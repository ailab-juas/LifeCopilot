LPT: When someone asks you for help, show them how you find the answer rather than just giving it to them

content:
In particular when it comes to matters at work. I regularly get asked for help on a range of topics (largely technical) and people don't realise there was no special knowledge I had to find the answer... However, if I just give them the answer, it just reinforces the idea of interdependence and that it is just easier to ask someone. Teaching self sufficiency is more important than providing it...
