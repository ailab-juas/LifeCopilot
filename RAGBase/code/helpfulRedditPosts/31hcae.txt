[PC Gaming Wiki](http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home) is a user curated collection of Wikipedia-style articles collecting fixes and improvement hacks for PC games. I can't remember the last time I had to Google a problem I'm having with a game. The fix is always up there already. It's actually become a routine for me to visit a game's PCGW page before I even fire it up for the first time, just to see what kind of essential improvements the community recommends.
