title:
YSK to share your success stories with the hospital unit you've stayed on if you've been injured or sick

content:
Why YSK: Staff on hospital units especially in ICUs care for patients in their most vulnerable, traumatic moments of their lives. The vast majority of the time these staff members never know what becomes of patients once they have healed and returned to their daily lives or what happens to the families of patients that have sadly passed. Writing a simple card which states your name and the time you were there and an update brings so much joy and happiness to those who see so much sadness and loss. If you've ever had a prolonged stay in the hospital and feel comfortable sharing your recovery with the unit you stayed on it is highly suggested. Also, don't feel obligated to give food or gifts. A simple 'hey! I'm doing much better now!' is all that is needed.
