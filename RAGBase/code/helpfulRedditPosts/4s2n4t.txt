LPT- Don't let un-returned kindness poison you.

content:
For the last two years, I have considered a lady in my neighborhood a bitch.  I passed her walking her dog frequently and always gave her a kind wave and smile that was not returned.  I finally met her, and found that she had a stroke a few years ago.  She said, she always felt bad she could not return the gesture.
