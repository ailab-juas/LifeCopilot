LPT: If you want to pay for someone's meal, wait to say so until after they order. If someone offers to pay for your meal, let them order first.

content:
If you want to pay for someone's meal, you should let them order before you say something so they won't feel constrained with what they want to order and you can decide if you want to pay that much. 
On the other side, if someone offers to pay for your meal before you order, allow then to order first. Look at what they spent and spend similarly or less. If they are okay with you getting more they will most likely say so.

Edit: I think a good point a lot of people are making is if someone buys your food it would also be cool of you to buy drinks or desserts. 
And to specify I was thinking of a situation where you are with a work acquaintance or perhaps your boss is treating you to lunch and you're not sure what to order if they offer.

Edit: Just to clarify again when people say "I'm going to order what I want so don't offer to pay for me because I want something expensive " The first point of this LPT is to let the person fully order first THEN you pay for them, so you can fully know what you're going to pay.
