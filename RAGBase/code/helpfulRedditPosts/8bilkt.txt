title:
YSK that anyone can apply to be a member of your local Selective Service (Military Draft) Board

content:
These boards would, in the event of a war and subsequent draft, decide cases where draftees are requesting deferments for any number of reasons. You can check it out here: https://www.sss.gov/About/Agency-Structure/Local-Boards

You can serve for 20 years and it requires laughably minimal effort. I've been doing it for 10 years now and have never even met the other board members.
