LPT: Another for Dog owners; This is a simple way I hydrate my pup on hot days before we leave the house.

content:
Unless you have a superbly trained dog, asking them to drink water before you leave on a walk isn't exactly possible, and on a hot day they don't last very long.

So If I'm going out on a hike (hard to carry a lot of water), I'll give my dog a bowl of water with a 1/4 or 1/2 cup of *low sodium* Beef or Chicken ~~Broth~~ Stock

Dog chugs it down, we hit the trail and I can be have faith she isn't desperate for water as quickly as normal. This was actually recommended by her vet when she had dehydration from a stomach bug. 


And then you get a [happy dog!](http://i.imgur.com/8upJ5Z0.jpg)

EDITS:

 - OP learned much

 - Broth has Onion (bad for dogs)

 - Look for Stock not Broth

 - Make sure it's legitimately low/no salt. 

 - Homemade stock is really easy to make with left over bones, and water. Then freeze for future use. 

 - Be aware of dog Bloat, which could occur by drinking too much water before play
