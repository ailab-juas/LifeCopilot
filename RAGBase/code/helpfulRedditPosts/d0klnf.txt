LPT: If you're ever in a car crash don't tell anyone the accident was your fault even if you think it might be. Do not sign any document unless it's for the police or your insurance agent.

content:
This is why you have an insurance company. Let them handle it. The more you say at the scene, the more problems you might cause in your defense later. Be polite, but when it comes to assessing what happened its best to stay quiet.  Take photos of all vehicles involved and the accident scene and help anyone who might be injured, if it is safe to do so. 

You may think that the crash was 100% your fault and later learn that there were other factors that contributed to the crash that were outside of your control.
