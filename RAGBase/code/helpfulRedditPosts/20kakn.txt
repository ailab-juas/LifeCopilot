[Kiwix.org/m](http://kiwix.org/m) Requires 12GB free space

It works great on my wifi-only Android. It's good for reading and looking things up when you don't have a connection. 

The SD card needs to be formatted as NTFS to accept the whole file. Mine was FAT32 so I had to split them up. The [FAQ](http://kiwix.org/wiki/FAQ) shows you how. I downloaded the big file to my PC and split it *there before* transferring it to my Android.

If you go that route there's a little bit of difficulty involved but I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments.

EDIT: A few people asked about syncing/updating and unfortunately you can only re-download the file.
