LPT: Cashiers, hand the customer change first, THEN cash.

[Haven't searched to check if it's a repost, so apologies if that's the case.]

If you ever work behind a register or are just handing someone money, ALWAYS give them the loose change first and THEN their bills.

I can't explain the frustration and social disaster that comes when a cashier hands me a bunch of nickels and dimes precariously placed on some bills with my receipt while I'm already holding my food and wallet with a line of people behind me. 

EDIT: I too, work as a cashier. I try to change the world 1 Customer Paying With A $20 at a time.
