YSK: BEFORE you or your contractor dig a hole on your property; dial 811.

content:
[US&amp;CA only] Digging without knowing the approximate location of underground utilities can result in damage to gas, electric, communications, water and sewer lines, which can lead to service disruptions, serious injuries and costly repairs. 

Don't be another statistic.

Edit: Was oblivious to the fact that this may be region based.

Edit 2: After reading comment's; Dialing 811 in BC (Canada) will direct you to a 24/7  health inquiry service. 

Edit 3: Quebec as well. ^

Edit 4: Front Page! Hopefully more people can know. The "811" equivalent in British Columbia will be *6886. 811 is also the Health Line in, Alberta.

Edit 5: No more FP. Hopefully word gets out; read some not-so-lucky instances. Feel free to message me with other numbers for other regions, so I can add it to the post. I'm guessing that I need to be responsible, and organize this all for you guys. 

Edit 6: Hopefully I do this correctly; first time trying to organize/format on Reddit, really.

Edit 7: I didn't do too bad (after 7 tries). I'll update with more regions' info as I get it.
