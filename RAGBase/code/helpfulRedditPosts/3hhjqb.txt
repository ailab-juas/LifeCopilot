EDIT - Some of my common responses to various reactions here:

* Last Week Tonight [sited](https://youtu.be/i8xwLWb0lLY?t=11m55s) the University of Arkansas' findings that they **could not find a single case of food donation related liability**. If the federal law was ever tested or effectively overturned in court, we should know about it by now.

* For partially eaten leftovers and quickly perishable foods (e.g. restuarants): The only viable anti-waste solution I heard of found for them is to sell it to a pig farm for animal consumption - This is what many Vegas casinos do.

* Lots of non-profits are willing to pick up food.  The additional cost is at or near zero if the employees spend time facilitating unloading of old food that a non-profit picks up instead of time spent throwing it away.  Of course refrigerated or prepared food may vary.

* Companies like grocery stores can already track food depreciation/loss for accounting purposes.  Any donated food simply moves to a different column on a balance sheet and becomes tax deductible.
