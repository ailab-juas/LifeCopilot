LPT: When moving, pack 1 box with toilet paper, paper towels, and everything you need to cook a hot meal, Label it "BOX ONE" and transport it in the car with you, so you don't have to hunt for anything your first night there.

Also, pack a suitcase with clean clothes and self-care supplies, sheets, your pillow, and a towel, so you don't have to have found the boxes with those things to clean up and go to bed. 

I also pack dishes in paper towels. It sounds wasteful, until you're using all those paper towels for cleaning the new home.
