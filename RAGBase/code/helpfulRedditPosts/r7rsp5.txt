LPT: Tip extra at your "regular" restaurant. They will be happy to see you and get to know you.

content:
I'm not wealthy, but I started tipping about 25-30% at a restaurant we like, and servers are always happy to see us. We have gotten to know them, like, as people, even. ðŸ˜‚
We now get perks like free meals or extra appetizers that basically make up the difference.
Treat people well that you want to treat you well. After all, if you're a regular you must like the food and service! Say thanks with a little extra :)

Bonus points if it's a smaller place like Mom and Pop, or has low turnover. Means more to them than Applebee's (but if Applebee's is your thing, do it there. You do you.)

Edit: For the surprising amount of haters, it's not complicated - go out of your way to be nice to people (in whatever way you can) and they will appreciate that and be nice to you. It's the basic empathy instinct. I am sure if I tossed a hundo every visit but was a complete asshat they wouldn't bother with any extras*. I feel sad for those folks who can't imagine having a place that might genuinely have nice people who you appreciate, and they appreciate you for being a steady, reliable, friendly face.  The most dead simple way to foster that is by tipping well when you get good service.

*The extras are incentive/loyalty programs that the owners/management have in place to foster good relationships with regular customers. They don't hand them out like candy to just any stranger off the street either though. No shady under the table dealings needed. You can find great places even in big cities if you look and are nice to people!
