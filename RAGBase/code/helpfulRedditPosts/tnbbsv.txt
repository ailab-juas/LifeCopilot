LPT: Use a sock to deal with that annoying extra detergent in the cap!

content:
It always bothered me to put the cap back on the bottle of detergent when there was still some on the sides, and rinsing it feels like wasting it. So I just use a sock that is going in the washer, wipe the inside, and toss it in the drum! The detergent is going to get used anyway, so might as well.
