title:
LPT - End of year raises - less than 5.4% is a pay CUT

content:
More of a PSA than LPT but wasn’t sure where else to put it.

Edit: the LPT is be aware of the inflation rate when discussing raises with your boss. It is a strong negotiation point. One your boss can’t argue.


For those of you who have stayed with the same company through this pandemic or even just for the past year. End of year is fast approaching and it’s time for performance reviews &amp; raises.

The inflation rate this year is 5.6%. This is very important for those of you working in corporations that like to put out flat 2% raises or cap raises at 3-4%. Companies adjust their prices regularly to account for inflation and should adjust pay as well but it’s not in their interest to do so. Many will try to use excuses that “be happy you got a whole 3% that’s more than most/I even got” or even “you got a whole 4% RAISE. That’s huge.”

But the fact is 5.4% is just to maintain. If you get less than a 5.4% raise you are getting a pay CUT and if you get a 5.4% “raise” they are just paying you the same as before. Your company may be struggling or needing to cut back and unable to give you more. But you do need to be aware that even if they are giving you a token “raise” it is a pay cut.

The practice of giving/accepting 2% flat raises is why people find coworkers getting hired for more than them after a few years. It’s because you have been accepting pay cuts every year.

Edit: my apologies the data I looked at didn’t was a month out of date the inflation rate is actually 6.2% as of October.

This is for US. Every country has its own inflation rates and rules around it.
