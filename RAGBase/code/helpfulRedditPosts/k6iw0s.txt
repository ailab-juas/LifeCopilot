title:
YSK that there is a simplified English version of Wikipedia.

content:
 [https://simple.wikipedia.org](https://simple.wikipedia.org/) is the link.

Why YSK: This has a load of articles, described in much simpler terms, making it way easier to understand a topic, for instance [Thermocouple on the Simple page](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple) vs [Thermocouple on the regular page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple). This is a great revision tool for many topics.
