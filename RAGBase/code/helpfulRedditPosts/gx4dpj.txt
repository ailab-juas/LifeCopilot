LPT: Sometimes "thank you" is better than "sorry".

content:
If you're going through a hard time and someone is supporting you and helping you through it, it's probably not your fault, so instead of saying something like "I'm sorry you have to look after me like this" it's better to say "thank you for caring."
It will help you to stay more positive about whatever it is you're going through because you'll remind yourself there are people who care about you. You'll also show the person appreciation rather than regret, which is more positive for them and you.
