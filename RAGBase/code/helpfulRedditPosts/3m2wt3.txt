LPT: Create a contact in your phone named "Car" and fill in it's information in the "Notes" section

Create a contact in your phone called either "Car" or whatever your Make and Model is.  I used "Hyundai Veloster" because that's what I drive.

On Android (I assume iOS has something similar), all the way at the bottom of the Contact's info, there is a section for "Notes".  I use that space to enter all the information I may need at a moment's notice for my car.  

I have a terrible memory and will likely not remember my license plate, or what type of oil my car takes, or my VIN, etc.  **This really helps me if I have a headlight go out and need to get one at the store on the way home, or any number of scenarios where this information may not be readily available otherwise.**

Here's a quick template that you can modify as needed:

VIN:

PLATE:

HEADLIGHT:

BRAKELIGHT:

OIL TYPE:

OIL AMOUNT:

OIL INTERVAL:

TIRE SIZE:

TIRE PSI:

WIPER (FRONT, DRIVER)

WIPER (FRONT, PASS.):

It may seem a little silly, but it's definitely helped me before.

**EDIT:**  Several people have pointed out that there are other, perhaps more effective, methods of keeping this information handy.  Use whatever works best for you.  People so far have mentioned [**Google Keep**](http://www.google.com/keep/), [**Evernote**](https://evernote.com/), and [**OneNote**](https://www.onenote.com/).
