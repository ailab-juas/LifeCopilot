YSK that food delivery companies not only charge DELIVERY fees, but that also inflate menu prices and charge service fees, min cart fees, and more. On avg, $35 in food cost winds up costing over $55 on US delivery apps!

Why YSK: You can save money by being more informed about food delivery fees. Those ads you see all the time for “free delivery” really mean “no delivery fee.” There’s also 15-20% service fees, they inflate menu prices, and add surge fees and minimum cart fees. Sales taxes are also calculated differently from app to app! One item that’s $10 on the menu could very well be $17 on a delivery app. I usually avoid these fees by either 1. Picking up the food myself or 2. Using a food delivery aggregator like FoodBoss or MealMe. [Foodboss](https://www.foodboss.net/) has a website, but only operates in a few cities and compares 2 major services. [MealMe](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mealme-doordash-grubhub-etc/id1460140965) works in every city and compares all the apps, but is only on iOS. Whatever you choose, make sure to always tip!
