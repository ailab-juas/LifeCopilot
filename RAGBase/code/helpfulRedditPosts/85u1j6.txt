title:
YSK that if you bought a PS3 from an authorized retailer, you have a month to claim a $65 refund

content:
From the article: *It's due to a class action lawsuit involving a security update. The original PlayStation 3 had the option for an alternate operating system, but the slim version of the console released later removed that feature as part of a security update. This resulted in a class action lawsuit which was settled in 2016. It allows owners of the original PlayStation 3 to claim a $65 payout by submitting a claim form.*

*You can submit a claim form [here](http://www.otherossettlement.com/poc.php).*

*To be eligible, you must have purchased the console from an authorized retailer, provide your PlayStation username and the serial number of your system. The deadline for submitting a claim is April 15*
