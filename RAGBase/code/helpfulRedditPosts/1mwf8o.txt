LPT: You *can* freeze guacamole (one time) and hardly tell the difference. If you live in a place where perfectly ripe avocados are hard to find.

I'm in Japan and run a bar where we serve Mexican food.  But it's a pain to find avocados of the correct ripeness here.  We used to throw away so much guacamole, as it browns so quickly.  Then, we discovered we could make a big batch when we had ripe avocados, dob it out on sheets of saran wrap in individual servings, then freeze these.  When ready to use, its 20 seconds in the micro-wave to thaw.  Side-by-side comparison with fresh showed there was no loss in quality!
