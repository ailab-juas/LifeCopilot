title:
LPT: for easy Lego cleanup use a bed-sheet

content:
if your kids (or you!) like to spread the Lego out on the floor to find the piece they want just spread out a bed-sheet on the floor and tip the box out onto it. it's a lot more fun than trying to keep all the pieces in the box and at the end of the day just pick up the corners/sides of the sheet for easy cleanup! either put everything, sheet and all into the box or use the sheet to "pour" the Lego back into the box! no more stepping on Lego!

EDIT:
I know there are products out there with drawstrings etc.. but THIS IS FREE!
