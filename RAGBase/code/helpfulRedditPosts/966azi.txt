LPT: An agrument is when you are trying to determine WHO is right, a conversation is when you are trying to determine WHAT is right.

content:
In the business world we should all be having conversations, however in my experience this is very rarely the case, mostly it is arguments. So how do you change this? The first step is to point out the above. Ultimately this entire situation is caused by the ego, a universal variable most managers never take into account. Try to separate yourself from your idea and present it in a way that is purely beneficial to the company, if you do this enough times your ego will eventually be rewarded.

Edit: Agrument...I know...believe me when I say it is irritating me more than it could possibly irritate you :)
