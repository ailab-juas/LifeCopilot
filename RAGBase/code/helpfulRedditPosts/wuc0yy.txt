LPT: If your cashier/server/etc. looks like they’re upset, don’t ask if they’re ok- especially if there’s a line

You’re not a jerk for doing this; It’s often a reflex for good people. However, that question makes it really hard to not cry and service job logistics don’t allow for that kind of conversation.   

Personally, something I would sincerely appreciate is a comment along the lines of ‘sorry if today isn’t treating you well’ with a couple bucks in the tip jar. Inflation while working a shitty paying service job is what’s making me cry these days….
