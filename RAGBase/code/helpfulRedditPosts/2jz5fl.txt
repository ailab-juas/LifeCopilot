LPT: When seeking a second opinion, don't mention the first diagnosis. You'll get a more thorough workup vs a confirmation.

This is a great medical system hack.

I have a family full of medical professionals, and this is one piece of advice they follow. A true second opinion is supposed to be a complete examination from scratch to search for what may be missed or to gain new perspective, but in today's world of overlapping appointments it is often just a quick confirmation.

* Often a doctor is reluctant to counter another's diagnosis
* If they think it is already resolved the don't look as hard
* Second opinions are often seen by doctors as a quest for reassurance by the patient
* doctors often react negatively to patients they perceive as questioning their profession's competence

I was facing an amputation once, saw multiple doctors, same result. Went to another without telling him what I'd been told, a small overlooked detail allowed for a simpler treatment, and I kept the leg.

**EDIT: I am not recommending having all tests repeated. just take the test results with you**
