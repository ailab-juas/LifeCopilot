LPT: If you’re going trick or treating, be respectful of your neighbors who leave signs telling you not to knock or ring their doorbell. They left their sign there for a reason.

Some people don’t want to be disturbed. 


Some people don’t celebrate Halloween because of their religion. 


Some people want to tuck in their 8 month old to bed and make sure they stay asleep. 


Some people have dogs that will get riled up enough to constantly bark at the sound of a doorbell or at the sight of kids approaching the door. Nobody wants to deal with all night barking and noise complaints from the neighbors.



There’s a multitude of reasons why they don’t want a knock on their door. Please be respectful of your neighbors when they leave signs telling them not to knock.
