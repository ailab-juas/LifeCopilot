 tl;dr

* When sirens go off, stop and find shelter. No driving to your parents house, no amateur storm chasing.


 * If indoors, watch the weather station and prepare a shelter in a central and enclosed room. Bathtub with a heavy blanket on top is good. Basement is best. Grab a flashlight and battery radio.


 * If outside and you suspect tornado, go to nearest building. If none, or if you see a tornado, get out of the car, and into a ditch.


 * Yes, bridges are bad. Overpasses are worse. Lying flat on open ground is actually better. It goes against instinct, but is backed up by the gov: http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=safety-overpass

Being from Oklahoma I figured I would post this for those that don't know. First and foremost respect mother nature she is a vengeful yet beautiful mistress.

Now when you hear the sirens look for immediate cover. Don't freak out that the most important thing. You need to stay calm and collected. Remember it isn't the end of the world. It may seem like it but I assure you it isn't. Been thru the May 3rd 1999 tornado myself and countless others. 

Now sure signs there is a tornado in your immediate area. The sky will usually turn a greenish color. You will feel the air being pulled from your nose and mouth. It isn't suffocating or anything just a weird sensation.

You may also feel warm air near your head being pulled away and cold air being pushed past your feet. That means its really close. Now you can also see the clouds swirling overhead. While an amazing sight its is a sign to get to cover.

Now when looking for a place to wait out the storm you want to be in the center of a structure (house) with walls around three sides of you. Closet is a good bet or bathroom. Try to get a mattress or blanket over top of you. It will give you some protection against flying debris. 

The worse part of a tornado is the things that fly around. Seen it drive bits of hay thru rail road beams. Also seen one carry a jar of pickles 12 miles and not scratch the label. The winds of a tornado are no joke. It will wrap a car around a tree like a pretzel.

Don't underestimate its power. Seeing it on TV is an entirely different perspective then being there. Others can vouch for this. Now if you see one off in the distance and its getting bigger that means it is getting closer. You need to act fast they will move about 25 to 60 miles per hour on the ground. 

That is really fast trust me. **DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CHASE A TORNADO** you leave that shit to them professionals they been doing it for a while. Its better to let them go after it. **IF YOU ARE IN YOUR CAR AND A TORNADO IS COMING GET INTO A DITCH IF POSSIBLE.**  The twister will pick you car up and throw it into another county if it feels like it.

Air bags won't protect you. **DO NOT HIDE UNDER A BRIDGE** it can pick the bridge up sometimes and say peek a boo right in your face after it throws a semi at you. 

Now the good bits. There is no cleaner air after a tornado comes thru. Won't need a claritin for a while trust me. Oh best bit of advise is don't go to an area where there was a tornado. Those people have their underwear hanging off the mailbox last thing they want is you or much less CNN taking pics of all their life scattered on the lawn. 

Its rude and very very intrusive. I been there and even if you do want to help their are other ways. Go to a FEMA location or red cross and ask how you can help. They will tell you. 

Be safe around this time of year everyone.

Edit wanted to say thank you for so many that are covering points that I have missed. Please everyone read the comments.
