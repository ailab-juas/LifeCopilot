YSK if you suffer from panic attacks, anxiety attacks or even have trouble sleeping, this breathing technique could really help.

I'm sure a lot of you are aware of this, but for those who aren't, this could really help. It helps me when I have anxiety, anxiety attacks or panic attacks. It's a simple one, just breath in deeply through your nose for 7 seconds, hold it in for 5 seconds, then exhale for another 5-7 seconds, and then repeat this 3 times. It resets your breathing, lowers your breathing rate, and generally calms you. Panic attacks are often brought on by irregular and quick breaths, so resetting your breathing and slowing it down increases oxygen intake and relaxes you. Hope it helps for those who don't know in future :-)
