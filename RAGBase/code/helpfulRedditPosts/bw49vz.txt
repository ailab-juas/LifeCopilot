YSK:. A lot of restaurants charge SEAMLESS more for menu items + have higher fees than other delivery platforms which is passed onto the consumer.

I was about to order donuts from my usual takeout spot in Manhattan when I noticed an increase in service fees. Decided to check out Delivery.com to see if there was any difference in fees when. The fee was 2$ lower + the individual menu items were lower overall, too. Dug around more and read some terrible things about their biz practices in general.
