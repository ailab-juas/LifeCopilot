YSK if you use any app based service, tipping cash is far better than tipping "in app" or online

content:
So short sweet and to the point. This goes for any food delivery (DoorDash, postmates) as well as ride sharing. 

Please tip cash for a few reasons

A: They get the money. Postmates, Uber (Eats and ride share) and Lyft have been caught stealing several times.

B: They get the money FASTER. All services have a fast pay option but it costs, so tipping in cash lets them get lunch or gas without having to cash out as often. Also Postmates can take up to 24 hours to give the driver your tip and Uber takes up to five.

C: In case of DoorDash, tips go further. Dashers get a gaurentee for delivery. If your tip plus base pay isnt high enough, DoorDash gives them more. If you tip cash, they get both. So your tip goes further. 

D: Taxes. Cash tips are between the driver and God. And God takes less than Uncle Sam.

So basically in app tips can be stolen, take longer and not go as far to helping your driver stay on the road and that means your food takes longer/less chance your uber or lyft has a free water bottle for ya.

Edit: A LOT of you are stuck on the taxes issue. Point D was a joke. Most drivers dont pay taxes once they do their deductions. So if youre sitting there thinking me trying to stiff Uncle Sam is a valid point for you to ignore this, undertstand that me and him are good. I took him all my stuff and at first he was like "you owe me money man," and I was like, "Check these deductions" and he was like "Aw shit, son, we square."

Also edit becuase some formatting issues.

Edit 2: Thanks for the plat anon

Edit 3: And gold too
