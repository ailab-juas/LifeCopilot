LPT: If you're taking your animal to the vet for an ailment, get video of them coughing, breathing strangely, limping, etc. Animals may not show the ailment at the vet's office and the video can help the vet diagnose your furry friend.

It also can save you multiple trips to the vet.

Edit: Was not expecting this to blow up this much! I do need to give credit to my own vet for suggesting I do this when I brought my cat in and he wouldn't cough and hack like I was claiming he was doing... jerk...

Also, a lot of people recommend to record illness episodes to show Dr's and a lot of other suggestions for warranties and such.

And, of course, thanks for the gold and silver, internet strangers!
