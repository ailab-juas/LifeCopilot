LPT: if you work a salaried position that pays $X for a 40 hour week, but you work 50 hours, then your pay is actually $X - 20%. Keep this in mind when comparing positions and salaries.

I used to work a job that I thought paid really well. It was a salaried position where I was paid for 40 hours a week but usually worked 55 hours.

Now in my new job where Iâ€™m doing the exact same role just for a different company, my take home pay is slightly less each week, but I usually only work 38 hours a week.

In this new job my hourly rate is actually much higher than it was previously.
