LPT for cashiers: When people give you cash put the money on the counter near you.

content:
Customer claim they gave you a $50 when they actually gave you a $20?   To avoid this in the future when the customer hands you money put it on the counter in front of you, not in your drawer.  Now give the customer their change, if they question the transaction their money is still on the counter for proof.  LPT from your friendly Trader Joeâ€™s.
