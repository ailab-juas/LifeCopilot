LPT: Guys, if you want to kiss a girl, just ask her first.

content:
I can't tell you how many awkward or embarrassing moments this will save you. Often times it's hard to tell if she is interested or not. A quick "Can I kiss you?" Is victimless and painless. If she says "No" you can just say "Ok thanks" and quickly return to the conversation or step away much easier than having that weird moment of standing there embarrassed not knowing what to do, and she will almost always thank you for asking and feel less intimidated to continue to be around you.

Edit. Obviously don't got around asking every girl you talk to to kiss you. This involves making sure there is a vibe and reading the situation first.

Edit 2. After reading and responding to comments on here I've realized consent is a strange and foreign concept to many people on Reddit.

Edit 3. Clearly this is a subjective conversation. Nobody is right or wrong. Appreciate all your input.
