YSK: If you’re at a zoo and you see an animal in distress(ie a tortoise on a back) contact a staff member!

Hello! I’m a zookeeper and I keep seeing alarming videos with the public “helping” the animals. 

Why ysk: we are trained to handle these animals. All zoo staff, regardless of position, have radios we use all the time to communicate. The video I saw a was a man who had grabbed a tree branch to flip a tortoise back over. NO. The public should never touch the animals unless it’s a petting zoo type of enclosure. You could do more damage than good, and you’re teaching others it’s okay. It’s not. 

Also why we are here, don’t feed the animals either. I can assure you they most likely eat better than you. There’s always a surplus of food left over. These diets are made specifically with that species in mind. We have a farm type petting zoo enclosure with signs that say don’t feed the animals, but you may pet them. But people do. You don’t know if what you’re feeding them is toxic, has been sprayed with chemicals, or has bacteria on it. 

You wouldn’t want someone feeding your dog chocolate or touching it without permission; zoos are no exception. Please be respectful.
