YSK that drowning is most often silent and unnoticeable.

The thrashing and screaming you see in the movies? Usually doesn't happen.

I speak from personal experience. When your number one goal is to get some sweet, sweet oxygen, you forget about useless activities like "yelling for help". Your mouth only resurfaces for a second, and nobody's wasting that second on communication.

Drowning is often unnoticeable. There may even be three or more people, like, a few meters away, and nobody may notice you struggling for your life.

So if you have a child, keep an eye out at all times. Online sources check out, too: A 9-year-old nearly drowned 10 feet from her parents, and she only screamed "Daddy!" after she was rescued by someone else with experience.

tl;dr movies incorrectly portray drowning.
