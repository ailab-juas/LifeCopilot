LPT: If you want to see if someone you care about is awake, gently say "I love you" instead of "Are you still awake?"

content:
My son has always hated falling asleep. I would sit with him and like every frustrated parent, when I would get up from my chair, he would reach out and say "Where are you going mom? Stay here." So instead of saying "Are you awake?" before getting up (which invariably always wakes someone up it seems); I started saying "I love you." In doing that I noticed a few things. (a) If my son was awake, he was comforted and usually went to sleep within minutes of me saying this (b) The response back was always, "I love you too mom" which would leave us both in a great mood for going to bed and (c) if there was no response, I knew I was safe to get up. I do this with my husband too and the affect seems to be the same.
