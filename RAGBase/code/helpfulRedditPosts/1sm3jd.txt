LPT: How to make sex better while wearing a condom

content:
When you are about to have sex, put a drop of water based lubricant into the top of the inside of the condom. Then put the condom on and squeeze the remaining air left. Now you are ready to have some fun! The lube in the top of the condom will give a pleasant and natural sensation for the wearer during sex. Enjoy! 

**Edit**. Just a few general things from what I have read in the comments. 1. If you use **WATER** based lubricant the condom won't break. 2. If you only use a drop it won't slide off and you will still feel the good effects. 3. I understand there are other kinds of condoms out there that are thinner and supposed to give you more sensation and I have used those, however, I still find that this trick has helped me out no matter what kind of condom I am using.
