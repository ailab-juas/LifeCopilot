YSK sites like the Weather Channel, Weather Underground, etc. all get their data from the US National Weather Service (weather.gov)

The main difference between the most accurate predictor (weather.gov) and the commercial sites is that the latter overpredicts inclement weather. Their thinking is that if you plan a picnic because there's a low chance of rain but get rained on, you'll be more upset than if they predicted rain but it turns out to be a nice day.
