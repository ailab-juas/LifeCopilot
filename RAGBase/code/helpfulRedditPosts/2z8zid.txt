YSK: If you use TurboTax and select 'Pay with refund option', they will discretely add an addition $29.99 fee.

I helped a friend finish his taxes. He was using turbo tax. The Federal return was free but the state return came to $27.99.  He wanted to pay the $27.99 fee with his refund, so I selected the option. When I was reading the agreement form I noticed the total fee added to $57.98.  Thinking I made a mistake I went back and tried to figure It out. Turns out if you select the 'Pay with your refund' option, you have to purchase their service. So watch out!
