LPT: If you experience mid-morning energy crashes (fatigue, brain fog, body feels heavy, etc), stop eating cereal for breakfast

content:
I switched to eating proteins for breakfast (eggs, cheesestick wrapped with lunch meat, etc.), and it was life changing. I used to eat cereal or some other form of carbohydrate (muffin, toast, etc) every morning and would feel awful around 9:30 or 10am. I later took a class in nutritional physiology and learned about how your body's insulin response can overcompensate for your sugar intake, then resulting in low blood sugar a few hours later. 

I know this doesn't happen for everyone, but it did for me, and it was significantly life altering when I switched!

Edit: Ok, I'm surprised at how many of you are offended at my cheese/lunchmeat go-to breakfast item LOL. I know it might not be the best or freshest or most organic or healthiest source of cheese/protein but it's cheap and I'm poor and in graduate school. Calm down lol. If you have money to buy the good cheese and meat more power to you- most people do not.

Edit: Wow, definitely wasn't expecting this much of a response! Thanks for all the awesome comments/advice/suggestions- I do enjoy talking nutrition! I do want to emphasize that while I do have training in nutritional physiology, I am not a certified nutritionist. But I am honored that so many of you are reaching out for advice. :) I simply wanted to share something that really helped me out in a way that was practical for most people to utilize in their lives. I will try to reply to as many of you as I can- but, it is Friday afternoon... so I will likely be indulging in some carbohydrate rich alcoholic beverages here soon. ;) Wishing you all the best!
