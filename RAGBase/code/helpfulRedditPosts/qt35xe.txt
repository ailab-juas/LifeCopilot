LPT: Take your random vacation days on Mondays, not Fridays

content:
Fridays are special on their own, everyone tends to be in a better mood and it almost feels like the weekend has started. Monday's, however, suck.

By taking Monday off, you can enjoy your weekend more and have a shorter week to look forward to.
