LPT: If your job is hiring, check their job postings to see if they are offering a higher starting salary for your position/similar positions.

content:
Sometimes jobs will offer higher pay because no one is applying, but won't give out raises to current employees to match that. 


Also, if they have a pay range listed, you may qualify for a higher pay in that range.
