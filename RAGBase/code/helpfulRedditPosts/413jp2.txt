YSK debt collectors can't call reassigned numbers under fcc 15-72. This includes texts.

So basically if you are getting annoying collections calls for someone that isn't you, the collection agency is in violation of this rule.


They have the leeway of being asked to remove the number once. If they don't remove the number after being asked every call after is a violation. If you record the calls you could lead to the company facing huge fines via a forfeiture order. 


Here is an example of this.
