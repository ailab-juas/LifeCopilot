YSK: You don't need to point your phone screen at the PIN pad when using it to pay for things.

Why YSK: Tap-to-pay is wireless, so pointing the screen away from you means you can't tell what your phone is doing. I've seen a lot of people of varying ages are still not used to NFC (near field communication) technology and wanted to clarify something.

Also YSK: After you tap, you don't have to hold it there like it's a chip card. When you get a confirmation chime, it means it's done, you can put your card or phone away.
