LPT: If you're in college, ask the professor at the beginning of the semester if you can buy the previous edition of the required textbook instead of the current one.

content:
I never had a professor deny me this, they all said that it would be fine for me to use the previous edition. These editions usually sell for $10-20 on eBay. I never paid more than $100 per semester on textbooks. Even if a professor says no, it's still worth it to just ask.
