YSK: Air Fryers are just small convection ovens

content:
Why YSK: You might want to purchase an air fryer for yourself or as a gift to open up new cooking opportunities, without realizing that you may already be able to do the same thing with cooking instruments you already have.

Air fryers popped up as a "hot new" kitchen gadget a few years ago, but their cooking mechanism is something that has already existed for a long time.  It's called "convection cooking" and involves heating the air and also using a fan to circulate the air inside the cooking cooking area, which gets more heat to the surface of food and tends to make things more crispy than standard, still-air baking.

Before buying an air-fryer, check if your oven has a "convection" setting.  If it does, you can use that setting to get the same results as using an air fryer.  If you have a [countertop toaster oven](https://imgur.com/AIOzuU1.jpg), check this as well since many of them also have a convection setting.  Either of these options will provide a higher capacity than most air fryers.

If you don't have a kitchen device that does convection cooking, and want to air fry, you may also consider getting a convection toaster oven instead of an air fryer, since it is more versatile and has a larger capacity (though also a larger footprint and usually more expensive).
