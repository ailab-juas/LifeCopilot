YSK: Why do all airplanes still have ashtrays in the lavatories, even though smoking is not allowed.

Why YSK: Despite the ban on smoking on all airlines in the world, there are still people who break the law and smoke in the lavatories and even in airplane cabin. Ashtrays made for these people, so that the smoker put out the cigarette exactly there and did not throw it in the trash garbage can in which the paper can catch fire. Of course, smoke detectors identify the offender, but the most important thing is not to create a threat of fire. 

**Do not smoke in the airplane!** No matter how hard you try it will still be detected, and if you cause a fire and there is a direct threat to the safety of the entire plane, you will go to jail for a long time and will be blacklisted and not allowed to fly.
