title:
YSK That there is a Youtuber called "Dad, how do I?" that explains everyday things that might need a father-figure to help you with. His Dad walked out on him when he was 12, he makes maintenance vides for people with no Dad.

content:
It's just basic stuff but I know friends of mine that have watched his videos in the last couple of weeks and it has made a real positive difference to their life. He does videos from how to tie a tie to even how to check your car's oil. Very helpful stuff that everyone who doesn't have a dad or just wants some DIY tips should know.
