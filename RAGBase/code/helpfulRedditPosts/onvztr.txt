LPT: Always debrief. After a relationship, major work project, basically any big event in your life, take some time to explore what went right, what went wrong and why. Actively doing this is your best chance of avoiding repeating the mistake, but you’ll also make better decisions in the future.

Repeated mistakes and other future mistakes can often be avoided by looking back and actively recording and breaking down what just happened and your part in it.

I’ve worked in lots of industries, and on relatively large projects it amazes me how the euphoria of completing something means the majority of people just want to go straight into the next thing. And the same problems and mistakes repeat.

Or I hear “That was awful, I never want to think about that again” This is often dooming you to repeat it.

Your emotions distort facts, and every ‘logical’ decision still has an emotional component and bias. 

You have to write it down. Or use some tool/app to visualise it, break it down to see it clearly.

Just saying to yourself “I won’t do that again” is frankly useless. Because even a small input can have domino affect that you might be unaware of. Or the problem is coming from a partner, co worker, family member and it’s nothing you are doing. Your memory doesn’t remember everything accurately.

The bigger the event, the more time you should spend. 

This is not a waste time, wasting time is repeating the same mistakes.
