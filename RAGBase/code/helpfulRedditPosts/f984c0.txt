LPT: Debt, in almost ALL cases, can not be passed on through death. If someone calls you to pay the debt of a recently passed relative, hang up. In many states and countries this practice is illegal but debt collectors will try and scare you into paying anyway.

To add, if you can't find lawyers in your area, just google the case with your state/country name. Many cases have already been filed and are published online, so you can see for yourself whether you actually need to pay or not. If you talk with them any further, or even mention that you may pay or give the impression you are considering to pay - they may and will use this later to argue you told them you would accept ownership of the debt. These guys are predatory and will not stop easily. And they specifically come during the grieving times because they know you are more likely to pay or take on the debt since you're in a  vulnerable place. They will try and convince you to take out a monthly payment plan where the payments are so small you won't even notice it, but then they'll add interest and increase payments in a few months - which will be in the small print that they won't give to you.
