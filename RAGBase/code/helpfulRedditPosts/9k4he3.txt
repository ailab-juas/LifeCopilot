Attention, notification squad!

Thank you for coming here. As the OP of this post, I welcome you to this comment thread. May we live together in peace, toward a vision of mutual prosperity. In this ever-changing world we live in, we stand at the threshold of grand opportunities, but also great hurdles. The systems in place send us arbitrary notifications for mediocre, lackluster posts. This will test our fortitude. It will challenge our resilience. We may bend, but we must not break.

Why, you might ask, have you been sent here, to the noble shores of comment 49k4he3? Why aren't you assigned to some explosive PhotoshopBattle, a worldnews meta thread, or at least a HQG shitpost? I cannot say. But now that we are here, together, in this comment thread, it behooves us to coexist in peace and harmony. To forge a path forward. To elevate this comment thread and improve the wellbeing of all its citizens. 

Thank you very much, and God bless 9k4he3.
