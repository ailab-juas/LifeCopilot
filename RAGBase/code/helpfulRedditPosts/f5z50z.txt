YSK spiders are attracted to humidity, hence why they’re often found in bathrooms - the most humid room in the house. But they’re also attracted to airflow, so if you find a spider you don’t want to deal with, open a window and close the door for an hour or so, it will likely let itself out.

I learned all this at a spider phobia course last year, which I went to because my phobia was very extreme. These facts were helpful to my peace of mind (know you’re enemy type thing). The course resulted in me getting rid of my phobia, but for those who have one still, I hope this helps.
