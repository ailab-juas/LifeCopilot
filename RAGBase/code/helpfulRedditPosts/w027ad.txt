LPT: When you're in a situation where you must be effective &amp; eloquent with your words, SLOW DOWN. The slower you talk, the more confident &amp; smooth you sound. Your mind will have more time to keep up with your words as you speak. It makes a giant difference of the impact you have on the listener

content:
Smooth people speak slowly. Nervous or insecure people tend to speak faster, thus, increasing the chance of making a spoken mistake or saying "too much". Powerful &amp; smooth people don't speak fast at all. They think deeply about every word that comes out of their mouth
