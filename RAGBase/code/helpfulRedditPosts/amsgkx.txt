title:
YSK that your tax service may charge you ADDITIONAL fees to pay for the US fed/state filing of your returns using your federal refund (in lieu of paying via an alternative method, such as your credit card, which costs you nothing).

content:
The service often cleverly disguises these fees. For instance, let's say that the service charges you $30.00 to file your federal return and $30.00 to file your state return. They'll offer you two options:

* Pay via credit card; or
* Pay using funds which will be subtracted from your federal return.

They'll present the "using your federal return" option as merely being a more convenient alternative payment method and that your decision really doesn't bear any consequences. "No need to get up to get your wallet, we'll just subtract the **$30.00 fee from your federal return**!" or something along those lines. 

Read the statement (and the subsequent required federal notice) carefully, though. They're charging you a ***fee*** of $30.00 to file your federal return for $30.00 and your state return for $30.00, for a ***total of $90.00***. I find this to be deceptive. 

If you pay with your card, no such fee will be incurred; you'll need only to pay the $60.00 in filing fees. 

I hope that this helps someone, because I just about fell for it.
