[LPT] touchscreens work inside of ziplock bags, it's a cheap waterproof case

content:
I use this in two scenarios, when boating to protect my phone but still allow me to use it and also when working on my car, I can have a PDF manual pulled up on my tablet and not have to worry about getting grease on it.

Edit: as u/franticwifey mentioned do not do intensive activities on the phone while it is in the bag because cooling can be an issue if your phone is working hard or in the bag or an extended period of time.
