LPT When shopping for a new printer, don't look for the cheapest machine, looks for the cheapest cartridges, ebay has lots of cloned cartridges that makes running your printer super cheap.

I've found I end up on craigslist buying a second hand printer that takes the cloned cartridges, costing me only a few bucks. My office printer gets rinsed pretty hard so I need it to be cost effective.
