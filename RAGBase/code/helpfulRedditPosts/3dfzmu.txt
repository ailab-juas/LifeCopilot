YSK that if you are depressed or suffer from any other mental illness, your doctor or psychiatrist can actually right a prescription for a therapy pet. Sometimes, the prescription can even override a "no pets" policy in an apartment coimplex.

Cannot confirm with anything other than anecdotal experience.  I went through Intensive Outpatient therapy a few weeks the doctor there advised one of the patients to ask about writing a prescription for a therapy animal.
