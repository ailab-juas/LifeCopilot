LPT: Take power naps. Even 10 mins can make you much more refreshed and alert during difficult times. In fact, in general they save you much more time than they take.

I speak from years of experience working in Japan. 
It is part of the culture here, but ho lee shit does it work.if I'm nodding off in a meeting, even 5-10 mins before the next one starts makes me survive and perform. Get on it.

Edit:
First of all, thanks for the awards, you legends!

Second, for all the people saying "I can't fall asleep that fast", all I could possibly say is that this doesn't apply to you. Either you are not tired enough to need it, or its a ymmv type of thing. From my perspective, and a cultural one, it isn't about falling asleep, its about not being able to stay awake. Cheers
