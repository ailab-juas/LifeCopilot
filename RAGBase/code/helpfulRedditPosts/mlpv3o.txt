LPT - take yourself out for "dates" every so often when you are younger (early 20s or 30s), and don't rely on your phone for company. It feels weird the first time, but after facing the fear of being alone in public you'll be surprised about how much confidence you have in different situations.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the love! I honestly did not think that this post would gain so much traction. So just to provide a response to some of the comments I saw:

Yes, this can be done at any age. I put for younger people because when I was in my early twenties I needed for someone to tell me this. After college I move 800 miles away from home and everyone I knew and started new. I told some of my family I started going out to eat alone and they told me that was sad and I shouldn't do that but I honestly enjoyed it. (For background I grew up on a farm in a very small town. No one did anything alone and just going out in town you were bound to run into someone you knew) 

It seems like for people who grew up in the city this is common practice but for many this is unheard of. So if you are someone who needed to hear this I'm glad I could help.
