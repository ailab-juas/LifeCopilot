YSK If you want to share someone a Youtube video but want it to start from a particular timestamp, you can append &amp;t=&lt;time_in_seconds&gt; to the URL and the video will skip to exactly that timestamp when they'll open it.

Like if you're sharing a talk with someone but want the other person to look at something particular, you can add the timestamp to the URL. This AOA's kpop will start from 3:18 after appending &amp;t=198 to the URL.
