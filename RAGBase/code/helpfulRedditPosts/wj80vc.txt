title:
YSK You need to video/pics of all your belongings

content:


Why YSK: I'm a career Firefighter and I thought about this after one of my continuing Ed classes years ago. With the Cloud being in every hand nowadays...it's important to go room to room, shelf to shelf, drawer to drawer and take vids/pics of everything in your home. In the event of a fire, you have to itemize with the insurance company. Having an ACTUAL record of your belongings will help immensely!

I've known people who remembered lost items years later, and then it's too late. 

And if you rent, get a Renter's Policy! They're cheap! I've got a $40k policy that covers my belongings for just over $200 annual.

Edit: What really scared me when I thought of this was my library. I've got close to 1k novels I've read (and reference books). There was NO WAY I would remember them all to get replacements!

Edit 2: This also applies if you live in a possible flood zone or a tornado prone area!
