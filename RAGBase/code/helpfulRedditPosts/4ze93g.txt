LPT: Avoid the awkward "dancing" encounter with strangers by simply looking to the left or right and following through with that side.

content:
It happens to everyone. You're walking towards someone without much clearance on either side of them. You have to pick a side, but you don't want it to to be like high school prom. It's awkward, it sucks, but what I've started doing is if I know that this terrible encounter will happen, I simply look to the stranger's left or right and hold that stare. Lastly, pick a side, be confident in that side, and pursue it. Make the decision. Works like a charm. 

Edit 1: Woah I didn't think this was going to amount to anything like most things I do. I actually encountered this at my local University today with a stranger. After getting my sandwich, I went and sat with all my cool friends and started browsing LPT. 
After reading all the comments, I realize in most situations It's common courtesy to stay on the right. This LPT is more geared for sudden encounters and for people who don't enjoy the awkward tango.
