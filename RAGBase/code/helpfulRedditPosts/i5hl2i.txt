YSK: If you're a good listener, you might notice you have friends who dump their joys and sorrows on you at every possibly opportunity. It's not because they're looking for pity or want to be annoying, it's because they know you listen.

content:
Talking gives them some temporary relief from whatever emotions they may be experiencing, even if it doesn't seem like it, and you are the person they enjoy sharing those bits of information with. 

Challenge yourself to see the big picture and listen to their message as a whole, rather than undoubtedly being confused over every little detail that comes to mind for them.
