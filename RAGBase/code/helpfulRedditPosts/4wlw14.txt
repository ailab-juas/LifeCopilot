YSK these 8 Extremely Helpful Websites if You're Applying to College this Year

content:
Okay, so. You’re applying to college this year and you have **no idea** where to start. No worries, Reddit was a good place to come to. I’ve made a list of 8 websites that will provide you with *all the content you need this application season*. But this list won’t help you at all, unless **you do your part and commit**. So without further ado...

**1. [The Common App](http://www.commonapp.org/):** Obviously. But what isn't so obvious is this site's helpfulness beyond the "Apply Now" button. The site is *jam-packed* with videos answering tons of questions that have crossed every applicant's mind. If you don't find content that answers your questions - you can tweet to their highly responsive [virtual counselor](http://www.commonapp.org/virtual-counselor). Clicking literally anywhere else besides the "Apply Now" button can actually be extremely helpful - and it's something most applicants miss. 

**2. [The College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/):** Now look, I know the site may not be the prettiest on the *outside*, but I beg of you to give it a shot, and you will definitely change your mind. This site is absolutely golden if you're struggling to find universities which suit you. It has an easily accessible [database of statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/SurveyGroups.asp?group=2) to help guide you through the first stage of applying: choosing your university. And let me tell you, it really isn't always Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, or MIT - even though they may come to mind at first.

**3. [IvyApps](http://www.ivyapps.org):** Alright, alright. Let's say you're a big shot and want to apply to one of these top universities. One of the most helpful resources I found during the application process was a database of full applications and essays that were accepted from previous years. IvyApps has a database of over 20 full applications and over 60 essays accepted to top schools. [Here](http://ivyapps.org/essay-got-into-5-ivy-leagues/) is one of their essays which was accepted to **FIVE** Ivy League Universities. Reading essays isn’t for everyone, and if you think it isn’t for you, I still recommend you take 5 minutes out of your schedule to give it a shot! 
*Payment Warning*: Their other content does cost money to access (**$14**). 

**4.  [Federal Student Aid](https://fafsa.ed.gov/):** So as most Redditors know, US university is expensive. Like, [REALLY](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fees-and-room-and-board-over-time-1975-76-2015-16-selected-years) expensive. And since not all of us are heirs to cottages in Martha's Vineyard, we all have to find a way to save money. FAFSA is a really good website which can tell you what scholarships and aid you are eligible for. The first thing you should do, before you even put pen to paper and draft your essay, is sit down with your parents and have a talk about money. After the talk is over and they develop ulcers over tuition prices, show them FAFSA, and be their financial hero of the day. You may be surprised at how much financial aid you are eligible for.

**5. [Good 'Ol Sal Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat):** By now, everyone should recognize the soothing and supple voice of the one and only Sal Khan. I mean, he's probably the only reason why any of us got grades good enough to even be *eligible* for college. But it turns out Mr. Khan now teaches just a little more than algebra and economics; he's teamed up with the College Board to produce lessons specifically designed for the SAT. So sit back, relax, and press play as you learn how to ace the SAT. I highly recommend Khan Academy, and as I like to say: a video a day keeps the anxiety away!

**6. [CollegeExpress](http://www.collegexpress.com/):** It's all about the money. And beyond financial aid, it turns out you can save even more money - yeah you heard me - MORE. Just by having hobbies and being good at school. CollegeExpress has been the best search engine for scholarships in the USA that I have found so far. A little clacking of the keyboard and *voila!* Thousands of dollars at your fingertips. I really do recommend you check this out, because way too few people actually make use of the free money, all because they were too lazy to write a few hundred words. I can assure you that if you've survived high school you sure as hell can survive a few extra hours on the computer.

**7. [yconic.](https://yconic.com/):** Simply put - this is the Canadian version of CollegeExpress, but in my view, it is much more easy to navigate and use. The landing page says it all - over a hundred million dollars are available to you if you spend a few minutes on the site. Few minutes on site --&gt; few thousand in savings, now that is some return on investment a hedge fund manager would beg for.
*Side Note*: I'm literally not exaggerating when I say you only need to spend a few minuted on the computer - some of these scholarships only require you to put in your name and email. Now that's cool!

**8. [The College Board](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat?navId=gh-sat):** If you’ve made it all the way down my post - congratulations, you’ve earned the reward of the most stressful yet helpful website on the list. The College Board is the hub of *ALL* relevant standardized tests: from APs to SATs to SAT IIs (yes those exist). What I recommend you do on this website is the following: make a checklist for yourself. Research all the standardized tests they offer and make a list of all the ones you need. Add registration dates to your calendar, and if you haven’t done so already, **MAKE A CALENDAR**. You don’t know how many kids wait until the last minute to study or register - make this your first move in setting yourself apart.
