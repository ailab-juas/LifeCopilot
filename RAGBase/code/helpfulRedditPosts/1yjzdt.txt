title:
LPT: have a "spirited" dog that got loose and wants you to chase him/her? Hit the deck! Drop to the ground and pretend you're hurt.

content:
The dog will suddenly think something is wrong and approach you to try and help, and can then be usually much more easily caught and returned to safer confines.
