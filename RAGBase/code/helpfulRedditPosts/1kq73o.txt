LPT: Do not keep your checking/savings accounts with the same institution as your mortgage lender.

content:
If you get behind on your mortgage, the bank can legally withdraw from your checking and savings accounts without your knowledge or consent to cover the funds.  

Obviously, this is only important if you find yourself financially stressed. So if you should lose your job or are faced with large bills from another creditor (medical, etc.), you should immediately move your money to an institution that is unaffiliated with your mortgage bank.

Edit: For all of you saying "keep cash in reserves", and "LPT: Pay your mortgage" etc. I had 6 months cash reserve when I was laid off, which I made last 18 months.
