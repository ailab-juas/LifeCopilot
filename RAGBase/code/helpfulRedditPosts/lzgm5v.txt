LPT: If you're waiting for the bus at night, turn your turned on phone screen toward the bus as soon as you see it

content:
As a bus driver, it can be extremely difficult to see if someone is waiting at a bus stop when it's dark out.

Turning on your phone and pointing the screen towards the oncoming bus is a great way to make yourself more visible.

If you don't have a phone, another thing you can do is just move around a bit.  

Sometimes people will stand completely still, dressed in their black winter jacket and blue jeans and then wonder why the bus zoomed past them. 

Help out your driver by making yourself visible!
