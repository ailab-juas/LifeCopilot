LPT When asking if someone wants to go on a date, don't just ask them "out". Think of an activity you would want to do on your own. Then ask if the person wants to join you for it.

content:
You don't have to "be confident" or fake it til you make it" then. You can instead show that you have your own interests and have something to offer in terms of fun or weirdness :) 

This also puts less pressure on the person to make up their mind about whether they like you or not when all they have to decide is whether they like the idea of the activity.

If they say yes, they either like you or they like the activity enough to spend time with you. It'll be a lower stakes date giving them time to get to know you. 

If they say no, they either don't like you or don't like what you like, meaning that they were never going to be a good fit.
