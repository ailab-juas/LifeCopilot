YSK that the vagina is self cleaning, but the vulva is NOT.

content:
While many people use the term "vagina" to name the inside and outside of women's genitals, the correct name for the outside of your genitals is called vulva, and that's NOT self cleaning.

You need to wash it daily with water and a mild soap if you want to avoid swamp ass.
