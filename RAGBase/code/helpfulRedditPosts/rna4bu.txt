LPT: If you live in a cold apartment buy a heated blanket not a space heater. It will save you so much energy!

content:
I was recently introduced to a heated blanket as a gift and I realized that it is only around 80 w and can get me uncomfortably warm at full power. Just some quick napkin math here but let's say you use this blanket for 6 hours a day when you're not at work, even at full power it would only cost $0.07 a day, assuming you were paying around 15 cents per kilowatt hour. Compare that to a 1200 watt space heater running a 70% duty cycle which would cost $0.76 a day. Now granted an extra $20 a month isn't insane savings but it can get you a Spotify and Netflix subscription.

It also gives you a good excuse to cuddle up with your partner / wife's boyfriend.
