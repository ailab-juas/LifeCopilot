YSK The difference between hoarding and preparing. Hoarding is reactionary and causes shortages, being prepared ahead of time actually reduces shortages.

Leaders of various countries have maintained preparedness websites for many years now.

Among other things, it's recommended to have extra food, keep track of medications so you don't run out, and make an emergency plan in case something happens to your house.

"Flattening the curve" applies to more than just healthcare (although it's the most urgent right now). Preparing ahead of time reduces the strain on retail stores. It also puts you in a better spot to help those around you.

I'm not saying fill a bunker with MREs. That might be against the law in some places. You know what will work best based on your budget, space available, and possible emergencies.

Edit: This post isn't meant to gloat, or shame people who are buying what they need now. Prepper forums are blowing up with people saying "I told you so" like the world is going to end and they were right all along. Essential items are still being produced, and this crisis will pass like others before it. *In the future* you can take advice from your own government and experts to be more prepared.

EditÂ²: A lot of all-or-nothing comments here. Look at your pantry. Do you have enough for a week? Two weeks? What would happen if you couldn't go to the store? This is more about being aware of what you have/don't have than it is maxing your credit card for canned wheat.
