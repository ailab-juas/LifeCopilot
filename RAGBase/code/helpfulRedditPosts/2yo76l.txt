LPT: College students, attend your professor's office hours and ask for letters of recommendation at the end of the semester.

I attended college after graduating from high school. I was a good student, but I never went to my professor's office hours even when I had legitimate questions about the material covered in class. I was intimidated by the thought of talking to a professor who might think my questions to be stupid.

Fast forward 15 years to when I went back to college to get a second degre in engineering. After spending those 15 years in the professional world, I learned a lot about dealing and communicating with other adults. I decided to start attending my professor's office hours and it made a huge difference. Often there were no or only a few other students there. I got the help I needed and the professors often  got to know me on a first name basis, and it paid off.


One semester I was literally 0.1 percent away from testing out of my final. I went to office hours to talk about it, and my professor agreed to look over my last quiz. Low and behold, he found enough partial credit in that quiz to round me up. I got an A in the class and got to skip the final.


One more LPT. If you plan on going to grad school, your professor knows you and you do well in the class; ask for a letter of recommendation at the end of the semester. Be prepared to bring a CV so that they have something specifically good to write about you. Don't wait until your senior year to go back and ask. They will probably have forgotten you and will give you a general letter which only mentions your grade.


TLDR; go to your professor's office hours and if you do well in the class ask for a letter of recommendation from them at the end of the semester.
