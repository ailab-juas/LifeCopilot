title:
LPT: throw a closer friend gathering as a pre-party to never flop another party again

content:
My friends and I learned this in college. Invite a smaller group (proportional to the size of party you want) over for video games, cooking, gift exchange (season dependant), pre-drinking or just a more intimate hang an hour before you tell everyone else to arrive. By the time the party starts you've got a good time already going, and avoid the awkward "ten minutes with that one dude you don't really know before everyone else gets here"
