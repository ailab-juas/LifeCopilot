YSK old people do not often feel old. Treating them as an old person, only reminds them that they look old on the outside.

Why YSK: As I get older, I realised that people call me old, treat me old, and generally think that because I am old, that I think certain things. 

When I go out to dinner with other people from the company, or am around younger people in general, there is often an unspoken moment that people try to switch conversations when I am part of the group. It makes people feel uncomfortable because they attempt to change the conversation to match my age and what they think they should be talking about. 

It would be really super if people talked to me without taking my age in to account, because when comments about my age appear in decisions or conversations, it just reminds me that I am different to they are on the outside, because I still feel very young on the inside, I often forget that I am older than my colleagues (my memory isn't what it used to be haha), and they often remind me, which is a bit of a shame. :-)
