YSK: Almost all of the optical shops in the US are owned by the same company. You can save a lot of money on eyeglasses by learning which one's are still independent.

Why YSK: You will pay at least 3X too much for exams, prescriptions, and glasses at most US optical shops.

In the US, Europe, and perhaps other parts of the world, one company has basically cornered the optical market and now holds a monopoly so they can charge whatever they want. The same company owns almost all of the 'independent' optical shops, lens suppliers, and all designer frame manufacturers. There are only a few truly independent companies still in this space. Costco and Walmart are two notable exceptions that I'm aware of. Both offer an exam and complete set of glasses for around $100, compared to $400-$600 at 99% of the others.
