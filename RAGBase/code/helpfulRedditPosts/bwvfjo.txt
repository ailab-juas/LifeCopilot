YSK that Chase Bank just merged with another bank and the company will waive your right to take them to court unless you mail them a rejection letter.

As the result of a bank merger, Chase Bank is now requiring all its credit card holders to accept a waiver of your right to take a claim against them to court. 

You can reject this, but you have to mail it into them.

Edit: I am not affiliated with the company at all. I hold a card with them and noticed this slimy practice in the fine print.
