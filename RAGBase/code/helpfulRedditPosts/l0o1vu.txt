YSK that when asked for your address, name, phone number or other personal information by a cashier, "No thank you" is a perfectly acceptable answer. Protect your privacy.

Why YSK: I'm posting this because that has always been my answer, and more often than not they look at me like I have three heads, which tells me that it's not a common response they get. While they may need that for you to get a 5% discount next time you go in, the real reason they want it is to sell your information and have you receive unsolicited phone calls. To that I say, no thank you.
