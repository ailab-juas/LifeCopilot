LPT: Use a water bottle as a dry bag

content:
Need a dry bag? Use a water bottle such as a Nalgene to store things like keys, wallet, snacks or cell phone for a day on the water. Almost everyone has one and it floats. 

Edit: It seems I forgot to mention that obviously a dry bag will provide much more utility in this department than a water bottle. I have a dry bag but I frequent the river so much that I have showed up without it and tend to always have my water bottle which has kept my thing dry for the day.

Also some people are not sure where to put their water. Just pour the water into a dry bag and you can drink it from there.
