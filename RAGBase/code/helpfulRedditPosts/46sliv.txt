YSK how to de-skunk yourself or a pet.

content:
Tomato juice is a myth and does not work.  

Mix peroxide and dish washing soap (I prefer Dawn for this), then throw in baking soda. wash with the soapy foamy peroxide water.

Skunk scent is oil based, dish soap breaks it down. The smell is neutralized by oxygen- this mix drowns it in oxygen.

Huge improvement on one wash. Repeat next day and it will be nearly undetectable. No matter what it will take days for the smell to be gone entirely- but it will be very very much weakened by this.
