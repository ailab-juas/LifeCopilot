LPT: When talking a friend who is suffering from grief, illness, or other tragedy, let them determine the length of the conversation.

content:
Even if you don't know what to say and there are long pauses, wait for them to tell you good bye. Keep asking questions, even if it's just small talk about the weather, until they cue the end of the conversation. By letting them control the conversation in this subtle way you give them the chance to open up and not feel rushed or abandoned.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing your stories, I know how hard it is to put yourself out there like that.  Internet hugs all around!
