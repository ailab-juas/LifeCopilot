LPT: When moving into a new house, create a separate email account for the house.

content:
I asked for advice on moving into our first house a while ago and this was one of the tips. We did it and had no idea how handy it would be.

We have all our bills, white goods receipts, WiFi, everything, set up with this account and it’s amazing.

People are always amazed when they find out, even estate agents. Thought I’d share the love, hope it helps.

EDIT: thanks for the positive comments, it helped us out when we got our first place so hope it helps as well. A lot of people are asking what “white goods” are. It’s like household appliances and I assume it’s a British term.

EDIT: also a lot of people are saying it’s useless or more work, it’s just a personal opinion that it’s handy. I also like that my spouse can be logged in as well and handle any bills as I work away a lot

EDITEDIT: this blew up and I didn’t think it would. Not sure why this is such a divisive topic, half seem to love it and half hate it. The majority of the other side are saying just make a folder in normal gmail. I’m not saying this will work for everyone but we have busy personal lives with my spouse being a freelancer with the need for multiple emails, and myself likewise. I know how to use folders and have many set up in my work emails, this just works best to keep it entirely separate. Spouse has access to my personal emails whenever she wants by just going on my phone, but why would she want to receive all my boring newsletters about classic cars and old Volvos in her inbox? Also, it’s just a small tip that helped me out, no one’s forcing you to do it. Glad it helped some, have a great week
