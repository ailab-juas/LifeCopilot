LPT: If you remember something right before going to bed and want to wake up remembering it, just throw a random object on the floor. When you wake up you will wonder why that object is there and then remember why you threw it.

I remember reading this somewhere a few years ago and I never stopped doing it. Whether I have an early doctor's appointment or I need to do some laundry in the morning, I throw any random object I find beside me and wake up remembering that I have something to do.  Works 100% of the time.
