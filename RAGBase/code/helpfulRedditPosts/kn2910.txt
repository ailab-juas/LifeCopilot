LPT: If you’re on zoom call, make it a habit to mute yourself by default and hold space bar to unmute temporarily while you speak. This will save you from unknowingly leaving yourself unmuted.

Not just zoom, most other softwares/apps have this “push to talk” feature. This will make sure that you explicitly press and hold a button of sorts to unmute yourself - reducing the chances of leaving yourself unmuted without your knowledge.
