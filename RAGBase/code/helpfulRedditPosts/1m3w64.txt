LPT: Give your shower walls a quick wipe-down after each shower and you'll never fight mildew and hard water stains again.

I have been doing this for about 10 years now, and I haven't had a single speck of mildew/soap scum/hard water stains on my shower walls/doors since.  They are spotless and look brand new.. I never have to clean them.  

I keep a small face towel nearby and wipe the walls down after my shower.  It only takes about 30 seconds and will save your grout and shower doors in the long run.  I've never met anyone else who does this but it's one of my personal best LPTs.

EDIT:  This is not "cleaning", you're just drying off the walls.  You are not spending any significant amount of time doing this.. I'm talking 3 quick wipes with a small towel on each wall to get the big drops off.  Takes no time at all and prevents a lot of time, money, chemicals and elbow grease in the future.
