YSK that in Canada (at least), there is a subtle hand signal for use during video calls being promoted by the Canadian Women's Foundation to indicate domestic violence.

&gt;Gunraj explained the signal involves putting one hand up, palm facing toward the camera, then tucking the thumb in and curling the fingers down over it into a fist. The idea is that the signal won't leave a digital footprint.

Maybe this can be expanded to other countries?
