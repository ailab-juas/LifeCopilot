LPT: You can always negotiate your rent. Even if you have been living in the unit for years.

I live in the heart of a pretty expensive city. I have been renting this unit for almost 2 years and rent was increased once by $100. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the real estate and rental market in this city, and surrounding areas, has been shifting. I did some research and found units in the same apartment building, going for $200 - $250 less than what I was paying. I simply stated that fair market value was no longer what I was paying and requested a re-evaluation. To my surprise, they agreed. Fact of the matter is that if I terminated my tenancy, they would need to look for someone else and would not be able to charge what they are currently charging me. The time/effort involved as well for them to find a new tenant weighs in as opportunity cost for the landlord as well. 

Long story short, do your research and always advocate for yourself!
