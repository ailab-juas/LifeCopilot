LPT : When your spouse is getting ready and the time to leave is approaching. Instead of reminding them they have 5 minutes left, ask them if you can help with anything.

I've noticed reminding the time just makes them more frustrated and it does nothing to help the situation.  you could actually be helping the situation because there may be  another task to complete before leaving that you are not privy of.
