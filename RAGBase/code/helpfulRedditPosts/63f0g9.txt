YSK: Bosses take note - Administrative Professionals' Day (aka Secretary's Day) is Wednesday, April 26th.

Admin Assistants do far more than most departments realize.  We are babysitters, cat-herders, mothers, diplomats, travel agents, event coordinators, human organizers, repositories of more information than you'll ever care to know, and holders of the magic wands that make sure your department (and your company) actually function.  We've handled more personal errands and random non-company tasks than you can imagine.  And we usually do it with a smile no matter how much finagling, negotiating, and arm twisting it may have taken to do it.

When we do our jobs well, you'll never notice because everything runs smoothly, everyone has what they need to focus on their own jobs, and we make everyone else look good.  When things go wrong, we're often the ones who get blamed.

If your department or your Department Head has an Admin Assistant, or you *are* the boss and you have an Admin, take a few minutes and get them a card, a small plant, some flowers, or a little thing you know they'd like (or do a group thing from the whole department) and let them know you appreciate them.  Being an admin is often a thankless job because we aren't included when a team is recognized after a project is done or a quarterly sales record is broken.

Admins make your professional lives possible.  So please make a note to take a moment and recognize us.  For most admins, a little thanks goes a long way.
