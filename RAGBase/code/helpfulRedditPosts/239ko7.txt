LPT: When conveying your condolences stick to "I'm very sorry for your loss" and avoid the temptation to say something "profound" or anything of the sort.

content:
My (close relative) died recently and while most people stuck to saying something like "so sorry" or "my condolences" there were a few misguided morons, some well-meaning and some not so much, who felt this was a great opportunity to share some words of wisdom, an author's quote, or even scripture. 

In reality, the only people who had something worthwhile to say were those who knew him well. And even most of them stuck to just being there with me instead of trying to be deep. How I felt was, there is nothing deeper than death, and they just ended up looking silly. Or worse. 

From a very moving [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1uq94v/the_six_month_belated_punch_in_the_gut/) by a man who lost his child: "Every one wants their Hallmark moment, where they can drop a quote and be a stone in your Path to Recovery. Like one day you'll make a toast about how hard it is, but it's okay you've survived and beat this dead kid thing and look at them and give them a weary, trusting smile."

Edit: I feel compelled to add that this advice is not meant for all situations. If you are close, you'll know what to say that will go over well. If you're not, then stick to something non-offensive like the advice above if you must say anything -- or even better, a simple silent embrace. Remember: it's about giving (comforting) instead of taking (trying to impress). 

Also a nice letter or email sent a few days after the funeral is a great idea, in my opinion. I wish I had gotten more of those.
