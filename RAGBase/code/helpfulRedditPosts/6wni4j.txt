YSK: The reason there are policies that your dog needs to be leashed in certain areas (apartment complexes, parks, etc.) isn't because YOUR dog might have issues, it is because someone else's dog might.

**EDIT** I think the title is confusing a lot of people. My point is that if your dog is unleashed, he could be the best dog in the world, but if he approaches a leashed dog it could spark a huge problem. As an owner, I can't do anything about a dog that I dont know approaching mine if they're unleashed. If that same dog is leashed, I can tell the owners that my dog isn't playing nice right now so their dog can't say hello. I understand  I'm "someone else" in this case. We're working on it.

As someone who adopted a dog that is aggressive around small dogs, this is super frustrating where I live. Dogs **need** to be on a leash at all times if you're in any area where there could be others.

Just the other night, I was out walking my pup and an unleashed pitbull ran up and approached mine. I couldn't react fast enough before they started fighting, and my dog latched onto the pitbull's neck. Fortunately both were okay, but most dogs need slow and controlled greetings, otherwise it can turn into a competition to see who is the Alpha.

I would be heartbroken to have my dog put down if he severely hurt a dog that is unleashed. I can't force someone else's unleashed dog to not approach mine, but they can do their part and put them on a leash so the owners can communicate if the dogs are okay to meet or not.
