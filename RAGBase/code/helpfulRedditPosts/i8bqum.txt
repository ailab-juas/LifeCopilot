LPT: Applying heat can eliminate the itching effect of mosquito bite

content:
If you heat a metal spoon just enough to be hot but not to burn your skin and press it over a mosquito bite for a minute - heat will destroy injected proteins and you can forget about that bite in couple minutes.

EDIT: listen, folks:

1. The source of heat doesn’t matter. Just don’t burn your skin and don’t turn your surroundings into ashes
2. There are better medical options for this. Google it and use heat only if you’re in the middle of nowhere and it’s the last hope
3. DON’T MICROWAVE SPOONS
4. There are special devices to replace spoons, google “bite away” and analogous things

EDIT 2:
1. People report it works for poison ivy too
2. The reasons it works may be different: not an injected protein denaturation but changing receptors activity which alters your body reactions. It works anyway.
3. People apply A LOT of different things onto mosquito bites.
