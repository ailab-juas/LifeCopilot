LPT: Want a password that always "stays" with you? The back cover of every hand watch has a unique serial number you can use as a password and never forget.

content:
And even if you lose your watch, the serial numbers are still in the warranty paper. 
Most serial numbers have a combination of letters and numerals.

Edit: If you have multiple passwords secured on a third party software/website, you can set the master password to the watch serial number.
