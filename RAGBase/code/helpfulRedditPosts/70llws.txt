LPT: If you have a front-load washer, always leave the door ajar to avoid nasty mildew/mold/smells.

Sat next to some nice people at the movie theater today, their clothes reeked like nasty mildew, easy to guess why.  Front-loader washers, HE machines, need to be left open to avoid anaerobic mold growth.  Once that shit sets in it's terribly hard to eliminate, the mold literally eats its way into the rubber gaskets and boot.  Check your owners manual and it probably recommends it be kept open.

My in-laws threw out a couple of front-load washers before figuring this out.  Our new machine has *never* been kept closed and it still smells brand new a year after purchase, no chemicals.  The gaskets are pristine.  

Many front-loaders also offer "fresh" option after your load has finished to draw fresh air in and tumble until you can move the load into the dryer, which also helps avoid that musty smell, especially if you're forgetful.
