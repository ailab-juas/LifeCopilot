LPT: Small Business owners: when hiring for a position, let all applicants know the outcome. This isn’t wasted time and will increase your business’s sense of professionalism.

content:
It really is so unprofessional to not acknowledge applicants. Remember that people applying to the job are actually doing you a favour, not the other way around. This is especially true if they have set time aside to come in for an interview.  Even if you have to let someone know they didn’t make the cut, they will appreciate knowing.
