LPT: Having some time before leaving for work to just relax makes a huge difference.

content:
I used to wake up at 740, then after showering, getting ready, getting lunch together, i would have to rush out the door at 815 to get to work on time. I started making my lunch at night and throwing it in the fridge, laying out my outfit the night before, and setting my alarm to 720 instead. I now have about 20 - 25 minutes in the morning that i can just chill on the couch under my SAD light and drink some water and i feel way better going into work.
