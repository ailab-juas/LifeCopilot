LPT: If you’re alone and trying to find the correct breaker to do electrical work, plug a radio into the outlet where you need to work and turn it up all the way. When the music stops, you’ll know you’ve got the right breaker.

They make tools to do this, but this works in a pinch rather than walking back and forth.  

Also you should ABSOLUTELY still test the outlet/fixture if it’s still hot or not.
