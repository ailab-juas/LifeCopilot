Hello LPT community! Off the top of your head, what are some commonly submitted LPTs you're tired of seeing? Please comment within.

Hello LPT community!  The mod team is potentially looking into adding a link in the sidebar to **reference frequently submitted LifeProTips and LPT requests.** Ideally we'd also like to add links to where users can visit such commonly discussed topics and threads if interested.

Things like:

LPT: Use a hairdryer to defog a mirror.

LPT: Take a picture of something you need to remember.

LPT: Lose your phone charger? Ask the hotel front desk.

LPT: Need to de-wrinkle a shirt? Throw the item and a wet towel into the dryer for 5 minutes.

LPT Request: How do I stop sweating so much?

LPT Request: Study tips for final exams?

-----

I think you get the idea. Basically LPTs you see posted and think, "why is this here?? AGAIN??"

**Please share any that you would like to see added to the list.** Any other comments/thoughts/concerns/issues you would also like to address are also encouraged. Myself and the mod team will be reading through them. :)

Thanks!
