LPT: If you are broke, shop for food at Indian grocery stores

content:
Many of you already know rice and beans are cheap. But Indian grocery stores take it to another level. You can get variety of cheap ingredients like lentils, chickpeas, variety of dried beans, millets etc. in bulk for almost half the price. Their fresh produce is cheaper too compared to most stores. You don’t have to know how to make Indian food, there are plenty of affordable spice mixes and sauces with simple instructions. Explore a store near you and begin experimenting. It’s way better than living on ramen and hot dogs.

When I was in college, I had less than 200$ per month for food. But I never went hungry or lacked nutrition because I exclusively shopped at Indian stores. I never missed takeout too much because I learnt to make flavorful meals with simple ingredients. These shelf stable ingredients are a base for many dishes: rice, split peas (toor dal), turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, ginger garlic paste (sold in a bottle). 

I’m doing fairly well now, financially but I’m still amazed when I walk away from an Indian store with ingredients for 2-3 dinners for under 30$.

Edit: Few people commenting that 200$ is a lot, it’s not where I lived. Also, I had UNDER 200$ spending money which I mostly used on food. Idk how you guys think that’s “rich”. No matter what your budget is, you get more bang for your buck at ethnic grocery stores and that’s the tip I’m trying to share.
