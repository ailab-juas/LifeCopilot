LPT: If you have a comfortable lifestyle and get a huge raise, bank it. Don't upgrade your lifestyle. By saving and investing, you can maintain your lifestyle forever.

Wow, this blew up.  Thanks for the great comments (even the dissenters).   One question stuck out:  Why do this?   The short answer is that (a) you can retire earlier with enough income to keep doing everything you want and (b) advances in the study of aging mean that some of you will live to 125 or maybe even longer.  If you retire at 60, that means that approx. 40 years of earning will have to generate enough income for at least 40-60 years of retired life.  Living sensibly now means that you can maintain your current lifestyle indefinitely.  

Here is the alternative:
