LPT: Learn to enjoy things by yourself. You don't wanna miss out all the fun if you keep waiting for other people!

This is the best advice I can give that I've learned through my life. 

Don't wait for other people if you want to do something fun - just go and do it by yourself.

Doesn't matter what. Movies? Games? Travelling? Just do it by yourself and enjoy your time. 

In the end - we only can count on ourselves. :)

^(And if you're depressed, like me, it's okay to not want to do or enjoy anything sometimes. Just try to make small steps everyday - even if it's "just" making a tea, taking a shower etc. I believe in you. Mental health is no fun oftentimes and as a person suffering from BPD, it's often hard for me to enjoy something but I try my best.)

^(edit: thanks for the silver! :] )
