LPT: If you're withdrawing from drugs and wondering if you'll ever feel normal again, don't give up. Don't buy the lie that this is just how your body is and you'll never be well again. It can take up to a year for your body to balance back out. Keep going. You'll get better.

You don't need 20 pain pills a day to feel normal. It might be like that right now, but that is not your body's normal state. You're body's pain receptors will eventually balance out and your tolerance will return to normal. You won't feel like death forever, I promise.
