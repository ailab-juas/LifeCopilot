YSK: A frequently overlooked rule of Monopoly is auctioning a property that someone lands on but can't afford/doesn't want. This increases game time exponentially.

"Monopoly takes too long!"

NOT WITH AUCTIONS, YA TURKEY! Read the rules! If you land on a property and don't want it or can't afford it, it MUST immediately go up for auction! Game time is halved, if not more! Also, no free parking money, sorry!

Of course, house rules are house rules! Use whatever ya want! But if duration of the game is a concern: auction!

**EDIT: increase game speed, *decrease game time**

Doh!
