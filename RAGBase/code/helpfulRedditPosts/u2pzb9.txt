LPT: use aluminum foil and a bowl when straining ground beef or any food you’re trying to separate grease. Don’t pour your grease down the drain.

content:
I use a paper bowl and place a small sheet of aluminum foil on top of the bowl. I then mold it to the shape of the bowl and pull the sides upwards to prevent any grease from spilling out. Strain your ground beef/meat into the foil. Once it cools down, you can throw it in the trash instead of dumping it down the drain which will clog your drains inevitably costing you money when you have to call a plumber.
