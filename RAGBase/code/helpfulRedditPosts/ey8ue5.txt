title:
YSK that you shouldn't drink grapefruit juice when you're taking medications

content:
Grapefruit juice contains inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme that is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs. This can lead to adverse effects or reduced drug effect. You can find a list of common drugs that interact with grapefruit juice [Here.](https://www.drugs.com/article/grapefruit-drug-interactions.html)

Edit: I made it look like you can never consume grapefruits while taking drugs. Most medications don't interact with grapefruit juice. Ask your doctor/pharmacist if this is the case with the drugs you're taking.

Edit 2: This also includes eating a grapefruit. I thought this was obvious.

Edit 3: Poor wording. Grapefruit-drug interactions can either increase (and cause side effects) OR decrease the effect of drugs. That depends on the drugs you're taking.
