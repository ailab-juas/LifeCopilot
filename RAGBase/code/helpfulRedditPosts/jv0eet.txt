LPT: Tell your toddler a movie as a bedtime story starring them for an easier bedtime

content:
Tell your toddle a movie you know as a story, starring them, for easier bedtime.

LPT: Toddlers and children haven’t seen the sheer number of movies you have, so use that to your advantage.

Tell them the story of Moana, Star Wars, The Princess Bride or Snow White, with them starring you’ll have their undivided attention.

Makes it much easier to put them to bed.

Thank you for the gold, awards and upvotes, it blew up more than I imagined.

Make sure you spend time with your kids (of if they’re friends/families)

Storytelling is a skill, and I’m not a creative person so stealing and sharing ideas is a way of life for me. Kids just want your time and attention, a bad story is better than no story, and you’ll get better as time goes by.
