YSK that your documents are as likely to get destroyed by mould or mildew as by fire or flood

content:
Why YSK:-Many homes get damp in winter, many cupboards, basements and lofts are susceptible to damp. People always think about fire and flood when they package up passports/driver’s licenses, exam certs but they don’t think about the cold or damp.
Package them in a plastic wallet
Photocopy a spare set and do the same but place them elsewhere
Upload a digital image to an only you cloud
Put a dehumidifier or silica gel packet in your plastic wallet to take the water out
Don’t place in the basement, or near to a wall that might get damp in winter
Check them regularly- you might need to show these documents for the rest of your life so take good care of them
If you follow these steps you are more likely to keep those documents safe for longer.
