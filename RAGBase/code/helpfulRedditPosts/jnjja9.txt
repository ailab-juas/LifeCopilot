LPT: Remember that an adult is just a child who got older. "Growing up" means having obligations and trauma that shape your life and personality. Taking this into consideration when dealing with difficult people can put things in perspective and strengthen your sense of empathy.

Despite there being age requirements on smoking, drinking, voting, and entertainment, nobody just wakes up as an Adult™ on their 18th or 21st birthday. We all have different priorities and it's important to remember this when judging and dealing with people who don't have the same skill, knowledge, experience, or opinions as you.

You can't always know what their trauma and obligations are, but you can make better guesses the more you get to know them. With enough time they may open up to you about it, so you won't have to guess anymore and you can use that information to know what subjects and situations to avoid. People tend to remember bad times more clearly than good times, so their existence is often shaped around avoiding or aggressively attacking the source of their worst memories.

You can *(and should)* also take the time to find out what makes them happy, and ask them to expand on good memories when they talk about them. You can use that information to plan activities, give gifts, and make new memories *(just don't try to recreate everything from their past, they may find it creepy)*.

This applies to everyone you deal with in life, but more so to those you can't get away from – family, coworkers, etc.
