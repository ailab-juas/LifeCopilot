LPT: Deer often hide/leave fawns in high grass at this time of the year. If you are mowing high grass with a Riding Mower or similar machine take extra time and check entire field before you start. If you do find one don't be afraid to move it, mama deer will not abandon fawn because of your scent!

Edit: According to rural veterinarian we talked to over the weekend it is fairly common at this time of the year for people to bring in animals ( mainly fawns ) that were hit or even ran over by various lawn mowers.
