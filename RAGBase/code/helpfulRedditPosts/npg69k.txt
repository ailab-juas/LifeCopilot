LPT: Private property is not public property because it's open to the public

content:
I'm sure you've all seen these videos where people think they can record or refuse to leave stores, etc. and then always state the reason as "this is public property."

Please know that almost no buildings or parking lots are public property. If they tell you to leave or stop filming, you are breaking the law if you do not do so.

Apparently, this is not common knowledge, so I think we need to spread the word.
