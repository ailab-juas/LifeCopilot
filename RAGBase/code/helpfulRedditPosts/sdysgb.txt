LPT: This is a friendly reminder that employees currently have more power to negotiate for improved benefits and pay raises than at any point in the last 20+ years. Take advantage of it!!

content:
Due to the shortage of employees, most employers are desperate for good help. That means you should be seeking pay raises, promotions, and increased benefits.

Unless you are completely satisfied with your job and your income, shop around. Chances are you will find someone desperate for help and willing to pay more than your current employer. If you like your job, shop around anyway, then politely ask your employer to match/beat those offers.

Look after yourself! This employment opportunity will not last forever!
