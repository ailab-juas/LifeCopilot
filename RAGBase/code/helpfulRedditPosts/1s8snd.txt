title:
YSK according to US Federal Law, all tipped employees should be receiving at least the federal minimum wage, $7.25.

content:
The only time a tipped employee can be paid [$2.13+ an hour](http://www.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/flsa/002.htm) is if that person makes more or equal to the [federal minimum wage](http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/minimumwage.htm) with tips. If the tipped employee is being paid less than $7.25 an hour with tips, [the employer is required to make up the difference](http://www.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/flsa/002.htm).

[The following states do no allow tip credit at all, and must be paid at least the minimum wage](http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm) (whichever is greater state vs federal): Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington.
