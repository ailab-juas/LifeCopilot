LPT: If you want to move up in a company/increase your work load, don’t just ask your manager for something more to do. Find a problem, then make yourself the solution. It shows initiative and is a lot better than just walking up and saying “I’d like more to do.”

content:
If you are just blindly asking, you’re putting them on the spot and they either won’t think of anything, or give you crap tasks that don’t further your progress in the company.  

If you come to them with a specific task in mind, especially if it’s for a problem or issue you’ve identified and you already know how to correct it/complete the task with ease, it will get you a lot further.   It also shows a great deal of initiative and will have them start thinking of you for things in the future. 

Edit:  A lot of you are interpreting this as just doing something and not asking.  I fully meant it to come off as asking your boss first.  I only meant it as it being a lot better to come to your boss with something in mind for a problem you have identified, rather than just walking up and blindly asking.   

Edit 2:  there’s a lot of negative people here saying you just get overworked/not rewarded.  All I have to say to that is, sometimes you’ve got to get shit on before your seed will sprout.
