LPT: You don't need to force yourself to make friends or talk to everyone in order to become social in places you frequent. Being kind and polite to people you meet, even in the smallest, is already good enough.

If you're too quiet, don't try to jump out of your comfort zone by trying to engage in conversations with people. Just, you know, give them a "good morning" and a smile as you pass through. That's enough. Being known as friendly is the most important.
