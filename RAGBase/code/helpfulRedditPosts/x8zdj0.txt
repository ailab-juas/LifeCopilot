LPT: Putting on some music in the background helps shoppers at your garage sale/yard sale/rummage sale relax and fills in any awkward silences.

content:
I'm currently helping my parents with their neighborhood garage sale and I noticed it was really quiet and whispery among shoppers. I put on golden oldies (least offensive/tolerable music I could listen to) on my phone and it's really lightened the mood.

Seems like the shoppers have relaxed and are more conversational, so hopefully that'll lead to more sales. But adding some light hearted music has really made it less awkward between the shoppers and the sellers (my parents).
