YSK: Beware of Sentry brand flea remover - it killed my dog and thousands of others

content:
I'm sure that the majority of people have had no problems with this brand, but I bought it recently assuming that a flea medicine placed right next to Frontline and K9 Advantix wouldn't be so absolutely horrible. I was proved wrong. My poor, one year-old Hagrid had a bad case of fleas and I attempted to help the young guy and ended up murdering him. I feel horrid and I want everyone to know that this medicine has the potential to kill your beloved friends.

[Here](http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/sentry.html) are hundreds of reviews for Sentry detailing how their "medicine" killed pets in horrific ways.

Beware and take care.
