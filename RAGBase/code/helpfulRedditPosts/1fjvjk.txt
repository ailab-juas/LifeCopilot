title:
YSK about the mammalian diving reflex and how to use it to combat anxiety and strong emotions

content:
All mammals have something called the “mammalian diving reflex” that forces the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) to kick in, which functions to relax us and calm us down.

When in an extremely heightened state of emotional arousal:

* Fill a bowl with icy cold water
* Bend/lean over
* Hold your breath
* Put face in icy cold water for 30 seconds
* Make sure that area underneath eyes/above cheekbones (most sensitive part of the face) feels the icy water
