LPT: (online shopping) When you next see a discount code online e.g. "use CODE10 for 10% off" - there is absolutely no harm in trying CODE20 first.

content:
In many cases there are codes that are valid all year round but they only get advertised at certain times. 

Heck! Whenever you're at the online checkout and you see the option to apply a discount code, try a generic one like "TWITTER10" or "BRAND10".

(Source: I am a digital marketer that sets these codes up and am also lazy.)

EDIT: A popular comment is that there is a browser extension called Honey that does this for you.
