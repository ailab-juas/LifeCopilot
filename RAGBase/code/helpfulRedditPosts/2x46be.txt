YSK how to land correctly to avoid a dangerous fall...

content:
It's going to happen at some point, and you can't beat Newton's laws of motion when it does. Might as well be prepared. I've taken Taekwondo for seven years, and here are the most important things to know when you fall.

1. Watch your head. This is the most important part. Remember to tuck your chin and turn your head before you hit the ground.
2. Just go with the fall, don't try to stop it with your hands. If you can, roll your body to the side. You don't want a fractured wrist.
3. For harder falls, spread out the forces of impact by landing with as much of your core body as you can. Your sides and butt provide more padding than you back. Also, keep your knees and elbows bent.
4. Breathe normally.

Yes, I know falling is reactive instead of proactive, but if you know these tips beforehand, it could help avoid serious injury at least having them in the back of your mind. Here [a good video](http://youtu.be/KckLm2m4tIo?t=1m5s) I found on the subject, if you need a visual demonstration.
