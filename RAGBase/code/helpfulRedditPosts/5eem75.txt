LPT: My eight y/o daughter puts plastic wrap over her eyes to chop onions. No tears. Thought of it on her own.

Edit: She takes a little piece if Saran Wrap and puts it over her eyes. It evidently stays in place with plastic wrap magic much to my surprise. Yes, she chops onions and has used a knife supervised since she was 4. No injuries. She likes to help out and we let her before she becomes a teenager.
