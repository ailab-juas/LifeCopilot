LPT: Set a keyboard text replacement on your phone to change "@@" to your email address.

content:
It makes signing into accounts much easier.  


Edit: I forgot to put how, and only know iOS as an iPhone user.

iOS: Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Text Replacement  
Phrase=email address  
Shortcut=@@

My favourite (the real) LPT in the comments, "@1", "@2", "@3", etc for multiple email addresses.  


And yes password managers are great but I lack commitment to services.
