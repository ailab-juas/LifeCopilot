LPT: Doing things slowly makes you better and faster at doing them.

content:
Slowing yourself down and taking actions deliberately can help you improve your focus and achieve goals in a more timely manner. As pointed out in many of the great comments below, this is a principle known as **Mindfulness** and is the baseline for a lot of common learning approaches (particularly mentioned were military drills, music practice, fitness, and meditation, among many others) 
The principle can be applied to just about anything, even outside of learning, and can make some of the most mundane or tedious tasks much more rewarding, efficient, and even relaxing. 

Give it a try! Youâ€™d be amazed how going slower and being more deliberate can actually speed you up! 

*EDITED for clarity and composition. Thank you for all of the great comments!*
