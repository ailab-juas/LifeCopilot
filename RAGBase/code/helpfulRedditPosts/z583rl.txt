LPT: Your memory is SO MUCH more powerful than you think… we were just never taught to use it properly at school. Learning techniques like “Memory Palaces” will let you learn anything FAR faster

The important concepts with the best educational resources i've ever found on memory techniques:

**(1) Spaced repetition -** this technique lets you remember things by systematically reminding you of the information over time in a spread-out way optimised for your long-term memory.  Only 5 mins a day spent on this technique can have a massive impact on your memory. Its effectiveness grows exponentially over time the more you use it aswell so it quickly starts to have a massive impact on your life.

**(2) Memory palaces / Method of Loci -** our memory is much better at remembering images &amp; locations than things like concepts and text. Memory palaces take advantage of this by turning what you want to learn into an image &amp; location. You practice imagining a house you know well and then in your mind place new pieces of information in different parts of the house. It takes a lot of effort to build your memory palace to begin with but once you have it it will help you remember things efficiently for your whole life.

**(3) Mnemonics -** these are basically tricks that let you remember things more easily by associating them with different things.  The 9 types of mnemonics e.g. making a rhyme out of something you want to remember e.g. linking together different things you want to remember into a story

**(4) Why memory is important** \- your memory is surprisingly important for your learning speed. If you remember more you can understand and contexualise more things and therefore learn ***much*** faster. These two articles explain in more depth why memory is so important.
