LPT: If you need extra hours at work, ask coworkers that you don't get along with.

content:
If you're working in a place that allows it, ask coworkers that you don't get along with for their hours. Tell them that if they wanna take a day or a weekend off, you'll gladly fill in for them. That way, if they say yes, you'll get more hours, and it guarantees that you won't have to work alongside people that you don't work well with.

Edit: Okay, I GUESS there's a chance it might also probably make it possible that your relationship with your coworker will improve a smidge.
