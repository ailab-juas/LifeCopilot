LPT: Don't try to pay a bill/debt/ex-spouse in pennies. They can reject the payment and you'll be stuck with the pennies

content:
Working at a financial, I have had numerous people say they want to get hundreds, or even thousands of dollars in pennies. They want to do this to pay a bill/fine/something they think is unfair. We have been able to talk most people out of doing this, but I spoke with someone who tried to pay a multi-thousand dollar bill in pennies (getting the pennies elsewhere). 

If you try to do this, what will most likely happen is: You will get the pennies. You'll try to give the pennies to said entity to pay. They'll reject said payment (as they have the right to). You will then be stuck with the pennies, unable to exchange them back at your financial.

Don't be that person. Just toughen up and pay the bill normally.
