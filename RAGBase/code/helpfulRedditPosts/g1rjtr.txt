LPT: Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to condone or accept their actions and it doesn’t mean you have to reconcile with them.

content:
I think it’s a common misconception (that I had fallen into again and again) that forgiveness is for the other person - really, I think forgiveness is more about coming to terms with what has happened and making the choice to let go of the negative, frustrated and angry feelings that may be impacting your day to day life.

I found this worksheet https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/forgiveness-therapy.pdf extremely helpful and I now use it with my clients too.
