LPT: If you keep your phone locked with a password, use an image with an alternate phone number as your lock screen.

This weekend, for the third time, I found a locked smart phone. As the screen is locked and I have no chance of guessing the password, I can't figure out who the phone belongs to so I can return it.

Edit: I know you're all *so* concerned, but the owner FINALLY called the phone and set up a time to come pick it up from me.
