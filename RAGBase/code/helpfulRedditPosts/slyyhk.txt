LPT: We live in the Information Era. Please, put as much effort as you can into answering your children's questions regarding everyday things

content:
"Why does it rain? "What is butter made of?" "Why do we dream?" "Do dogs understand us?"

Children have thousands of questions like that. They want answers, they want to learn.

Use Google and other available tools to search those answers, and you may even learn a thing or two. It can be exhausting sometimes, but the feeling of seeing them understand is worth it.

^(And PLEASE don't use religion. I grew up in a household where 99% of my questions would be answered with "Because God wanted it that way". That's just going to make your child incurious, quiet, and unmotivated to learn.)
