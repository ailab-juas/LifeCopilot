LPT: If your cat is getting older, consider getting him/her a heating pad, heated pod, or heated bed. A cat's normal body temperature is higher than yours.

You know how old people are always complaining about it being cold?  It's even worse for older cats whose normal body temperature is between 99 and 102.5 degrees depending on the cat.

I've got a pair of 18 year old cats who spend much of their days happily lounging on different heated surfaces.  

There are many tons of safe and inexpensive options on the market.  Running a low temperature heated bed around the clock costs pennies and can make your kitties happy.
