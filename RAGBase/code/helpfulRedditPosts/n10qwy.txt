LPT: If you feel you're always the one reaching out to friends, accept that this may just be a feeling, and that others may feel it too.

Making plans with others can be exhausting, because of the perceived imbalance of effort, and the uncertainty of who and how many people will agree to meet up can flare up a little social anxiety.

Accept that others may have stopped making that effort so often for similar reasons. If nobody cared whether or not their efforts to socialise fell flat, we'd all make them far more often.
