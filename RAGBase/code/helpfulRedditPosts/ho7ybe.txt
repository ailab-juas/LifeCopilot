LPT: If someone comes to you upset about something, don't try to solve their problem right away. Most people just want to feel heard and validated.

content:
Your priority should be to help them process how they're feeling, then you can tackle the problem later. So instead of immediately offering solutions, try acknowledging the person's feelings and the legitimacy of the problem they're facing.

For example, instead of...

* "Why don't you try to do..."
* "What have you done to fix it?"
* "How can I make it better?"

Try using...

* "Wow, that does sound really tough."
* "I can't imagine how hard that must be for you."
* "I would absolutely feel sad/angry/frustrated too..."

If you're not sure what someone needs, asking can be as simple as "That sounds really tough. Is there anything I can do to help or do you just want to talk about it?"
