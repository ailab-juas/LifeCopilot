YSK that there is a Poison Control Hotline for your pets.

content:
The ASPCA has a hotline open 24/7 (including all holidays) for pets who have ingested or been exposed to something potentially poisonous or harmful. (USA number, there may be an equivalent in your country)

ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center Hotline: (888) 426-4435



I was reading up on some stuff for my cat and came across this. I had no idea this existed for animals! It's one of those good-to-know things so here we are.

Here's some useful info-

[Foods to avoid feeding to your pets](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/people-foods-avoid-feeding-your-pets)

[Poisonous household products](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/poisonous-household-products)

[Poisonous Plants](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants)


Edit- apparently they may or may not charge a fee for this, since they have toxicologists there to consult.  Regardless, if you're like me and don't live in an area with immediate access to an emergency vet, having someone to call at any time who can save your pet's life is absolutely worth the fee.

Also, someone mentioned that some pet insurances have this service for free.

Edit2- /u/cheesevote mentioned that some companies like Tomcat have a phone number on the back of their products on case your pet accidentally ingests them.


ALWAYS take your pet to the vet ASAP if they ate something potentially toxic!
