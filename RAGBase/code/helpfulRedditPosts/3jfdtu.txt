LPT: Don't use your dog's kennel as a punishment.

content:
If you want to punish your dog, have a separate area or leash/chain them outside for a while instead of sending them to their kennel. By only teaching your dog to go to its kennel when it's A.) Time for sleep or B.) In the way, you teach it that the kennel is a safe place where it won't be harmed and it should be happy to go there.

If you use the kennel as a punishment it creates negative connotations which can make a dog reluctant to kennel or even make it reluctant to sleep.

As an addendum, never force your dog out of its kennel (unless it went in there to avoid doing something it doesn't like, but *isn't* scared). If you make the kennel a safe space a dog will go there when scared, and allowing it to stay in there when scared can help calm it down and also gives you a clear sign of what it's feeling.

EDIT: As has been pointed out by people in the comments, this doesn't mean you should chain a dog outside as punishment *or* send it to its kennel as punishment; rather, this was meant to address sending a dog to its kennel in anger because you don't like something it did. Less "you crapped on the floor so go in your kennel and think about what you did" and more "I can't believe you crapped on the floor, get in your kennel so I don't have to look at you and be pissed"; the former is bad logically, the second is bad because of the reasons outlined here.

Locking it away in its kennel and being angry at it isn't only a bad punishment, but can make it scared of its kennel/bed. Even if you catch them in the act, banishing them outside or anywhere *but* the kennel is preferable to making them scared of it. Punishing a dog after the act has finished has no effect regardless of whether you do or do not use a kennel.
