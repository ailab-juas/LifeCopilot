YSK: Amazon doesn’t police their 3rd party sellers

content:
Don’t assume good ratings are for the item listed. It’s very common for sellers to take a high rated item and change the listing to another item. You won’t know this unless you read the reviews. 

Why YSK: you may place an order for for an item that has ratings associated with a completely different item.
