LPT: Teach your newborn a few ASL signs. They'll pick up on these way sooner than they figure out speech/language, and you get to communicate with them earlier than you might have otherwise.

content:
Start with the "problem" messaging -- tools they can use to tell you what's bugging them. Way before she could talk, our daughter could sign us when she was thirsty/hungry. Our other kids just screamed nonspecifically until we figured it out.

Also I remember going in her room pretty early once and she was sitting up in her crib making the sign for birds. Oh, THAT'S why you're awake, good to know! Kind of cool to get that from a total baby.
