YSK that if you're baking and you have questions, King Arthur Flour has a Hotline where you can speak to a Baker free of charge.

I attempted to make bagels and they didn't come out right, so I googled and found their hotline....855 371 2253. You can talk directly to a Baker and get all your questions answered. I talked to someone for about 10 minutes who told me exactly what I did wrong and how to correct it!
