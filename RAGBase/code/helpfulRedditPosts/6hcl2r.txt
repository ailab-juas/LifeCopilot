LPT: If you use a gift card and are left with a small amount on the card, have the cashier apply it to the next person's purchase

Edit: A lot of people are asking why not just use it the next time you're there. I have had too many gift cards with a few dollars on them sit in my wallet for months because I forget about them, so instead of throwing them away or in a drawer somewhere and forgetting about them I figure it's better to let someone use it than nobody at all.
