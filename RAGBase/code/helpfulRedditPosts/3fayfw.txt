LPT: Looking for an apartment? I used to lease them, and I'll clue you in.

content:
Up until a few months ago, I managed all sorts of apartment complexes - and I'll clue you in on something: at every property, particularly large complexes, there is an absolute lowest amount of rent they can charge for an apartment. Market rent is usually $50-$200 above that amount monthly. When you tour an apartment, always tell the manager/leasing agent that your budget is about that much LESS than what they're quoting you, and mention that you've looked at a couple other places that are just as nice/convenient/whatever that fit that budget. They'll come down on the monthly rate. They budget for concessions every month to get people to move in. You talk them down $100/month and sign a year lease? Bam, $1200 saved. 

Also, get a concession off the first month by telling them you don't NEED to move until a certain point, but you'd consider moving earlier if they have a "move-in" or "look and lease" special, or need the occupancy. For example, if you start looking today, and you actually need an apartment on August 10th, DON'T TELL THEM THAT. Tell them you need to move by mid-September, but you would consider moving earlier if it was financially reasonable. They'll cut you a deal, "$500 off August" or maybe even August free, just to get you to sign. And just like that, you have a free or cheap first month just because they thought you were making a sacrifice to help them get the occupancy up at their property. 

TL;DR: Never pay full market price for an apartment. There is WAY more room for negotiation than you think.
