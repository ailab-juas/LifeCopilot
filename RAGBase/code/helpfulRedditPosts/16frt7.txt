With the passing of Aaron Schwartz, I think its important everyone be aware of the different types of support Reddit offers especially /r/suicidewatch

content:
There are multiple subs for all kinds of problems;
/r/depression
/r/alcoholism
/r/abuse
/r/bullying

Edit: Lots of downvoting happening here, please consider the impact that these subs can have on human life and mind your reddiquette. http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette
