A recent post on pics about a guy in the hospital because he couldnâ€™t afford his insulin broke my heart. If you live in the United States there are several medication assistance programs that can help you if you are struggling to afford your medication. 

[The Partnership for Prescription Assistance helps qualifying patients without prescription drug coverage get the medicines they need for free or nearly free.](https://medicineassistancetool.org)

[SingleCare offers discounted prices for many medications.](https://www.singlecare.com)
