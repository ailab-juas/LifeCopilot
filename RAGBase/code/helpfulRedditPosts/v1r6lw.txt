LPT: If someone is excited about something and shares it with you, it doesn't matter how mundane or common that thing is to you, share their excitement.

content:
After nearly a decade of living in a city I can't tell you how excited I was to see a woodpecker. I told one of my good friends who lives in the mountains and their immediate response was, "I see those all the time." Nothing kills someone's excitement more than someone making them feel like their excitement isn't worth it.

If someone is excited enough about something to show it to you or share it with you, share their excitement, don't try and discount it don't try and say your experiences matter more. If someone is excited that they see a squirrel, doesn't matter if you see squirrels every day, they are happy, allow them to be happy. If someone shares a meme with you that you already saw, just comment back the same response you had when you 1st saw it. Don't say that you already saw it. This will just make people want to share things with you less. It just makes that person feel bad.
