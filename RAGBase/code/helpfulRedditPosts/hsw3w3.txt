YSK that the reason people sometimes drive cautiously is because they may have precious cargo and not because theyâ€™re old or too cautious.

You never know what someone has in their vehicle that is making them drive slow; could be their pets or an expensive item they are transporting. I know individuals who regularly transport $15k machine parts in their personal vehicles and they need to take turns slow. Too often, I get mad at someone for not being aggressive and taking that turn or accelerating slower than I do. I forget that not everyone has an empty vehicle like mine.
