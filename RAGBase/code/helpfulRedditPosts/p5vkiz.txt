YSK that if you’re using Duolingo to learn a language and keep running out of hearts, just log into the desktop site. You don’t deal with hearts at all and you use the same account.

Why ysk:
 
The hearts system on Duolingo is quite silly if you think about it. 
If you get just 3 questions wrong on a language you obviously don’t know yet, you’re locked out from learning. 
You have to wait for hours just to be able to do any more lessons. 
This system kinda sucks if you’re like me and only have a 30 minute lunch break during the day to try and practice.

So yeah, if you just use the browser on your phone or use a computer you don’t get locked out if you get questions wrong. 

I thought this would be helpful for others to know since I discovered it on accident, happy learning!

Edit:

 Thank you everyone for all the upvotes and awards!  I especially appreciated all the recommendations for other apps as well, which I'll be trying out on top of continuing to use duolingo. 

Also if anyone's curious, the language I'm learning is Mandarin! Next year my mom and I will be going back to China and I can't wait to talk to people. If anyone has any tips or advice I would love to hear it.

 :D
