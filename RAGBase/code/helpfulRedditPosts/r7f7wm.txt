title:
YSK that you should always ask before introducing yourself or pet to a dog you don’t know

content:
Why ysk: even dogs with good owners can be aggressive or in bad moods. Many dogs are rescued from bad situations or had unfortunate experience that cause them to either not like new people or other dogs. 

These dogs still have every right to be walked around as long as the owner is conscious and doesn’t cause danger to anyone else, but if they are out of the way and you come up to them without asking you are putting yourself at risk.

Also, not all dog owners are good owners and always use caution with dogs you don’t know. Be ready to remove yourself or your dog from their reach if nescessary
