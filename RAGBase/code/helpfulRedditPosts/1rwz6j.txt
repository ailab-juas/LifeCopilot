LPT: Listen to YouTube with your screen off [iPhone]

content:
I constantly find myself trying to listen to a song on YouTube just to listen to the song. But if you turn off the screen, the music will also stop.  But now I've figured out a loop hole. 


Tip: When listening to a video, press the share button (the one that isn't the + sign) at the bottom of the player and press "Message." Once the message screen pops up you can turn off your screen and the music will still play!

edit: This is for iOS7, while using the YouTube app

edit: Thanks to saucypanda for pointing out that you have to press the "share" button, not the "+"

edit: Shoutout to [upupvote2](http://www.reddit.com/user/upupvote2), who apparently posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1rvc4w/lpt_how_to_listen_to_youtube_videos_while_your/) yesterday. **I honestly didn't see it.** I'm not here to steal your thunder, brother, I just wanted to share a tip. Give that man ([upupvote2](http://www.reddit.com/user/upupvote2)) the respect that he deserves!
