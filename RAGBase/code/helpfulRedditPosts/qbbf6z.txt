LPT: If you're travelling by plane with another person, split your clothes and put half of each persons clothes into each suitcase. That way if one suitcase is lost en route, you both still have clothing, rather than one person being left with nothing to wear.

For all you doinks thinking I'm suggesting you do this with a with a complete stranger at the airport, take yourself out the room and have a word with yourself because idiocy like that is going to get you killed one day.

For anyone who thinks you need to be the same size etc of the person you're doing this with, just know you have completely missed the point and that your idiocy is dangerous as well. I do this with my SO who is a different sex and a different size to me, the idea being we still wear our own clothes when we're at our destination, just dividing them between cases during travelling in case one case goes missing.

This is literally something completely free that you and your partner/friend/someone else you live with could do so neither of you would end up with no clothes or just one change of clothes you put in your hand luggage/carry on. It would save buying new clothes in a country you may not be familiar with which may also be financially inconvenient. Carry on luggage is also often made to go in the hold so that argument is not valid.

Yes I am aware that luggage going missing is rare but it happens. I have worked at an airport and know people who work at an airport. It happens enough to warrant putting a system in place so that you don't end up without clothes.

You know what, if just one person implements this and it saves them from having to wash skiddies out of their dirty underwear in the sink, I'm happy.
