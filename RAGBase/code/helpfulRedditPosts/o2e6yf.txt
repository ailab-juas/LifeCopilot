YSK just because someone with a wheelchair stands, or even walks a little, doesn’t mean they’re faking it

content:
Why YSK: People making assumptions can be a cause for anxiety for someone already going through something tough. For example, I was in a wheelchair because I had trouble with movement of my legs and walking, but could stand straight up just fine. I’m also really young and would get really strange looks a lot, especially from older people, which would make me super self conscious. 

There are reasons other than being paralyzed that may require use of a wheelchair :) This only came to mind because I saw a post accusing someone faking their illness because they stood up from their wheelchair
