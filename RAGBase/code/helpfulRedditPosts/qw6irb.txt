LPT: If you're picking someone up from the airport, bring a bottle of water for each person.

content:
Snacks or a fast food meal wouldn't hurt either. With the travel season fast approaching, a lot of airlines, especially discount airlines never give you enough to drink. Some airlines will sell you meals for outrageous prices but they are never really a full meal. A traveler might be on a plane for hours (plus getting to the airport early, delays, transfers, layovers and different legs of a trip) with little to drink and peanuts/pretzels won't cut it.
