title:
YSK: Trailer chains need to be crossed when towing

Trailer chains are designed to be crossed.  If the hitch comes off of the ball while driving the crossed chains create a cradle that holds the tongue of the trailer off of the ground.  Straight chains let the tongue hit the pavement at speed and that is a bad thing.
