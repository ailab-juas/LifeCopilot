YSK: No matter how much your workplace pushes "family culture" - remember, they're not your friends and it's still a workplace.

Why YSK: my gf learned this the hard - she worked every hour under the sun for a startup and when she wasn't working would spend evenings with them in a social capacity. She got fired last year due to the company having cash flow issues and all of them stopped responding to her messages. She put so much work into trying to make the company successful and sacrificed other parts of her life for them, but they didn't really give a shit about her. I'm not saying go around and be a dick to people for no reason, but it's better to build relationships outside of work or in places where there aren't any power imbalances or incentives to screw people over.
