LPT: Get the last bit out of the bottle by using a sock centrifuge

content:
I had this brainwave earlier today when the wife was complaining about not being able to get the last smidge of mustard out of the bottle.

So I had a think on it and looked around on google for a condiment centrifuge. All I saw there was a YouTube of someone 3d printing a thing to hook on a drill that made the bottle go flying off in orbit and a rather silly article from the NY Times suggesting you windmill your arm while holding the bottle.

Ok both work, but one isn't really accessible to most of us and the other just makes you look silly while tiring you out. Sure both work, but I'm a Dad. I demand less effort.

After ruminating on it for a bit I recalled an old episode of Mr. Bean in which he used a sock as a salad spinner and I thought,'Huh, most of the bottled things in the fridge will fit in a sock.'

So I dug around my closet for an old crew length sock that no longer had a mate and put the mustard bottle down the sock with the nozzle pointed toward the toe. After a brief bit of twirling it about I checked and lo, the mustard was all down at the nozzle end and I could finally explain to my wife why I had random socks in the kitchen without blaming the toddler.

So now you know how to get that last bit of mustard from the bottle using your sock.
