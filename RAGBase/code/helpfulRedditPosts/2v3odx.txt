YSK that if you're an adult without a record of a childhood measles vaccine, there's a blood test that can check your immunity.

The anti-vaccine people are helping to cause a rebirth of measles in the US. A lot of adults have no idea if they ever got the vaccine.

I dodged a vaccine in 2nd grade. They were giving it out at school and being a kid, I didn't want a shot, so I milled around through the lines and walked out with the kids who had already been vaccinated.

Fast forward a few decades and I had no clue what that shot was for. Found out they can screen for immunity on mumps, rubella, measles, maybe some other stuff to.

Turns out I dodged the measles shot. So they vaccinated me and now I'm good to go, which is nice, considering there's an outbreak in my area.
