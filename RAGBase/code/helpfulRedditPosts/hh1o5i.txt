YSK that when cats have their eyes half closed, we read their facial expression as judgmental, annoyed, or mean, when actually this is an expression of being relaxed and happy!

Cat facial expressions are a lot different from ours. Remember, they haven't gone through nearly as much selective breeding as dogs to be perfect companions to humans, so it's harder for us to relate to and interpret them. And all too often with cats, our assumptions are the opposite of reality.

Cats will only let their eyes rest in that half-closed position when they feel completely safe and trust the people they're with. Of course it's fine to make fun of how serious this can make them look, but just remember that expression is a good sign that your cat is very much enjoying themselves and likes being with you. This is also useful to remember when you're getting to know a cat that seems a bit shy---you may be making more progress than realize!
