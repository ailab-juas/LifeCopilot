YSK how to answer the job interview question "What is your biggest weakness?" Tell them an actual weakness, and then explain how you use it to make you a better worker.

content:
Do not say things like "I work too hard on perfecting each task," or just "I work too hard," and then stop there. An interviewer is looking to see if you know yourself and your own limits.  

Before the interview, sit down and think about this question.  Some of the better examples are;

"Give me a task to do by myself, and I'm fine. However, I don't really work well on group projects, so I've gotten very good at dividing tasks, fairly and evenly."

"Honestly, I'm lazy. But I like to think of my self as intelligently lazy. I have realized that getting the work done efficiently is less work over all than putting off all of the work until the last minute."

"I'm not exactly a fast learner. It sometimes takes me longer than others to learn how to do a task. However, once I understand it, I don't forget it."

Edit: yes, it is a stupid interview question. That doesn't mean that it doesn't get asked.
