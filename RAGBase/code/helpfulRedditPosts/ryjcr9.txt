LPT: take out “that” and “very” to make any writing more concise and make you sound more intelligent

content:
This might be totally irrelevant but I do a lot of writing for my job and thought I would share. 

95% of the time “that” is unnecessary in a sentence and makes your writing wordy. Removing it from a sentence makes your writing more concise and overall more formal. I unintentionally use it all the time and when I take it out during edits it completely changes the tone of the document 

Additionally, “very” is the mark of a lazy writer. E.g. he was very mad vs. he was irate. Crack open a thesaurus! Words are fun!
