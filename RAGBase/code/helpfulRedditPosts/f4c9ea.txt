YSK that, in order to lose weight effectively, you need to maintain desired weight for at least a year

content:
In psychology, there’s a theory called the “Set Point”, which describes your “weight thermostat”. Basically, it is the predetermined weight you should have, which involves genetics, environment, and psychological factors. The Set Point must be kept at any desired weight for a year in order to establish a new Set Point for your body that will be maintained by your now reprogrammed brain. It is especially important to maintain it when losing exercise because your weight, if not monitored, will bounce back and weight will most likely increase than your previous weight.

Just want to say I’m posting this in hopes that many who want to ‘lose weight’ as a New Years resolution or just a goal in general may find this helpful. My mom is currently trying to do so, as well as other family members and I’m afraid they don’t understand they can eat more once they have their desired weight. Anyway, good luck
