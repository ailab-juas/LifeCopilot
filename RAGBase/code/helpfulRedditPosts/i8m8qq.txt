LPT : Rule of 2. Pick up two things every time you enter a room, leave your car, etc.

content:
 I know this may sound really dumb and simple but I swear this has changed my life. I used to be disorganized and messy but simply adhering to a principle of picking up two things every time I enter a room has completely changed me. Picking up two things adds up quick and if you stick to this your house will be fully clean in no time.

This taught me a valuable lesson that being clean is not about waiting until everything gets messy to clean it, its about living a clean lifestyle. I now understand how clean people are clean, they simply are literally always cleaning. The best way to be clean and organized is to incorporate cleaning into your lifestyle. There's no need to take time away from your day to clean simply adhere to this rule and you will quickly see how easy it is to incorporate cleaning into your daily lifestyle.

Enter my room, pick up two pieces of clothes. Enter my kitchen, put away a couple dry dishes. Leave my car and take two pieces of trash with me. No overwhelming three hour cleans just an incredibly simple and easy commitment. I don't even think about it anymore. Once I run out of things to clean I find myself organizing my closet, kitchen, going out of my way to improve my life in little ways. I started doing this two years ago and it has changed my life.
