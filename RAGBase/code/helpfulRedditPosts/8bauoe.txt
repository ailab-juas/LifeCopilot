LPT: If someone in your group of friends is generally the go to person for advice or to vent to, please take time to ask them if they're ok. Even if they always seem positive/upbeat.

If they're anything like me, they are really good at putting on a happy face and are not good at asking for help when they need it. This has been a really rough month and I realized today that I'm really good at hiding that fact. Someone just complimented me on always being so positive, though right now on the inside I feel like I'm drowning in sorrow.

Edit: Wow, this really blew up, I really did not expect that. I sincerely appreciate everyone who responded, reading through these has eased my mind a bit. Also thank you kind stranger for my first reddit gold! 

To those of you who asked if I'm ok; Tbh not really but I will be. The darkness in my mind waxes and wanes and yesterday was a bit heavier than I'm used to, probably due to pain that's been keeping me from sleeping well the past month. I'm working on getting better at asking for help and expressing how I truly feel all the time, not just when I'm happy. I'd explain more of what I'm going through but I have a hard enough time doing that with friends, as this post has gotten much more attention than I was expecting I'll just say that I'm working on getting better one day at a time. 

Again thank you all, none of you are truly alone in this. Be kind to one another and yourselves. ~~Even~~  Especially the ones that seem mean spirited or grumpy, they often are just projecting and need it just a much.

I'm at work now so I'll try to respond to as many of you as I can this evening. Most likely through your inbox.
