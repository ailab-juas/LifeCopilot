YSK It is highly unethical for someone to appraise an item for you and then make an offer to buy it. They are likely attempting to swindle you out of a lot of money. If that happens, be sure to go get an appraisal from someone else

Whether it's Jewelry, Art, Property, or whatever it may be, it is unethical for someone to give you an appraisal and then immediately offer to buy it from you. That's a giant red flag that you should go to someone else for an appraisal, perhaps even getting multiple appraisals from different unrelated sources.

Why YSK: They could be giving you a knowingly very low appraisal so they can sell it themselves and make a lot of money off of you. For example: You bring in your Grandpa's old Gold Watch to get appraised, the appraiser appraises the item for $1,200, knowing it's worth closer to $10,000. You feel pretty good about having $1,200 in your pocket, but you just got swindled out of $8,800. You poor sap. What would your Grandpa think of you? He'd probably say "You damn fool! That was a Rolex! You just got flim-flammed!"...or something along those lines.

For really expensive items, it's a good idea to get multiple appraisals anyways, but if any appraiser turns around and makes an offer, you should run in the opposite direction. It's also easier than ever to research items you own that may be of value, thanks to the Internet. By doing 20mins to an hour of research online, you could find out everything you need to know about any potentially valuable item you may have and get a rough estimate of it's worth. You may also not find any info on the item you are looking for, but it's worth try. 

Shout out to Antiques Roadshow who often educates viewers on this unethical practice of appraising something and then making and offer on it.
