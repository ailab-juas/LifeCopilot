LPT: If you want to stop vaping donâ€™t try to stop, just start buying the most disgusting flavor possible.

content:
Even if you never stop, hitting it half as much (probably even less) as you used to is already way better for you. And you'll be using it less so you'll slowly be less addicted and you'll also start becoming grossed out by it.

The next step is to just keep it somewhere inconvenient instead of on your person. Like at home put it on top of a counter or in your car the back seat. Knowing that you can hit a vape any time you want makes you crave it SO MUCH LESS, half the trouble of quitting is craving nicotine but not
having any. Knowing you have some takes that entire problem away, and if you really need your fix you can go hit the caramel tobacco posh that
you put on top of your fridge. But I guarantee you're not going to be hitting it all day, you'll grab it a few times a day for a few puffs. That is
like 90% better. 

And then eventually you'll hit a point where stopping is actually doable.

I did this just to vape less and ended up quitting within a few months after four years of vaping. And stopped for over a year. I'll still vape if I'm drunk and everyone around me is hitting one, but that's it.

Don't focus on quitting, just focus on doing it less. Maybe you do fully quit, maybe now you just hardly ever do it, either way you'll feel so much better and so much healthier.
