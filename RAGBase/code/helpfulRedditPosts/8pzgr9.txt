title:
YSK when you are leaving a voicemail that's going downhill fast that you can rerecord it unlimited times!

content:
This has been a lifesaver at my job. You can also listen to your voicemail or even abandon ship all together and delete it.

Rerecord: # or * (depending on the carrier, but a prompt will tell you so just try both)

Listen to the voicemail: 2 (if nothing happens, # then 2)

Delete: 3 (if nothing happens, # then 3)
