LPT: At a college and locked your keys in you car? Call security before a you call a locksmith.

content:
The community colleges and universities around my area have slim jims on hand and may be able to help before having to pay for a locksmith. Might be worth a shot to ask. 

Edit: I get it: back up set of keys with a friend or at home is great. AAA is great. Calling a tow truck guy is great. Calling the cops is great. Campus (and now I've learned Hospital) security is minutes away and will help if they can. It's worth trying before you decide to wait it out and/or spend money with the other option. 

Like I said, worth a shot.

Edit2: also, sorry for the atrocious mistakes in the title

TIL: don't help
