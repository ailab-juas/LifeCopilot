YSK All 1500W heaters put out the exact same amount of heat, and consume the exact same amount of electricity, regardless of physical size, or the properties of the heating element.

Why YSK: If you're buying a new space heater, consider that the small, inexpensive, 1500W heater with the wire heating element will put out just as much heat as the big, costly, oil-filled, 1500W heater. If you buy the smaller heater, you'll still get the same amount of heat, using the same amount of electricity as the larger heater, while saving money.

The First Law of Thermodynamics (aka The Law of Conservation of Energy) cannot be broken, and you should not allow advertising and packaging to convince you otherwise.

Features to actually consider when purchasing a heater:

A fan; forcing the air to move through the heater will help circulate the heat better throughout the room.

The thermostat (or lack thereof) and its accuracy; digital thermostats tend to be more accurate, and easier to interpret.

A timer, for automatic shutoff.
