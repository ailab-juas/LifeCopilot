LPT: The better shape you keep yourself in, the better you will weather traumatic events. When work/life gets hard, make sure you do your best to keep yourself fit.

content:
Science shows that the fitter you are, the less likely you are to develop PTSD symptoms if you experience something traumatic (like getting fired*).

In other words, when work gets hard, make sure you also get to the gym. Worst case scenario, you get fired. But youâ€™ll be able to better process the event and move on, rather than suffering from nightmares, panic attacks, and recollections that hold you hostage.

\*Obviously everyone has their own version of trauma.
