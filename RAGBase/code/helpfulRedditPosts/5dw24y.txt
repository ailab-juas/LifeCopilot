LPT: Melted paracord makes a good epoxy if you need a quick fix.

content:
One of the things I always do with it is seal any knots I make in the cord with some of the melted resin off of the end I cut, but the applications are endless! If you get some nice black paracord you'll have both the strong, thin rope and a white and black adhesive to repair or seal all sorts of stuff. 

I've found that it works well for closing off thread seams and tears too so keep it in mind the next time you go backpacking. Just finished repairing my jeans with it too. 

This isn't exactly the life coaching type of tip you normally see here but I definitely think it'll help out. Happy melting!

EDIT: The post that doubled my karma is about melting rope and rubbing it on stuff. Don't ever change Reddit.
