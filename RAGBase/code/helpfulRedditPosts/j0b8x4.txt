title:
YSK stopping in the middle of the road to let a pedestrian, especially a child, cross at an unmarked crossing is one of the most life threatening things a driver can do to a pedestrian.

content:
Why YSK: although well meaning, drivers who do this put the pedestrian in grave risk. You and the pedestrian are the only people who know what you are doing, and what you are doing goes against law and convention. Other drivers may think you have stalled, are lost, perhaps taking a call on your phone, or a whole host of assumed circumstances. 

They go around you and the pedestrian gets hit. And it is your fault that pedestrian was hit, especially if you waved them through.

This is especially true on 4 lane roads.

DO not stop. The pedestrian can take a chance jaywalking or going to a properly marked crosswalk

EDIT: 
- c'mon guys, I said "middle of the road" in the title to eliminate intersections, which are often unmarked crosswalks..
- also, do NOT stop and wave pedestrians to cross, DO stop for pedestrians who have already started across the road. Please do not use this post to justify smoking someone.
