YSK that if you're doing the Trash Tag challenge, don't dig up the trash with your bare hands. There can be a lot of used needles and syringes.

[This blogger](https://waterisaright.com/trashtag-challenge/) did the trash challenge and found out that a lot of people are throwing needles and other medical waste along with their trash. Even if you use thick gloves, the needles can puncture through latex and plastic (trash bags) so always use a pick up stick or a shovel.
