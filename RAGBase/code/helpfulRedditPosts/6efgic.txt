LPT: do housework 30 minutes every day with a timer

content:
If you have trouble getting motivated to clean, make it a habit of setting a timer as soon as you get home and use that time to clean, either small tasks like wiping down the kitchen or larger tasks like organizing paperwork. No matter what, when the timer goes off, you're done. You can enjoy the rest of your night without feeling guilty or feeling you wasted it procrastinating. 

Pretty soon you'll get into the routine and your house will always look great. If you need to take baby steps, start with just 15, or broaden your definition of housework to include things like creating a grocery list, planning some meals, or tending some plants.
