title:
LPT: The correct phrases/spellings are "sleight of hand," "toe the line," and "en route."

content:
Not "slight", "tow" and "on" or "in." I genuinely see these written down incorrectly far more frequently than I see them written correctly. Even a lot of people with excellent written communication skills seem to be unaware of the correct versions of these.

Edit: Per se, lo and behold, free rein. Not say, low and reign.
