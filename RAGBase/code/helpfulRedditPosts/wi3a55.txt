LPT: When you move, fill a laundry basket with things youâ€™ll need as soon as you get to your new place but may not otherwise be able to find easily. Pack this basket LAST and put it in your car or the front seat of the moving van.

content:
Include items like toilet paper, paper towels, hand sanitizer, paper plates, plastic ware, scissors, box cutters, dish soap, hand soap, hand towels, phone chargers, Clorox wipes, etc. I also have each family member pack a suitcase full of their clothing, toiletries, laptops, a bath towel, medications, contacts, etc. These should also be packed last and placed in your car.
