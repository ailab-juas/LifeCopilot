YSK if your wipers are on, your headlights should be on too.

content:
If you are driving and it’s rainy enough to use your windshield wipers, you should make sure your vehicle’s headlights are on too.

It’s not just about how well you can see, but how well others can see you.

And if someone flashes their brights at you, they could be trying to tell you to check your lights.

**This the law in some US states** but not everywhere. It’s still the safe thing to do. [https://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/headlight-use/](https://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/headlight-use/)

Edit: some people have mentioned this in the comments but in case you missed it, day/running lights on a car do NOT turn on your tail lights. You need to turn on the full head lights on your vehicle if it isn’t already automatic for you for better visibility from both the front and back!

Edit #2: Added bolding to the part several comments are repeating
