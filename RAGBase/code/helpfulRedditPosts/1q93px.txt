LPT: Need to get the gross stuff out of your sink/bath drain?

content:
Take a straw, cut some grooves in it with scissors like so and stick it down that drain! When you pull it up it'll have all the hairs and scum and other shit attached to it.

EDIT: My bad, make sure the grooves actually [go downward](http://imgur.com/FtmJfWc) so when you pull the straw back up all the stuff snags onto it.
