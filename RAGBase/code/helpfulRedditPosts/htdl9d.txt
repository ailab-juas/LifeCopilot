title:
YSK how you preform the heimlich manuver on a choking toddler or baby.

content:
 If a choking infant can no longer breathe, cough, or make sounds, tell someone to call 911 immediately or dial yourself and place on speaker while you help them. Next, place the baby face down on your forearm. Your arm should be resting on your thigh. With the heel of your other hand, give the child five quick, forceful blows between the shoulder blades. If this fails, turn the infant on their back so that the head is lower than the chest. Place two fingers in the center middle of the breast bone, just below the nipples. Press inward rapidly five times. Continue this sequence of five back blows and five chest thrusts until the foreign object comes out or until the infant passes out. If the infant passes out, tell 911 immediately. **Never put your fingers into the infant's mouth unless you can see the object. Doing so may push the blockage farther into the airway.**

Adults have straight windpipes that can eject food relatively easily if the adult heimlich is performed properly. Slapping an adult on the back will help them dislodge partially stuck food, but if the food is fully blocking the airway, you'll have to do the heimlich maneuver on them. You'll be able to tell if the adult of child is able to cough, or make a little noise. If they can't do either of those things, the food is firmly lodged in their windpipe.  You should avoid slapping an Infant or toddler's back when you think they may be choking. Children have funnel shaped windpipes that will force food further down to become firmly lodged when they're sitting up if you slap their backs, instead of sending it out so they can breathe again.

If you talk to your fire company they probably have a list of instructors and or classes you can reach out to and attend; this goes for anyone-reach out to your local fire/EMS organizations and they should be able to get you set up!
