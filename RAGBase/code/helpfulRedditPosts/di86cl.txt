title:
YSK - If you have concerns about a person considering suicide, you should ask them outright "are you thinking of committing suicide?" Why? Asking does not increase the likelihood of an attempt and it allows a moment where an intervention (by yourself or others/professionals) can begin.

content:
Evidence shows that asking this question doesn't increase the likelihood of someone attempting to commit suicide. But it does allow a moment where the topic can be expressed. You will likely do no harm by asking them the question and it might just save their life. Citing a well established training group which specialises in teaching people to be more informed/able to intervene in moments of suicidal attempt. See the goup below. Also citing the NIMH (see second link)
