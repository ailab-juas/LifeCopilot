YSK if you want to register for a class that is full, *attend the class anyway* while you wait for spots to open up.

content:
If you don't attend the class from the beginning, you are missing important information about how the class is run, what it will be about, and most importantly, what is expected of you. Knowing what's expected of you is important for getting decent grades in a time-efficient manner. 

It also happens occasionally that after students attend the first couple classes they decide they're not actually interested, it's too hard, too easy, or they just don't like the prof. Investing this little bit of time scoping out a class before you register can save you from wasting a semester/quarter/trimester on a class you're not into, or having a Drop/Withdrawn/F on your transcript.
