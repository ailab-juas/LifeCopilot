[LPT] Don't have a particular store's reward card?

content:
If using a phone number is an option, try using your local area code, and Jenny's phone number. A lot of people are reluctant to put their real phone number, and 867-5309 has worked in almost every store I have tried it in. Discounts are good! 

ETA: *Jenny* is just the name of the Tommy Tutones song that I got the number from. I did not realize so many people would be unfamiliar with the song. Sorry.
