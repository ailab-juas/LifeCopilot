LPT: If you're ever stressed out or sad, exercise, you'll feel 100x better

content:
I know senior year when I was really upset one day I just decided to go out for a run without thinking about it and I felt immensely better. Since then working out has always become an outlet, and a healthy one at that.

edit: It's not limited to running or being in a gym but could be walking, cycling, swimming, indoor rock climbing, etc.
