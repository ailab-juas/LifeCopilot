LPT- Have a child that is a picky eater? Have them start preparing meals with you and choosing what you will eat. Some children want to try the things they make and are more open to giving it a chance, when they’ve been involved in the process.

My four year old would eat macaroni every meal if you let her. Lately I’ve been having her cook with me, letting her choose between three options on what we should cook,  and letting her help me with the clean up. In this past month she had tried so many new foods i would have never imagined and has even declared a few new favorites. I’m floored. You should really see the pride in her eyes when we give her a compliment on her cooking. Highly recommend it and hope you have the same results I’ve had.


Edit: it’s been great chatting with you guys. I’m on the other side of the world, so it’s getting late here. If i didn’t make it clear, i chose the meals for the week and then she gets to pick from two or three of those options. So many people have mentioned getting their kids involved with gardening. I highly recommend it. It’s not as hard as you think. Raised beds are great for things like carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, and herbs.

Many people have commented that kids shouldn’t have a choice, and while i respect your opinion, our family just doesn’t work like that. We value each other’s opinion and i want my daughter to feel heard and valued. I want her to have a healthy relationship with food.

Lastly, if this of a repost, my bad! I literally thought i was on to something and just wanted to share with my fellow parents. I’ve had a few things reposted in the past that made it to the front and it hurt a little, but also made me proud. 

Hope you guys have a wonderful week. Thanks for everyone who chimed in and muchas gracias for the awards.
