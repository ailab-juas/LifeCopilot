LPT: Tell random friends nice things here and there about the small stuff.

content:
Every once in a while or even once a day. If you have a social network account go play friends list roulette and pick one at random and compliment them on a recent accomplishment or how healthy they are looking, anything kind, and tell them to have a great day. It keeps good vibes going out, and most of the time when you do that, the person will say something nice back and those words exchanged may brighten both of your days substantially. It also keeps you in touch with people which is nice too! Just be positive!

EDIT: I'm not saying be a cheese-dick with the compliments (I have some examples in the comments that I personally said), I'm saying be sincere, don't just say congratulations on your recent acheivement, or you look great! Add in sentiment that is circumstantial to the basis of the friendship you have with whom you are complimenting. ALSO, DON'T DO THIS FOR ANY SORT OF GAIN, DO IT, AND EXPECT NOTHING IN RETURN. Just compliment them in hopes you brighten their day, nothing more. More may come out of it, but don't expect it.
