title:
LPT if someone you know has Alzheimer's... put together a memory box for them

content:
I got the idea from [here](http://www.pictureproud.co.uk/memory-boxes-perfect-gift-dementia-alzheimers-patients). My grandma had Alzheimer's during the final years of her life... and I wish I would've thought of this. 

Alzheimer's or Dementia sufferers will forget recent events, and have a hard time making decisions, or doing more than one thing at a time. Over time, they lose interest in things previously enjoyed, forget what their loved ones look like, and have trouble remembering the names of familiar objects. 

The idea is to put together a photo album, scrapbook, or box, of all the things they used to enjoy. Leave it somewhere it won't get lost, like a coffee table. Going through the photographs and keepsakes will help bring back memories and can be a good conversation starter, and will let them keep their sense of self.
