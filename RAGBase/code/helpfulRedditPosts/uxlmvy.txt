YSK: Celebrities wear wigs

content:
Every wonder why celebritiesâ€™ hair looks thick, voluminous, and perfect at events? Or why, despite dozens of color changes and bleaches that it never looks damaged or thinned out?

Well now you know! Celebrities wear wigs! A family friend is a hair dresser for celebrities in LA and I was surprised to know that the majority of celebrities don wings for events, tv shows, and appearances. 

Why YSK : No reason to feel bad about your hair- everything about Hollywood is fake! Many people have thinning or damaged hair, and the perfectly styled and thick hair you see on tv is not real. Love your hair!
