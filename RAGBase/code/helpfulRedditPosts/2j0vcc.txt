LPT: To make a mixed drink seem stronger, rub the rim with the alcohol used

When serving drinks, just rub the rim of a drink with alcohol. This will make the first thing you taste and smell be the pure alcohol and make it seem like the drink is much stronger than it is.

My brother taught me this trick to keep rowdy family members from getting too drunk too fast. It works wonders!

Bonus: Tell the drink receiver to "watch out, it's very strong" and they'll likely  take a sniff of the drink before drinking - smelling mostly pure alcohol. They will also be aware that they're drinking a "strong" drink and hopefully pace themselves.
