LPT: If you have a college ID, ask every place you buy something if they have a student discount. Most places that do won’t advertise it.

content:
I work at a store in a college town and we don’t advertise our student discount because we would lose money by advertising it, but if people ask we still give it to them.

Edit:

This post has gotten a lot of attention, just a few more important notes:

• there are apps (like UNiDAYS) that tell you what places offer student discounts 
• it also doesn’t hurt to ask whenever you initially enter a store “what discounts do you have”
• always check the current signage in the store. My store is plastered all over with signs about what sales we have going on at the time but I’ll mention our sales to someone and they’ll be surprised (as they didn’t read the signage)
