LPT: My piano teacher told me it's always better to practice 20 minutes every day at a skill rather than 60 minutes every 3 or so days.

This has helped me, at least. Especially if I set a timer aside. It sticks with me longer and I find I improve that much faster if I set aside time every day for what I want to get better at.

EDIT: 20 minutes was just an example. If you want to practice an hour a day, do so. It's better to practice an hour a day vs 3 every 3 days. Its the frequency not so much the time.
