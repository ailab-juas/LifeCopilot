LPT: If there’s a phone alarm that someone else sets on their phone, but doesn’t turn off at an appropriate time, just call their phone and it will shut the alarm off.

My wife is notorious for setting alarms on her phone and then getting in the shower while her phone sits on the counter. I’m trying to get a couple extra minutes of sleep and her alarm will go off. One day I realized I can just call her phone and it will disrupt the alarm! This avoids having to get out of bed to turn it off. 

Edit: I apologize that this isn’t working for all makes and models of phones. This was on iOS device. 

Also wanted to clarify that my wife is not doing this to be inconsiderate. While she is consistent with this behavior, she is rarely awake before me so it’s not a common occurrence and so I typically forget to say something especially now that I’ve been using this method. 

Thank you for the gold! I hope people genuinely benefit from this tip!
