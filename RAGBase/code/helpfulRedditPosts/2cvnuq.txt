LPT: Check your credit report for free once per year on all three credit bureaus at and dispute any negative or potentially negative items.

content:
Here's how it works, the creditor has 30 days to respond. If they do not, the item will be deleted or the account updated. I was shocked to find I was reported for creditor mishaps which I thought had been resolved. I disputed them a month ago and today I had an email saying that everything I disputed was either deleted from my record or updated from a negative status. It's easy, it's free, and your credit is your life these days. Do it NOW!
