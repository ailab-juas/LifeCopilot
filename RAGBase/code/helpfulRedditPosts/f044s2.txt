LPT: If you want to love what you do, start first with what makes you thrive. Don’t know what makes you thrive? Find what makes you angry.

So often career coaches tell people to “find what makes them thrive” or to “find a career that they love.”  This is generally bad advice for people as most individuals don’t know what it means to thrive or how to get out of the “working for a paycheck” mentality.  

Telling people to find a career doing what they love is equally useless... because many don’t know how to monetize that.

Want to help yourself (and others) find a career doing what you love?  Better advice is to find out what makes you MAD AS HELL and start there.  Why?  Because anger is passion and passion is energy.  If you care about something enough to get angry about it then it matters to you... and you’ll probably be willing to invest your time into doing something about it.  From there the challenge becomes how to monetize it (get paid for it) but at least you are starting from a place of passion vs. a paycheck.

In today’s world, especially with men, feelings of happiness are foreign and what “makes us thrive” is elusive.  Conversely, anger is an easy emotion and one we are all allowed to feel.  It’s just a different way of getting at the same thing and often offers an easier and clearer path.

Happy journeying and best of luck.
