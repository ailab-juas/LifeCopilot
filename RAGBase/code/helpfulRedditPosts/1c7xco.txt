LPT: Taking a cooler on a long trip? Freeze a case of water bottles and pack them around your food, instead of using ice cubes or refreezable packs. As they melt, you'll have fresh cold drinking water. +8 cooler tips inside.

content:
Doing this keeps your food drier since you won't have ice melting into a pool of water, and you're not wasting space with ice packs that you can't eat or drink. If you'll be staying somewhere with a freezer during your trip, save the bottles to refill and refreeze.

Normal plastic water bottles won't explode when they freeze because they are built to expand. If you use a different kind of bottle (plastic milk jugs work well), make sure you leave some air space to allow for ice expansion. Don't use glass bottles; there's a breakage risk and they're heavy.

Some people worry about carcinogens or other toxins from freezing or using plastic water bottles.

Other tips:

1. **For some cool drinking water at the start of your trip**, freeze some half-full bottles and then fill them up with cold water just before you put them in the cooler.

2. **Make sure you pre-chill all the food** before you put it in the cooler. If your food can be frozen without affecting the quality (milk, most soups, chilis, etc.) and you won't need it right away, freeze it. You can freeze juice boxes. Don't freeze canned beverages or foods.

3. If you have a large chest freezer with enough room, **freeze your entire cooler** for a few hours before loading it. If your freezer isn't that big, you can pre-cool your cooler putting some ice in it for 6+ hours. Dump out the meltwater and dry it out, then load it up.

4. **Pack related items together inside a large ziplock bag**, such as condiments or sandwich ingredients, or everything you'll need for a certain meal. That way it's easier to find everything you need quickly so the cooler is open for shorter times, and the food will stay drier. Throw in a few extra bags to store leftovers. Foods that come in a "resealable" package will probably not stay dry if they get submerged in meltwater once they've been opened; put them in a ziplock bag.

5. **Keep your cooler out of the sun, and don't leave it in a hot vehicle** if you can safely store it somewhere else. If it does have to stay in the sun or a vehicle, cover it with a blanket, towel, or reflective emergency blanket. (If you're camping, don't leave your cooler in your tent or outside. Hungry animals and/or people will show up.)

6. **Keep a thermometer in your cooler.** Your food should stay below the "[danger zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_zone_\(food_safety\))" temperature of 5°C / 41°F. Foods that are potentially hazardous if they spend two or more hours in the danger zone are: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, protein rich foods, dairy products, cut or peeled fresh produce, most cooked foods, shellfish, sauces and gravies, sprouts, and any foods that contain any of these items.

7. If you need your cooler to stay cold longer, and/or to stay cold enough to keep things frozen, **find a dry ice distributor** in your area. (Regular ice will *not* keep things frozen.) Wrap the dry ice block in a towel and put it in your cooler. Be careful when handling dry ice; it's not toxic but if you touch it you will have a bad time.

8. Plastic **egg carrier cases** work well, but they take up a lot of space even when they're almost empty. (Two small carriers is better than one large one!) A cardboard egg carton inside a plastic bag is fine as long as you're careful not to crush it, and if space is needed you can cut off the unused cells. Hard-boiled eggs can be pre-peeled and kept in a ziplock bag. If you're making scrambled eggs, pre-mix them and put them in a tight-sealing container or wide-mouth bottle. It is possible to freeze eggs too, but [with some preparation](https://www.google.com/search?q=freeze+raw+eggs).
