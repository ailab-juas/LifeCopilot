Edit to state states that require a prescription:

“CVS has a list: you still need a prescription in Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. According to a spokesperson, all of their stores stock it or can order it for the next business day.

A Walgreens spokesperson said that their stores require a prescription under state law in Delaware, Hawaii, and Wyoming; they don’t have any stores in North Dakota.”
