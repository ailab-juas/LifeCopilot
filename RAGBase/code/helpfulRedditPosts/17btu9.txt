title:
LPT: Unblock nose, alleviate breathing difficulties

content:
I cannot find the original site that I read this but it works for me.

Take a deep breath then exhale completely. Now, without breathing in at all, slowly tilt your head up, then down, repeatedly. Stop the tilting and resume normal breathing **only** when the urge to breathe again is overwhelming.

I find that I can now breathe through both nostrils, unblock a stuffy nose or my chest is not so tight from my slight asthma.

This procedure seems to force your body to open all airways fully.
