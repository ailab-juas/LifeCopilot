LPT: How to properly clean your ears (aka no Q-tips)

content:
As explained by the nurse who removed excessive amounts of earwax from my ears after not being able to hear on one side:
 
While in the shower, put your ear up to the shower head and allow the water to blast into your ear.  This water will be coming in too fast to actually get stuck in your ear and cause an ear infection.  Then when drying off with your towel, take the corner of your towel, fold it in half and then use that tip the same way as you would use a q-tip. The difference being is that the towel is too thick to penetrate the ear to sensitive areas.

**tl;dr** blast ears with water from shower. Use corner of towel as a q-tip

**EDIT:** As you probably guessed from me using the world “blast” I am no doctor. This is just advice I have gained through life experience as with many of the tips found in this subreddit. The difference with this one being that it's more health oriented.  With that said this advice should be taken with a grain of salt.  What you should do I listen to a professional aka your doctor.

There have also been a couple quality comments that can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/13emto/lpt_how_to_properly_clean_your_ears_aka_no_qtips/c73e11c) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/13emto/lpt_how_to_properly_clean_your_ears_aka_no_qtips/c73h8uq).  The general consensus seems to be to not use q-tips.
