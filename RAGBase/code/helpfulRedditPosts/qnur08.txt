LPT: You are not required to speak with anyone in public who tries to speak with you.

content:
Another recent quasi-LPT tried to make LPT around a hyper specific situation related to a tv/internet sales associate in their own store. 

But as a broader rule of thumb, you do not have to speak with ANYONE that you do not know who comes up to you in public. This includes sales folks, panhandlers, homeless people, random strangers, creeps, etc.

Sure you should validate others existence, but for the ladies especially, you are not required to even look at someone trying to speak with you or make a comment to you.

Just because you are in public doesnâ€™t mean you have to engage with anyone who tries.
