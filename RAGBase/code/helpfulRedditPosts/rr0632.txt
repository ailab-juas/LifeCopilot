YSK: your bank is a better place than a CoinStar to turn your change into something usable.

content:
Why YSK: I understand the convenience of the machines in Walmart, but if you are a member of a bank or credit union also in your neighborhood, they shouldn’t charge a fee to count your coins with a machine and either deposit them or give you cash. CoinStar either charges a percentage or forces you to get a gift card at the store you’re in.

Edit:
Wow, apparently there are a lot of banks who just don’t do this anymore, or still charge a fee or require you to submit them in rollers. This tells me we as a society have decided change isn’t worth it and should stop wasting money at the mint on anything under a quarter. 
Also, it sounds like CoinStar offers a lot of gift card options like Amazon with no fee. Not bad if you shop there anyway.
