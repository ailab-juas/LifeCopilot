LPT: You can reset a bad day and start being productive again by following these 7 steps

content:
If you're also an 'all-or-nothing' person like me, every day, week, year is either good or bad. You're either super productive and getting everything done, or lying in bed for hours scrolling, telling yourself **'I ruined it anyway, I'll start tomorrow'.**

For the past months I've been getting more and more disciplined , and still once in a while comes a bad day.

Bad days are the ones that simply go wrong from the get go. Everything and everyone is annoying, and you slowly lose all of your mood and motivation, stop the work/ study that you're doing and just get distracted.

If you are also addicted to something, **this is the point where you'll feel the need to have your substance**\- to smoke, to eat some chocolate or pizza, to have a drink, to play one round of your favorite game, (or in my case- watch an endless stream of videos). I learned the hard way that this act is what destroys the day completely because after the belly is completely loaded with snacks , or the eyes are dizzy from all the games and videos, it becomes impossible to get back on track.

Also, If part of your self improvement route includes trying to quit your addiction, this moment put all of your efforts at risk, as you're thinking something like "well this day is a mess anyway, it's ruined, I'll get back at it tomorrow'

But there's a way to stop this mindset, and you can consider at least giving it a try

***How to restart and turn around a bad day in 7 steps:***

If you're at home :

As soon as you're realizing you're in the bad day, stop what your'e doing immediately, and do the following, in this order:

1. **Cold water;** Stand up. Go and wash your face with cold water. Brush your teeth. Look at yourself in the mirror and say , either out loud or in your head "I am starting over"
2. **Energy boost;** Do 20 jumping jacks / 5 pushups / 3 climbs up and down stairs; Just a small physical activity to raise your heart rate and bring you energy.
3. **One successful task;** Make a small , simple task that needs to be completed at home. Something like making your bad, putting some dirty clothes at the laundry rack, washing one dirty dish. It has to be short and simple- do not turn it into a long distraction of cleaning your entire house to avoid working/ studying. Just do this one thing. It can help you feel that you are already switching the day up doing something productive, without wasting much time.
4. **Different outfit;** Go to your closet and change your shirt. A different outfit can help you feel like a new day is starting.
5. **A nice drink;** Go and make yourself a nice non-alcoholic beverage that you can drink while working or studying - something quick as coffee, tea, lemonade etc.
6. **Clear starting point;** Sit down with your beverage and decide what is the specific thing you will do now. Say it to yourself before you touch the computer or the books. "I will reply to my inbox now " , "I will read chapter 7"
7. **Let's go! :)**

If you're in the office / library / school , you can do some switches:

2. Take a quick walk around your building or do some stretches at the bathroom if there's no other choice.

3. Make a small task that is easy and simple such as cleaning your screen.

I hope this helps! i've been doing these steps many times in the last months (each time changing it up until I reached this ideal combo)
