LPT: If your parents are still around, next birthday ask them to write down their life story. I did it this year for both parents and they were the two best presents I've ever received

content:
As the children of parents we have a very one way relationship. We see our parents as parents, not people. And for most of childhood that is essentially a service role - they do things for you, you take things from them.

I'm now in my 30s and I realized I only knew a few select moments in both of their lives before I existed. A couple of highlights, but nothing that really painted a picture about how they came to be the people they were as adults. 

So a couple of years ago I asked them both to write down their story for my birthday. Of course, this was a difficult request for them - getting me some socks or a couple of books feels way more comfortable. But I pushed them on it, helped manage their expectations and made it clear I wasn't expecting Ulysses, and stood firm on the request. 

One year later and my birthday comes around again and this time I got the presents I asked for. Instantly read them cover to cover (I mean, one was 4 pages typed up, and the other was a small handwritten book, so it didn't take too long for either of us), and they were so amazing. So much stuff I didn't know about them both. And not just events, but feelings, attitudes, perspectives, and insight into them both as people rather than just parents.

So this is my LPT to you. I am lucky enough to still have both of my parents, but quite a lot of my peers do not, and it really makes me appreciate that I still have the time to do this. If you are in a similar position then I promise you, you will never have a better birthday present than finding out who your parents were before you threw their life into chaos.
