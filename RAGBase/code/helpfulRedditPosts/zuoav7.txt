LPT: If you are hurting this year for money and you don't have a lot for your kids for Christmas/holidays, hide what the gifts you have, make a treasure hunt with clues and riddles, and stretch it out to give them a great experience.

My kids start with a stocking riddle and it leads them to the next clue hidden in the house and possibly a present. I've been doing this for a few years now and they look forward to the hunt more than the gifts. Thankfully I'm in a much better place financially, but its so much fun for them they ask me to do it every year.

Happy holidays everyone!
