LPT: When online shopping, begin the check out process but do not complete it. The website will send you coupons to encourage the sale.

This works especially well for clothing sites. When filling out your information, put an email address down that you don't mind getting a shit ton of emails on, and continue with your business. Within a couple days, the site will end up sending you an email with a coupon for your shopping cart to encourage you to checkout. Its usually only 10-15%, but it covers a bit of the cost.
I don't think it works on amazon, but it should work on apparel sites.

Edit: I made it to the front page! Thank you guys! This is a huge procomplishment. Happy shopping out there. ALSO I understand this will not work on every site, I've mentioned that here before, but it will work for most apparel sites.
