YSK that asking someone to help you move is different from asking someone to help you pack.

Why YSK:

When you ask someone to help you move, you should have your house clean and fully packed. That way they can help you move boxes and stuff, drive to the new place, help you unload, etc.

These people are generally not paid and are doing you a huge nightmare of a favor. Making them help you clean and/or pack your house is a terrible thing to do, unless you specifically tell them you need help *packing*.
