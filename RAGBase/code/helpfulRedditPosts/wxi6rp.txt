YSK A third of student loan borrowers had less than $10k owed. Pell grants were specifically given to low income borrowers. And the higher the debt someone owes, the more likely they are to repay it.

Why YSK: The new student forgiveness plan is leaving edit: **52%** of borrowers completely forgiven, and was designed to give extra help to low income borrowers. 

Great video by Hank Green on the subject:

Now my editorial take: People who are crapping on this plan because it won't help their 100k debt are the ones who statistically benefited from student loans as they were meant to. 

Debt that high can't be garnered without having successfully completed at least one undergrad degree. 

The people most impacted by the extra payment every month were people who (for various pitfalls of economic class) were not able to complete their degrees. Meaning they did not benefit from this debt that was both inescapable and disproportionately targeted at them. 

Yes college has become insanely expensive and someone shouldn't have to be $300,000 in debt to become a doctor. But I'm just not letting those situations ruin the first piece of good news I've felt since November 2020.


Edit: I also want to add Incase anyone was like me and told unsubsidized loans meant private loans. 

They aren't the same thing. **All Stafford direct loans are federal loans and qualify for forgiveness. Subsidized or unsubsidized.**

Edit 2: The forgiveness applies to direct consolidated loans.
