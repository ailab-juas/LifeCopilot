LPT: When Kids ask "Why...?"

content:
Kids are inquisitive and I fully encourage everyone to take time and fully answer their questions with as much real information as possible (or applicable, given their age). However, at some point, they will continue to ask "Why?" even when the answers are right in front of them. To avoid getting caught in the "Why?" trap, try this little trick. I've used it with my own kids, kids from the neighborhood, kids on my soccer team, etc.   
When a child asks "Why?" about something they most likely already know the answer to, they are seeking attention or validation (or they are bored and you are entertaining them). So when they ask "Why?" I always respond with this question: "Can you tell me 2 reasons you think could be the answer?" As long as you don't do it in a condescending or challenging manner, it works great because they usually give the correct answer first and sometimes a very creative answer that reflects a very unique perspective. This technique is a great way to turn their brains back on and recognize them for being smart or intuitive.
