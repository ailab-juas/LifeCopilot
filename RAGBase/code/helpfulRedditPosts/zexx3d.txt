title:
YSK that many 'influencers' intentionally make controversial content to spread their brand and boost their signal, and the most effective method of getting these kind of people to go away is to completely and totally ignore them

Why YSK:

Because we all unintentionally amplify and spread these toxic ideas and shit-takes when we share this kind of content that is nothing more than pure pabulum and basically amounts rage-bait - content with absolutely no true value whatsoever. I commented on a thread the other day because one of these insufferable skidmarks was on the front-page of /r/ImTheMainCharacter, albeit in a way that was meant to make fun of them - but the outcome was the exact same - his content was spread to hundreds of thousands and potentially millions of eyes, and if even 0.1% come away from that inspired to consume more of that kind of content, well - we're all worse off for it. 

Also important to keep in mind the power of youth in driving these trends - a lot of these morons are propelled forward by a horde of literal teenagers, children and adolescents - if your life's work is making content for mostly children and teenagers and none of it is actually enriching or educational your value to society is a negative, you suck hard and we would all be better off existing if you simply didn't.

So what do you do when somebody you know brings up one of these total losers in real life?

You laugh in their face and give them a look of extreme pity, like you genuinely feel sorry for them, because you really should. 

Any energy or engagement beyond that is wasted.
