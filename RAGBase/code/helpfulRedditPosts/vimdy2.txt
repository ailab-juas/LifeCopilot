title:
LPT: Amazon returns should be made at Kohl's Department Store whenever possible, if you have Amazon Prime

content:
Returning at Kohl's is free, if you have Amazon Prime. (This applies to UPS too, on many occasions.) However, at Kohl's you'll receive a $5 Kohl's cash coupon with your return receipt. 

As you head out the door, pick up a Godiva chocolate bar and a Kohl's water bottle for $4.76 (including tax) or use that coupon to take $5.00 off of whatever other purchase you'd like to make.

Edit: You don't actually get "Kohl's cash". What you get is a $5 coupon/certificate, which you can USE Immediately, even before you leave the store that day.
