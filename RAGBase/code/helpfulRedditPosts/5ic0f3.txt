LPT: Invest in RUBBER floor mats for your car. You can place them under your wheels to gain traction when stuck in snow or mud.

I've used this trick before. It works wonderfully, far better than trying to dig your car out for hours.   


Edit: YES, snow tires are obviously far better. Floor mats are simply a convenient method in an emergency where you don't have better alternatives. The key is to be prepared; rubber floor mats are simply something you'll never have to worry about forgetting to pack, but should not replace better methods.   

Carpeted mats will not work; the fibers will only get wet and more slippery.   

Rubber mats work because they are rough and have large grooves designed to keep them and your feet in place. Putting them between your tire and snow gives your tire added traction; your tire is now moving on something with friction instead of slick snow or mud. If your rubber mat flies out from under your tire, you're moving too fast.
