YSK that, although cute, giving your dog a whole egg to hold in it's mouth could be a choking hazard. Please use caution

content:
Just be aware that if your dog gulps it.. the egg can become lodged in the back of his/her mouth and because of it's shape you cannot grab it.  I hate to be that person, but be aware of the risks please.

EDIT.. some people think this should be common sense.. but until recently we didn't need to tell people not to eat laundry detergent either.

TRUE - most dogs won't choke on eggs, or die.. but if you tried this and your dog did die you would think "SHIT.. I wish I knew he could have died".. and yes some dogs do die choking on food or toys...
