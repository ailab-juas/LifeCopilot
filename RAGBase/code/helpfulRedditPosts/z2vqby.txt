title:
LPT: If frying your turkey, TURN OFF the fire prior to dipping.

content:
Once you’ve brought the oil to heat, RIGHT before you put in the turkey, turn OFF the gas/fire. So even if you do get spills or splashing, nothing will ignite and you’ll have time to clean up and wipe down before turning the fire back on. 

Extra: 

- Keep at least 20ft away from all structures (lawn/trees included). 

- To know the fill line, first fill it with water, then put in turkey, remove, and mark the fill line, then remove the water, DRY the bird, and you know how high to add the oil.

But if you want a better LPT: SMOKE the turkey instead, way better.
