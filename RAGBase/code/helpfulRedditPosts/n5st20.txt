title:
YSK everyone can hear the calls you take/make through your car's speakers

content:
why ysk: cars are not soundproof, the speakers in them are usually set to be very bass-y, everyone outside of the car can *feel* the rings when you are making a call. 

if you don't want everyone around your car to hear you, you might want to reconsider using the car speakers to take your calls
