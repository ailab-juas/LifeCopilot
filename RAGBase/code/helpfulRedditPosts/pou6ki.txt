YSK that if you ever find an animal stuck in a glue trap, oil can be used to free them

content:
Why YSK: Sometimes people set glue traps without realizing that anything can get stuck in them, and that it is a slow and agonizing death for the animal. But if you ever do find an animal stuck in one, vegetable oil or any other oil found in your kitchen can be used to loosen the glue and free the animal. 

When I was younger and didn't know any better, I set out some glue traps for roaches but ended up catching a mouse who was wiggling and squeaking like crazy. I put the whole thing in a jar, poured some canola oil over the trap, and released the mouse outside. He was wet and greasy, but happy to be free.
