LPT Booking an AirBNB in the US? Use a VPN to book from UK, EU or Aus

content:
In the UK, EU, and Aus it's illegal to tack on a load of bullshit fees and they have to show you the amount upfront with no surprises. Chances are you'll pay a hell of a lot less doing this.

Bonus: this also used to work with booking hotels and flights on sites like [Booking.com](https://booking.com/) and Expedia. You'll probably pay half of what you normally do just booking normally.
