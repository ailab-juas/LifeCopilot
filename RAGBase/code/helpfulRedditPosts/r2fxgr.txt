YSK that unless you were going to buy it anyway, a reduced price is not a "deal". You're spending more money than you otherwise would.

Why YSK:

Black Friday is here with retailers offering "discounts" but this applies no matter what the time of the year.

If you want to buy something, put it on a list and keep track of the price (tools like CamelCamelCamel (Amazon only), and TopPreise (Switzerland) can help here). If there's a "deal", first check it's actually money off and not artificially inflated and then buy it.

If you see something and go "wow! look at that reduction, I would lose money not buying it", you are taking money from your own pockets and giving it to retailers for something you don't really need.
