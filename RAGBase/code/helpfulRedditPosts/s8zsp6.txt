YSK: The old phrase “10 and 2”, referring to appropriate approximate locations of your hands on the steering wheel is no longer accurate. 9 and 3 is considered the safer standard today.

content:
Why YSK: “10 and 2” was the common idiom for driving instruction primarily because it allowed comfortable, safe, dual-handed grip on the wheel AND aided in turning steering wheels in vehicles WITHOUT power steering. Since the invention and adoption of steering wheel airbags AND the widespread use of power steering technology, 9 and 3 are considered better hand locations (with your thumbs placed on the face of the wheel instead of wrapped around it on the inside), as this will reduce the risk of your airbags launching your hands into your face and/or breaking your thumbs back.
