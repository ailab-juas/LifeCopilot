LPT: To get better at learning names...1. When you meet someone, repeat their name out loud to them for confirmation that you heard it right. 2. Repeat their name 3 times in your head in weird pronunciations 3. Use their name within 10-15 minutes through conversation. Try it!

content:
Remembering names shows the person that you are working to remember them and develop a connection. Plus it's so much easier to approach a person when you see them days/weeks later if you have their name in mind!

Example:
3rd party introducing you: Hey Christina, this is Rob!

Rob: Hi Christina, nice to meet you.

Christina: Hi Rob, nice to meet you too
.
Rob (silently in head): Christina, Chrissssstina, CH rist ina

(Next opening to talk) Rob: So Christina you work with (3rd party) in the same department?

Rob says the name in three different uses, one to greet, one in conversation, then repeats in head. This helps convert the name to memory.

I saw the earlier post about saying you are bad at names, which is fine (I used to do it myself!), but it doesn't actually help solve the root problem: learning names.
I adopted these tips a few years ago and now use them every time I meet someone, hopefully they help you too!

Note: Make sure when using #2 its in your head only, it may lead to some odd looks otherwise.
