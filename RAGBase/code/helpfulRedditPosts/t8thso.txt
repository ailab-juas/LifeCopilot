LPT: If you’re too broke to buy new clothes and dress well, wear same thing everyday and pretend like you’re a minimalist

content:
I wish I’ve known this tip when I was a self concious and poor teenager.

You can get plain t-shirt from H&amp;amp;M for like $5 so get like 5-7 of them and rotate em with different pants/skirt/jeans. 

If someone asks why you wear the same thing everyday, you can act like you’re woke and practicing minimalism for many different reasons like environment, rejecting consumerism, simplifying life, etc.

EDIT: 
Many of you guys mention thriftshop but based on my experience they’re not as cheap as yall think, ugly(if you’re young and care about the fit), and has wears and tears. As a hobby I visit thrift stores when I travel and I’ve driven to like 30 different states this year. They’re usually more expensive than buying a plain t-shirt at fast fasion.
