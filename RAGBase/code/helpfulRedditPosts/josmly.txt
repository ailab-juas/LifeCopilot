You'd honestly be incredibly suprised how easy it is to make things like pizza, chicken alfredo, teriyaki chicken, etc, at home from scratch. You can make a pizza in about the same time it'd take for one to be delivered, for a tenth of the price. You don't even have to let the dough rise, there's tons of no rise pizza dough recipes on the internet that still make amazing pies. Same thing goes for coconut shrimp. Buy some precooked deveined shrimp and you can have a plate in ten minutes. You can make chicken alfredo with literally just flour, butter, milk, chicken, and Parmesan cheese.

Why YSK how to cook: It can save you alot of money and be a really fun thing to do with family and friends.
