LPT: DON'T adopt an animal during this craziness because you're lonely, alternatively: reach out to your local animal shelter and see if they need help being a temporary foster. A failed foster (pet is adopted) is better than a failed adoption

I know Kansas City is offering a program to be a foster parent for 4-6 weeks so that they can close their shelters and I bet most other shelters are offering something as well. Also a good idea for parents whose kids want a pet but donâ€™t realize the amount of work one takes.
