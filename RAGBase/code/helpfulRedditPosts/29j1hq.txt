LPT: If you have a ton of fruit flies in your house, turn off all but one light source and wait 2 minutes. They will congregate there. Then, flick on a lighter and turn off the light source. The flies will burn their wings off trying to get close to the light source.

I had a horrible fruit fly problem yesterday because I found that the fruit fly traps were simply attracting MORE fruit flies. The lighter method cut their number by 50 within five minutes of cycling the light source and the lighter.
