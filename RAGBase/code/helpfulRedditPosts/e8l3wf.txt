LPT: Buy cologne/perfume while travelling and wear it every day on the trip. Your brain will associate the trip with that fragrance and every time you wear it afterwards, you will remember the memories made while travelling from the smell.

Instead of buying a shirt, mug, or a vile of sand, make some cologne/perfume your travelling token and bring home some memories in a bottle. I still have some French cologne in my room that brings me right back to Europe, 2015!
