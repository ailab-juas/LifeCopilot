YSK that strangulation can have serious delayed effects and you should always seek medical assistance after being strangled.

content:
I've just found this out this evening after being strangled myself. I couldn't see any bruising and felt no immediate symptoms, and was going to go to bed, until a friend suggested that I ring the non emergency number to seek advice.

I was advised by a doctor that strangulation (even if there are no visible or physical symptoms) can have serious delayed effects up to days or weeks after the event. These effects are serious and can include a stroke, heart attack or even death. 

Always always ***always*** seek medical assistance to check you over even if you feel fine. Cutting off oxygen for any amount of time causes brain damage, and the delayed effects could be life threatening.
