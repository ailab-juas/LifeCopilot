YSK Android N Nougat can show first responders vital medical information without going past your lock screen.

content:
As long as Android users fill out these medical profiles beforehand, first responders can find information about them immediately. The emergency info will prove especially useful in cases where the patient is alone and unconscious or unable to speak for other reasons.   

**To Add emergency information:**    
Go to Settings &gt; Users then select Emergency Information. Here you can add contact details, medical conditions and any medication you're currently taking.
