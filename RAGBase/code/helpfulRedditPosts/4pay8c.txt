title:
LPT: Make a distinct bend in your business card before dropping it in a bowl used for a drawing. The drawer is more likely to pick a card that sticks out rather than lays flat.

My father showed me this trick by actually winning at a work function raffle. He said it works about 1 out of 10 times, which is still better than the odds when there is 50-100 cards in the bowl. Someone actually came up to him after the drawling and said, "you must be lucky, you always get selected." My father shot me a wink.
