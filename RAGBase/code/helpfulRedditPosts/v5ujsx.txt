LPT: The benefits of meditation do not occur during the act of meditation but when you are NOT meditating. Sometimes minutes, hours, or even days later.

content:
This may be obvious and/or considered common knowledge to many but when I finally understood this sentiment it completely changed the way I thought about meditation. 

I used to think that I was supposed to have this moment of great enlightenment during the actual act of meditation and it caused me to dismiss meditation all together as it seemed to be only a gimic. 

I realized that the moments of enlightenment and increased happiness happens at random while you are going throughout your day. NOT when you are meditating. 

I feel the need to mention this for all of the people who gave meditation a chance only to become frustrated when "nothing happened" when you were meditating and you didn't see any benefits.

Give it another shot.
