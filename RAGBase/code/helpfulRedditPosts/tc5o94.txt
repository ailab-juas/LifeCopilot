LPT: If you want to make Indian vegetarian food, search for the word "Sabji" on YouTube/Google instead of 'Curry".

content:
No one in India uses the word Curry. Sabji means Vegetables. Most likely the video will be in Hindi or other Indian language but it's still not that difficult to understand, and the recipe would be described in the description. On that note get these 3-4 spices that's mostly used in Indian Sabjis, 1) Turmeric, 2) red chilli powder, 3) Coriander/Cilantro powder 4) Cumin powder.

Edit: Obligatory, holy shit! this blew up. 

Just to clarify, this LPT is for Vegetarian food only. The main reason for this LPT is to remove certain misconceptions 1) vegetarian food is not boring and 2) Cooking Indian food is not difficult. What you usually see when you search curry are recipes that most Indian households cook only for special occasions/weekends or eat in restaurants. Sabjis/Sabzis are what most Indian households cook most days and is much quicker and easy to make. You also can eat most of these sabjis/Sabzis with rice.

Edit 2: As many have said, cumin and mustard (black), ginger/garlic paste is also used in most dishes. Anyways, the point is the are endless options for good tasting vegetarian food, and it's not difficult to cook and requires only few inexpensive ingredients.
