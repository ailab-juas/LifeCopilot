LPT: Always be the person who tells someone they have something in their teeth, shoes untied, fly is down, etc

content:
I have done this my entire life and people are almost always extremely grateful. It can be a bit awkward but if someone walks into a meeting or starts a conversation with me and I notice something like that, I will immediately interrupt them to let them know.

**Edit:** Lets just pretend I said 'booger in the nose' instead of 'Shoe is untied.' Apparently there are a lot of people who have frequently untied shoes that are very sensitive. I'm a 'tie it once and stuff your foot in it every morning' kind of guy.
