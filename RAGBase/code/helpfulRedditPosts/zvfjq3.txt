title:
YSK to let faucets drip slowly, open cabinets with sinks above, and disconnect any hoses outside

content:
Why YSK: during cold seasons like this, having any faucets slowly dripping water will keep them from freezing/bursting. Opening the cabinets allows warm air to get in, and keep the pipes warm. Any hoses outside can have water in them, and cause the pipes to get clogged, and burst. Stay warm and safe; sorry for being a few days late!
