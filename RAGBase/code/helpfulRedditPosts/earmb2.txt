LPT: if your high school GPA and extracurriculars aren't up to par for the university you're interested in, attend community college for two years and save some money whilst boosting up your stats.

Community colleges are also know for smaller class sizes and a more friendly feel which is great when you're just beginning to "adult". You can also use this time to figure out what you want to major in without being out a lot of money.
