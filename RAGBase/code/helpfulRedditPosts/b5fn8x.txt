LPT: It’s FREE to go to the humane society and pet kitties—this can help someone who is unable to have pets and/or people who are chronically lonely.

content:
I do this often! All I do is walk in and ask the receptionist if I can come inside and pet the kitties. They *always* say yes! 

I usually sit in the kitty room for an hour playing, petting, interacting, and bonding with them. The kitties love it because they need attention and I love it because I can tell how much they’re loving it. 

For me, going there sets me happy for the rest of the day!

Sometimes you get to see them being picked to be adopted too, which always warms my heart. (:
