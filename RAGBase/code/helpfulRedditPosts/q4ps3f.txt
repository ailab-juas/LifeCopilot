LPT: Don't be afraid to ask for the salary you want/deserve.

content:
I just finished the loooooong process of being interviewed for a new position at a new place of work. In the final meeting with the hiring manager, I was told the range they were looking at for the offer, and the upper-end was what I was making at my previous job (which I would be leaving to take the new role).

I decided to be transparent and tell the hiring manager that. I then said I would feel more comfortable with 7k more. Inside I was SO nervous that they'd pull the rug from under my feet, say I was being greedy (in more professional terms), and wave goodbye. Instead, they said it would be a stretch, but they'd see what they could do.

Came back the next day with the offer I was hoping for! To top it off, they said they appreciated my transparency which is why they went to bat for me.

Never be afraid to ask if you feel it's fair and you're deserving.
