LPT: Always take pictures of your rental vehicle during pickup and drop off.

content:
Take multiple pictures from all sides for proof that you returned it in exact condition you rented and keep them at least for a few weeks. Make sure the windshield is chipfree before renting it. Some unscrupulous companies tend to charge customers for preexisting scratches and dings.

Edit: As per a rental car tech who posted below, they go over 200 cars a day. So including human error on part of rental car agencies.

Edit2: tips from other posters. 1. Take pictures of the interior, roof, underside, odometer and gas (fuel) gauge of rental vehicles.
2. Take before and after pictures of apartments, hotel rooms, Airbnbs, etc.
