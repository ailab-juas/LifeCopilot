LPT: When you come back from a holiday, dont go straight back to work. Plan a few extra days off for when you can return, unpack, relax and still be in holiday mode. This way, going back to work won't be as daunting.

Edit: Wow..people you need the calm the farm down. For the few smarties out there..that caught on that I am not American..here is a slow clap for you. Now for the rest of you, let me reprase what I mean. What you Americans call vacation days..is what the rest of the world call holidays. That is what I mean. You dont need to travel all across the Antartic to enjoy this LPT. I merely mean, if you were to take a 3 or 4 day vacation, to even say go visit your grandma that lives in another time zone. Come home with another day or two off to spare..or close to a weekend (if your sadistic employers give you a weekend off) That way, you get to recoup, rewind, look at pictures, unpack..do whatever the heck your heart desires. Before you go back to the hell hole you call life.
