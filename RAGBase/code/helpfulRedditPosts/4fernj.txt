title:
LPT: When calling a company to complain, ask where to be directed 1st rather than explaining your situation right away with no pauses.

content:
Often the first person to answer is a receptionist/secretary whose job is to screen/transfer your call to the correct department, not handle each situation. You'll save yourself and the person on the other line some time and stress of repeating yourself by asking first rather than explaining only to hear "I'm sorry to hear that but let me transfer you to client services."

**thank you for the gold kind stranger. I understand this is common sense for the most part, and also applies to not just complaints.**
