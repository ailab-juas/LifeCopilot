title:
LPT: do not gift a pet as a surprise. It is a long term time and financial commitment that requires serious consideration by the recipient.

content:
Instead, consider gifting something like a collar or a leash, then going to select the pet together later on.  It's much easier returning a collar than an animal.

Even if it's for someone in your household and you are willing to take care of it. If it's meant for someone other than yourself, they should be part of the selection process.  The bond needs to be there, and it's risky making that judgement call on your own.

Edit: I'm not suggesting you let your 3 month old baby pick out a dog.  There are exceptions.  Gotta love reddit.
