LPT: Keep making that car payment after it's paid off.

You're used to paying it and it's generally budgeted into your monthly bills. Keep making that payment into your savings because you are sooner or later going to need a new car. By doing this you can have a decent down payment.



Edit: woah, didn't think this would blow up like this. Just wanted to share a shower thought. Great comments. Thanks for the awards or whatever you call them ðŸ˜Š
