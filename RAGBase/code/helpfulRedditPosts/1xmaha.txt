title:
YSK that if you are shoveling a running vehicle out of the snow, make sure you clear the tailpipe FIRST.

content:
A car can continue to run with a blocked tailpipe filling the vehicle with CO, which can be fatal in high concentrations. 
  
Multiple CO poisoning incidents occurred last year during heavy snow as loved ones waited in the warm car.

Clear your tailpipe!

edit: some confusion around whether the tailpipe is actually truly blocked or exhaust gases surrounding the car. according to the CDC source below: 
&gt;The cause of the CO poisonings was directly related to exposure to automobile exhaust from vehicle exhaust systems blocked with snow.

I'd suggest clearing both obstructions in or around the tailpipe as well as underneath the vehicle to be certain.
