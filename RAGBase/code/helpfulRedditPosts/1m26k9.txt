LPT: Race the microwave to keep a clean kitchen.

content:
This is mostly for those chore-phobic, who put off doing the dishes as long as possible, or wiping down the counters.

When you put your hot pocket in the microwave, see how much you can get clean in two minutes. Clean the dishes, empty the dishwasher, wipe down the counter, toss out your beer bottles, whatever. When the microwave goes off, go back to what you were doing. You'll be surprised how much you can get done in two minutes.

This is something I started doing in my first apartment, and it really helped put into perspective how little time and effort is required, even for seemingly huge messes.

Of course, the key is maintenance, but this is a good way to start forming the habit.
