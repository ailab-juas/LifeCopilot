YSK that Discount Tires, Les Schwab, and several other tire chains offer free air checks and flat repairs.

Why YSK:

Found this out unintentionally the other day. Ran over a nail somewhere the day before and had to take it in. Already had a bunch of money tied up this month, so I was dreading the cost. To my surprise, Discount got me in and fixed it for free in half an hour. Found out this was a pretty common thing among these chains.

I'm sure this'll be of value to someone in a similar pickle with money on their mind, or simply if you've been putting off pumping up your tires.
