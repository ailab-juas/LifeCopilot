LPT: When you compliment somebody on their artwork, say something nice about the technique instead of the subject matter.

So, for example, if someone has drawn a picture of a robot, say something like "I really like the way you've shaded the darker areas" instead of "I think it's cannons/legs/wings are cool."

While the second statement certainly has value, the first shows that you appreciate the person's artistic skill and not just their design.
