title:
YSK that you can watch the first episode of Planet Earth II for free on Amazon

content:
It says for a limited time only and you probably need an account, but it's a cool episode. I'd recommend checking it out if you liked the first season and aren't sure how the second one is going to be.

Spoiler alert: it's awesome.
