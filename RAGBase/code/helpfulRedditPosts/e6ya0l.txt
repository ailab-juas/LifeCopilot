LPT: Perform small daily tasks with your non dominant hand to become ambidextrous

content:
 If  you have a job or hobby that requires you to be ambidextrous (like  playing an instrument) or just want to impress people with your skills,  you can try performing small daily tasks like brushing your teeth,  opening doors, eating or even using the mouse with your non dominant  hand. It will be hard at first but you will be amazed at the  possibilities being ambidextrous will present to you.
