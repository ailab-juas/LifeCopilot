title:
YSK that hand sanitizer can temporarily remove body odour

content:
*note- do not use this instead of a shower or if you know your skin is sensitive to sanitizer*

B.O= a combination of sweat and *bacteria* 

Sometimes we forget to put on deodorant and get a bad case of BO while we’re out an about. It doesn’t help that there is no access to a shower or private sink/basin to quickly give them a wash. Deodorant on top also doesn’t mask the smell. 

This is where sanitizer comes in handy as it kills the bacteria that causes the smell and can temporarily stop you from smelling until you sweat again (unless you put deodorant on after sanitising.) some sanitizers have a scent which can make you smell fresh. 

why YSK in case you ever find yourself in a moment with stinky armpits and need to get rid of it.
