title:
LPT: Close your shower curtain after your shower to prevent mold from growing.

content:
When bunched the curtain holds water in for much longer and gives time for mold to grow.  If the curtain is closed water can evaporate easily.

edit: Warning for tile showers, doing this may cause mold to grow in your tile cracks. For the over-assumptious folks assuring this is a silly thing every human already knows, my inbox is littered with people who had no clue and thanked me for the tip. Making people feel like neanderthals isn't the best approach to effective communication. For all the haters: This may not prevent mold from growing and may not be a "pro" tip, but it has the potential to prolong the use of a shower liner, and the subreddit provided a wonderful platform to spread a this little tip to make people's lives a bit easier. Take it one step further by opening your window/door to drop the humidity, and leave openings at the ends of the curtain to allow air flow. To grammar sensitive people, I apologize for the awkward structure of the title. To those offering suggestions like: anti-bacterial liners, disinfectant sprays, vinegar treatments, etc, I thank you. These methods will do wonders to prevent shower mold growth.
