LPT: If you make a big mistake or are in the wrong, own up to your mistake as soon as possible and apologize if needed. You will get a lot further in life.

My boss always says that if you make a mistake at work (or home or school) and own up to it, it’s hard for people to stay mad at you if you admit you’re wrong and try to do better next time. If you try to blame someone/something else for your f*ck up, people will lose respect for you because you can’t take responsibility for your actions. It’s easier to just tell the truth and move on. This has always stuck with me and I find it works in almost all situations.

EDIT: I’m sad to see some of you took this route and were fired from a job. Some mistakes are unfortunately just too big to let slide and some managers/leadership are just sh*t. All we can do sometimes is learn from our mistakes and grow as humans. I wish you all the best in your job hunt!
