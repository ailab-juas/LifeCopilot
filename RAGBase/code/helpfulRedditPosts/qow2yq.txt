LPT: Treat private, personal information like your money. You shouldn't need to explain why you don't want to give it, they should need to give a good explanation for why they want it from you. It's okay to say, "That's not a good enough reason for me to share."

Some people are just being friendly, and there's usually give and take to a good conversation when getting to know a co-worker or neighbor.

Someone might offer you something you don't want in return for your information. Don't feel obligated to 'pay' them for it. Someone approaching you and asking for your address or relationship status may tell you their own as a way to make you feel obligated to reciprocate. A gossip may tell you everyone else's business because the want to know yours. A competitive peer might want to know your accomplishments so they can compare themselves to you. Bullies want to make you uncomfortable and may ask personal questions in a group setting to pressure you to open up, or they'll word their questions in a way that there's a clear implied right or wrong answer.

Instead of responding to these requests with either an answer, or a statement like, "I'm not comfortable sharing," or "that's none of your business," try, "Why is that information important to you right now?" or just, "Why do you ask?" It turns the interrogation around from you having to give them excuses to them needing to justify the question. Whatever excuse they give, or whatever way they try to attack your reserve, "That's not a good enough reason," is a perfectly appropriate way to end the discussion.
