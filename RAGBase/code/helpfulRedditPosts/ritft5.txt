LPT: "The axe forgets; the tree remembers". You may forget or don't even care that you hurt someone in some way, but they'll always remember. It will define who you are to them. Be aware.

~~Also, it's never too late to apologize.~~ Sometimes it is, now that I think about it.. or not. It depends.

Obviously, I didn't make this quote; it is an African proverb that seeks to explain that people will remember what you did to them. If you shout at someone, you might forget it the next day, but that person will forever remember you shouted at them.

It does go both ways too. Let's say you told someone their new shirt was cool, you might forget you said that, but they'll definitely remember it. They'll remember you in a good way.
