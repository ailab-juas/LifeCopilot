YSK that cheap clothes from stores like H&amp;M, AE, and Forever 21 will actually last you years if you hang them instead of machine drying

content:
A lot of people complain about the quality of $5-15 shirts and other articles of clothing from more budget end retailers but if you actually take care of how you wash them they will not fall apart as quick, if at all. Just a PSA to let you know you don't necessarily need to buy high end to get long lasting. Just wash your budget clothes as if they were high end.

Edit: AE clothes are not cheap, just equally low budget material (in many cases)

Edit 2: As noted by others, choose your local thrift whenever possible! And if you already have clothes from these retailers, take care of them and expand their lifespans to reduce your need for new clothing!
