LPT: Find out how long it takes to get a sunburn with Wolfram Alpha

content:
I recently discovered Wolfram Alpha had the capability to calculate the time it takes to get a sunburn, it factors in weather, skin type, time, UV index, required SPF and more. 

You can send a query via a search containing the word 'sunburn', you can also include locations, dates, and times. 

For example,
http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sunburn+in+cuba+on+july+10th+at+1PM would return the time it takes to sunburn in cuba on july 10 at 1PM.
