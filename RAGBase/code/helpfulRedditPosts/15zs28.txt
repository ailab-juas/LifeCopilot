LPT: If a motorcyclist pats his or her head with an open palm, it means "cop/danger ahead" just as if a car were to flash its lights.

content:
I give this signal to my fellow road-goers when I'm on my bike and I thought more people should know, as its not very common or known to those that don't ride.

I use an open palm on the very top of my head. Other riders I have seen do it on the side of the head, or using the tip of their bent pointer finger.

We CAN flash our lights, but often times it goes unnoticed. I personally use signals because flashing your brights at people is illegal in the state that I live and I have an irrational fear of flashing my lights at another cop. Tapping the top of your head, of course, is not illegal as far as I know.
