LPT: Picking up trash is a life changing hobby.

content:
This is easy and very rewarding.  Nature is everywhere, yet unfortunately humans tend to clutter it with garbage, damaging the ecosystem to the detriment of all of us.  It's a big problem, but we can all help.

Find a local area, beach, river, forest area, whatever, go there, and pick up some trash.  Simply put a plastic grocery bag in your pocket before heading out and spend a nice couple hours in nature making it a healthier, happier place.

Benefits:
Spend time in nature, helping to conserve, preserve, and restore.  (Don't forget to check out all the little life forms you are benefiting by helping to clean up their home)

Get a bit of exercise.

Make the world a cleaner, better place.

Who knows, maybe somebody will see you cleaning up and it will spark a train of thought that eventually leads to them helping to clean up too someday.

Instead of waiting for other people to change, to stop littering, we can make a difference today.  And it feels great doing it.
