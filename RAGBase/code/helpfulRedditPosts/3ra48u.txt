LPT: When breaking up with someone, make a list of the reasons that made you break up with that person. If you're thinking of getting back together, read that list.

content:
We tend to idealize our partners after a while. We forget their defects and the reasons that made us get away in the first place. This list is really helpful in those moments when we feel lonely and tempted to call again. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold!
