LPT- NEVER sit in a stained chair in the Poker room of a Casino.

content:
That stain is NOT from a spilled drink. It's human waste (Urine and Feces). Gambling addiction is a serious issue that doesn't garner as much attention as it should. Many addicts wear adult diapers or pull ups so they can continue to play without needing to get up to go to the bathroom. Their addictions are so severe that they are willing to put themselves through what most of us would consider one of our worst nightmares. The workers at the Casino are not even allowed to confront someone defecating right in front of them (at least not where I worked).

Sometimes, If you take a good look at the stain, it becomes obvious that it is human waste. There will be two butt cheek marks on the chair with the waste forming around where the person was sitting. There will also be a stain right up the middle of the butt cheeks.

This is an issue in the poker room because they use regular non leather office chairs in these areas. Typically, slot machine chairs are protected with a material that repels liquids. This is because the chairs are attached to the machines and can't be removed. I worked for a few months as a custodian at a Casino and one of my daily tasks was pulling 5-10 stained chairs from the Poker floor  and using a carpet extractor with a handheld extracting attachment to remove the waste from the chairs. We then dried them out over night and returned them the next day to replace newly stained chairs. The Casino I worked at is a lower populated area. If it happened at my Casino, it happens at yours...

Update: apparently not an issue at all casinos. Maybe just lower income areas? I am sure other casino workers will continue to comment and add info. Great discussion!
