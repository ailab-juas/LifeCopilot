LPT: The three steps to an effective apology

content:
1. Say you’re sorry and what you did

2. Say why it was wrong

3. Say what you’re going to do different in the future

This is perhaps the best skill my mother ever taught me, and has helped me in literally every stage of my life. For example, I’m sorry that I yelled at you. You’re one of my closest friends and you don’t deserve to be treated that way. I won’t speak to you that way again. 

It’s that simple. I’ve found that this type of apology is so strong that it doesn’t just patch up the issue. If I have an argument with a friend and then give an apology like this, 9 times out of ten we’re closer than we were before the argument. One time when I really misbehaved in elementary school my mom made me write these steps 100 times on a piece of paper and then march into school the next morning and apologize to the teacher lol.
