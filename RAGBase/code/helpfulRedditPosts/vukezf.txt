LPT: Always politely ask for a discount rate when you book a hotel room

content:
I do a lot of last minute travelling as part of a side gig.  Every time I get a hotel room, I am friendly and pleasant, and always ask if there is *any* kind of discount they can offer me.  Sometimes there isn't anything they can do, which is fine.  But almost always, I wind up with a discount or upgrade of some kind.  Today I got $100 off!

The most important part is being unfailingly polite to the person on the phone or behind the counter.  It isn't entirely in their control to give you a discount, but I have always found that if I am nice, they go to the very limits of what they are allowed to discount, or they upgrade me in lieu of a discount.
