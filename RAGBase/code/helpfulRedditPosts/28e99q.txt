LPT: If you want to watch the World Cup but only have basic cable (no ESPN / Fox Sports) your local spanish station is probably covering the whole thing

content:
I'm too broke to afford espn / other channels that are presenting the World Cup 2014. ABC only shows a few select games [in my area].

I found that my local spanish station is showing all the games. I don't understand a thing but I get to brush up on my spanish and haven't missed a single game so far.

EDIT: This LPT is aimed at people living in the U.S. where football is not as popular as it is in other countries.
