LPT: Despite what you've heard, honey is not healthier than sugar and is actually higher calories than sugar. The "antibacterial", "antifungal" properties comes from its high sugar and low water content, and loses those "anti" properties once added to water or any other medium.

Edit: It seems that people are confusing this LPT for advocating sugar use over honey,  when sugar is just as bad for your health.     

This was meant to show that people can't  consume honey as a healthy alternative to sugar, when they are both detrimental to your health.  All the benefits of raw honey are non evident within the pasteurized honey most people get.    

Additionally,  a study has found that honey, High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), and sugar act the same way to your health in the long run: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/11/honey-seemed-like-a-healthier-choice-then-scientists-tested-it-against-high-fructose-corn-syrup/     

Lastly,  unless you're getting your honey from the farm, what you get from the store may be honey that has HFCS mixed in, which is a common scam honey suppliers run:

Not only have they turned to such practices,  but most industrialized bee farms will also feed bees HFCS versus flower nectar to save costs, so what you're getting isn't honey made from flowers, but literally processed HFCS from bees:
