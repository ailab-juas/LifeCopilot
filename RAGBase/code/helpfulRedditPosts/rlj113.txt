LPT: Marry someone who is okay with not going into massive debt to fund your wedding.

content:
Nothing builds resentment quite like starting your life together in massive debt that was completely unnecessary.

Edit: Iâ€™m happily married. Our wedding cost about $5000 and was completely paid off a year before we got married. I posted this as I have multiple friends who are divorced and the number one reason is because of financial resentment stemming from entering into marriage with debt that added unnecessary stress when before marriage they were debt free.

Edit: thanks for the awards much appreciated
