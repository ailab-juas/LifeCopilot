YSK that most car insurance policies are also extended to rental cars.

content:
I recently went to Canada and rented a car.  Good thing I called my insurance company and they told me that my policy also has a complementary coverage for rental vehicles. This saved me over $240 dollars worth of insurance over a weekâ€™s rental.

Edit: This was also new for me and definitely saved me money, however, after reading the comments I learned a lot.  So the most important point for those who wish to try this in future is READ YOUR POLICY AND THE FINE PRINT.  Talk to your agent for clarification.  I have a really good coverage including collision and comprehensive and a very generous liability coverage, which according to my agent extends to a rental car., but this may not be true for all.  So test the water before you jump in.

Edit2: I see few comments about credit cards coverage for CDW.  I used that quite a lot but recently, many credit cards have silently dropped that benefit.  So check with your card to avoid an unpleasant surprise.  For example, Discover card used to have this benefit but not anymore.
