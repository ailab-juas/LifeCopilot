LPT If you don’t know a lot about a subject, it’s okay to say something like, “I don’t know enough to have an opinion on that.”

I do it all the time. You don’t have to get into a potential argument about something you’re not knowledgeable about and the subject can be changed pretty easily if the subject is uncomfortable.

Edited to add- Several posts have put a political spin on this. Infuriating, but not the purpose of this post.
