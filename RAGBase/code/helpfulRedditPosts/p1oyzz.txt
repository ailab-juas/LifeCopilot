title:
YSK: if you get something from amazon twice, just keep it. They don't want it back.

content:
If you order something, it gets delayed, but you already informed amazon that I got lost in the mail. Now they sent you the thing again, and you have it twice. At this point you should keep it.

Why YSK: If you give it back, it will likely go to a landfill. Even if it gets sold again, it will cost amazon so much, they don't even want it.

If you don't need it, give it to a friend or family member, or even sell it to someone close to you.

Note: I don't know if this applies to third party sellers
