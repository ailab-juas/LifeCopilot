YSK a few things about death and cremation: Ashes aren't like they are in the movies, urns are sometimes clear, and know what you're getting into before touching your loved one at a viewing

Why YSK:

1. It is entirely possible that the "default" option your funeral home will use for urns is **clear plastic jars**. It sounds hard to believe, but it's true, and it's not relegated to cheap places. Make sure you clear this up when arranging things for the deceased. I might even recommend looking up local funeral homes now, while you're not struggling under the weight of bereavement. 

2. **The ashes will not be dust** like it looks in the movies **unless** you specify to the crematorium that you want it ground fine. You do not want the surprise of coarse, multicolored bone chunks if you choose to spread them. You also don't want this combined with #1.

3. **Embalmed skin does not feel the same**. Holding my loved one's hand was a mistake. If you're trying to remember the feeling of their hands, face, etc, this will not do it, I'm sorry. During the embalming process, the skin becomes leathery and the flesh develops a strange layered feeling. This is strong and cannot be missed. If you must, I recommend brushing your hand along their hair (while not pressing down to the scalp!). Sometimes shocking oneself is necessary for grounding you in reality, but it's not good for everyone. 

4. The open casket: In my limited experience, bloating is more common than sunken features like you see in the movies. If you're afraid to see your loved one's face, don't trust the funeral director to tell you your loved one looks good (obviously you should trust a negative assessment)-- they've only seen them in two dimensional photos. Pick a resilient friend or family member you trust to go in first and tell you how they look.

Bonus: Start taking candid photos and videos of your loved ones now, especially if they're usually the one holding the camera. Frantically rifling through photo albums and realizing how little you have after your resident family photo taker has passed is a singular horror.
