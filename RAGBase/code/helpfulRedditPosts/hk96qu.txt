YSK it is OKAY to ban someone from your home, even if they are family. If they do not contribute positively to your life.

I constantly see this on the aita sub so I think it would be good to post it here. It is OK to kick anyone out of your home,  even if they are your mother,  father,  sibling,  cousin,  aunt,  uncle,  grandparent,  if they are toxic or hurting you. The excuse "but they are family" is bull and if "but family" was so important they would not be hurting you in the first place. You disserve to feel safe and loved,  especially in your own home. And respect is earned. Not just giving to someone because of age or relation. Please take care or yourself and set healthy boundaries.

Edit. Kids can be assholes to but it is 0% OK to kick out a kid that is under 18 for any reason. Take care of your children people!
