LPT: Don't stay in a toxic environment hoping you'll gain some sort of respect with people. To them, you are simply under their thumb and expendable.

content:
I worked in a start-up in late 2020 related to the degree I had gotten in college, biochemistry. My supervisor was an alumni at my college, so I thought we could get along, but it turned out she was a borderline sociopath who would throw adult temper tantrums when things weren't done exactly her way, even if higher ups told me to do something otherwise. I hoped to gain some sort of respect, in the hopes of getting a reference, but it ended in disaster with her verbally abusing me in front of co-workers, that I had "molested" the company, and told me to get out. Not allowing myself to be treated like shit so much, I lashed out on her and told her she was a patronizing psycho, which got me a disciplinary action from my university because she was an alumni, while I was merely a simple student they could toss under the boss. In the end, never sucker up to adult babies, you deserve respect as a grown-ass adult.

TLDR: Psycho alumni verbally abuses me because I don't set boundaries in hope of reference. Get sick of her and stand up for myself, got academic probation as a result and anger management.
