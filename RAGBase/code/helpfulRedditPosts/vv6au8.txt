LPT tips from a repo Man

content:
I do a lot of rpossessions in and around Atlanta. It's a job that can get dangerous but 99% of the time goes smoothly. I wanted to gives some information to help you out so you know what's what. Before we begin Anything you've seen on TV with all these towing shows that were out for a while is complete and utter BS. No bank would do business with a tow company that got violent with their customers or cussed out their customers. They want their customers to pay their bills and continue being customers and not end up on YouTube because of something stupid. 

1) We can get in 90% of the facilities, apartment complexes, and parking garages even if they are gated and sometims even if they have a live guard. The reason for this is when you signed the loan you signed the "Security Agreement" which states that I have the explicit right as an agent of your bank to go on any property that this vehicle is located on.Its like you have already said I can come over if it's there.

2) There are several ways we have of identifying your vehicle from GPS, tag, vehicle description, Vin. If I'm looking for your vehicle and I see one that fits the description I look for the tag, if it's a match and I know I've got my vehicle. If the description fits but the tag doesn't matc I still get out of my truck and examine closer. I walk up and check the VIN on the windshield. And here's where a lot of people mess up at, they will put a card or something to cover it up thinking that they have kept me from going any further. Did you know it's illegal to cover the vin on a car? Did you know that if a police looks at your vin and it's covered up he's going to unlock it or call a tow truck to come by and unlock it? If the vehicle is in the area I'm looking for it and matches the description and the Vin is covered up I'm going to unlock the car and look for the vin in one of the several different locations it's t. Even if I'm wrong and I unlocked the wrong car I can lock it and be gone before anybody else knows that I've done that but even if they see me and they call the police or something the police are just going to say that you had your VIN covered up. How was anyone supposed to know?

3) You don't have to run from the repo Man. Yes we are going to try to talk you out of your car but we can't physically take it from you. Even if the police were called they can't tell you to give me the car and they can't tell me to drop it. This is a civil matter. There's no point coming out threatening violence or cussing me out for just doing my job. I understand this is a highly emotional moment and I'm going to try to make it as easy for you as possible but the moment you start threatening me threatening my job threatening physical violence against me or my children all of that changes I stop being a nice guy I stop being cooperative. I had a lady asking me from her back porch if I would give her a second so she can get something out of her car and I said sure she came down hopped in it and did not get out refuse to get out I explained to her that she might be able to stop me this time but next time I will not give her a chance to get anything out of her car I'm going to grab it and go as fast as possible. That's exactly what I did at 5:30 in the morning two days later when I came back right before she was to go to work.

4) It's always best to give me the car if I hooked up to it. The banks do not want to keep your car. They want you to get it back and finish making payments so they can collect all that interest from you. One way they can make sure you remmber to make payments is by having the car reposses,they think it's like a kick in the ass or something to remind you of this. There is only one exception to this. If I come to take the car and you refuse to allow me to get it or you run out and close the garage door as I'm walking up or you run out and jump in the car and sit in it and tell me I can't take it the bank is not going to want to give you the car back. At this point you are now a risk to them. You signed a contract with them stating that if you didn't make payments they could come by and get the car and you not allowing it is a breach of your contract even further than not paying it. They frown on this really bad. And also wouldn't you rather me get the car at your home instead of when you're at Walmart with a grocery cart full of cold Frozen items in your children and you walk outside and see the car is gone?

5) You really shouldn't leave guns in your car overnight. When we repossessed these vehicles we take them to a parking lot with a locking gate. At night other than the repo drivers no one is on these lots. There have been instances where people have broken into the cars and done damage to them, once with a fire extinguisher they took off one of our trucks. The vehicles for a course repaired and taking care of but if there would have been guns in these cars and we didn't notice it they could very easily have been stolen. 

I got into this business due to covid killing my career and the industry not coming back yet and my car got repossessed and when I went to pick it up was offered a job. We don't pick this job to be mean or hateful, it's out of necessity sometimes. We've got wives and children at home and families that would miss us if something happened so remember your car isn't worth a prison sentence by committing violence against us. The funny thing about this is is how it's never the person that owns the vehicle that is trying to cause problems. It's always their friends they're on the porch or on the balcony or in the yard that are saying things to the effect of "hey man he ain't going to take that car if you don't want him to"

If you have any questions or want to know anything about the towing industry feel free to ask me.

**Update** people that get loans on their cars and then don't pay them know why I'm there to pick them up. I signed a contract with a bank to borrow money so they can get a vehicle, I've done it I'm pretty sure majority of the people reading this have done it and you know that if you don't pay your bill they will come and take your car. The car's not your car until you finish making payments on it and get the title. I'm not being a thief by doing this I'm completing the contract that you signed and knew you were signing. You can hate me threaten me wish me pain and every sort of way that you want that I get fired and all this that you want but your opinion doesn't matter to me. I was trying to let people know the ins and out of repossessions so they don't mess their cars up by slamming into a wall to run when they don't have to do that. There's videos online of people running from a repo Man running over multiple people. That wasn't necessary. If you're not going to let me get the car just tell me I can't get it. I've had my car repossessed I stated in this story I know how it feels but I also knew it was coming because I didn't pay my bill. if you don't want me doing my job then the banks won't do the loans that help these people buy the cars and then the cars don't get bought and then the people are walking yeah your method sounds great. You don't have to be hateful to not like what I say you don't have to be threatening. I was just trying to help people out

***Update 2*** I've had some pretty ball and messed up things that have been posted to this that a lot of them have been deleted right after they get posted not by me but you can insult me insult the industry and salt Banks or whatever you want but no one forced you to get the loan. You went to that bank you signed that paperwork and you drove away with that car. If you don't pay for something how do you expect to get to keep it? Used to be a man's word was his bond but I guess agreeing to make payments on something and then not continuing with those payments doesn't count somehow
