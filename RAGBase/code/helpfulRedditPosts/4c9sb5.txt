title:
LPT: don't recommend a friend for a job unless you've seen them work or you are willing to risk both relationships. A good friend isn't always a good worker.

content:
Someone who is a good friend doesn't necessarily  translate to someone who has a strong work ethic. 


Recommending them only for them to mess up reflects badly on you and could ruin the friendship and your relationship with the employer.
