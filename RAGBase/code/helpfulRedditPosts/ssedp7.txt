YSK That there are many of us drivers out there with driving habit apps.

Why YSK: Just because we are driving the speed limit, this doesn't mean we are old or slow or not also in a hurry.

I have the State Farm DriveSafe app and dongle. It helps me save a few bucks on car insurance (and driver safer, yadda yadda). I can only assume a lot more ppl do nowadays....

My commute to work is partly 1 mile next to a city park, with the speed limit being 30. TRUST me, I am not super thrilled about 30 either, but every day I'm force to think "bro I'm dongled in here, not purposely trying to piss you off, bear with!" 

So keep us mind. I was once one of you, and believe me, likely worse, so when you see a slow poke, they could be trying to save money on their car insurance.
