LPT: Don't put your wallet in your back pocket. It tilts the axis of your pelvis and over time can cause or exacerbate low back or hip issues.

edit: Didn't expect such a large response! To clarify, I was referring to **sitting** on your wallet for prolonged periods of time. This can press on the periformis/sciatic nerve and/or raise ("hike") one hip, causing the QL and other muscles to compensate. This may not affect everyone equally, but it is something to consider if you have sciatic or low back pain, especially on the side you sit on your wallet.

edit 2: Thanks u/BurntPaper for sharing [this source](http://iach.amedd.army.mil/sections/clinics/physicalTherapy/pdf/PIRIFORMIS%20SYNDROME.pdf) on periformis syndrome. Also, for those of you who are wanting to "undo" the effects, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl474z1bhnk) is a video of myofascial release and stretching for the affected area.

edit 3: Apologies to anyone who thought that I meant the weight of a wallet when walking would somehow throw you off over time. I got a good laugh out of that though, hope you did too.
