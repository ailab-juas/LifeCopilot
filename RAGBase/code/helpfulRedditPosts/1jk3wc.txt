LPT: Deodorant on an insect bite or other itchy site will stop the itch.

content:
While I definitely wouldn't recommend putting it on severe rashes or any open skin, running deodorant over an insect bite stops the itch almost immediately! I keep a stick of unscented deodorant specifically for this purpose. In some cases, I've found it works better than anti-itch creams - plus it's less messy.
