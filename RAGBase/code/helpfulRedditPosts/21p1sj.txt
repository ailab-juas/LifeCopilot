LPT: If you're the new person to a workplace, school, or other social engagement and you're afraid of how you'll be judged, don't think how they may judge your weaknesses, but instead focus on how your strengths may impress them.

The truth is, most people don't spend their time judging you. Your thoughts do not represent reality, but they can influence how you perceive it and how you treat it. Your thoughts affect your choices which affect your actions which affect your habits which affect your character. It's only important to be careful what you think about when it goes through this train of experience.

 This was the epitome of my high school and college life. I became socially awkward thanks in part to convincing myself that I was.
