YSK: Perfume is a common migraine trigger.

content:
Why YSK: A lot of people are sensitive to perfume and it can give people headaches, stomach problems and even migraines, so you should try to be considerate of that when deciding where, when and how much to wear. 

Don't wear it if you're going to be in an enclosed space in close proximity to others for more than a few minutes, and no matter where you are, don't overdo it. 

You don't need to spray it multiple times all over yourself. Just a small squirt onto your wrists, rub together, and rub on your neck. That is more than enough for anyone near you and yourself to enjoy it without leaving a big cloud of scent behind you everywhere you go.

ETA: YS(also)K that your perfume, cologne, etc isn't covering up the smell of smoke or other odours. It just makes it worse.

Second Edit: OK a few people have commented that you're not supposed to rub perfume because blah blah blah. *Dab* it then. Point remains the same... You only need one teeny tiny spritz.
