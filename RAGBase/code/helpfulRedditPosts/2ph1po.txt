LPT: Use Elmer's School Glue to reduce the volume on that annoying kids toy.

content:
If you have an excessively loud toy with no volume control, rub a thin smear of Elmer's glue over the speaker holes. Nothing I have done this to has ever been damaged, but use at your own risk. (Also don't if your kid might eat it.)
