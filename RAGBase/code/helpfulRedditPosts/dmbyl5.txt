YSK if a service dog approaches you without their human, follow them; their person is down and in need of help.

This actually happened to me in my home town, a dalmatian with his service dog "coat" escorted me to their owner who had a stroke. I called 911 (112 where I'm from) and the ambulance took him and the dog to the hospital. Don't just ignore the dog and assume it's a stray dog, it's trained to act accordingly.
