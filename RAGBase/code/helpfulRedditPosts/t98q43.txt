LPT: Don't laugh at / mock someone for their laugh. It will make them self conscious about it and could stop them from wanting to laugh at all. You'll miss their laugh (and their happiness) when it's gone.

A friend of mine kind of sounds like a donkey/hyena mix with breathing difficulties when he laughs.   
It's just the way it is. He knows what he sounds like but it's pretty damn hard to change how you laugh! And why should you! People would regularly comment and/or laugh at him for his laugh. So he tried to catch himself when about to laugh and did a pretty good job of just stopping laughing altogether. When he does laugh he goes from that initial look of joy to almost immediate self conscious fear and embarrassment and tries to stop himself from laughing. He looks sad and I feel sad that he can't just enjoy the moment. He laughs a lot less now and it will take him a long time to laugh freely again, if he even manages it at all. I miss his laugh and more importantly the happiness I used to see in him.
