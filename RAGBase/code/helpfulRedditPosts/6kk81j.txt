LPT: With the 4th of July coming up, all you Americans don't forget to check your yard perimeters/cages if you have strictly outside dogs. Make sure they're safe and secure with fireworks going off so they don't run away.

Edit:  Guys, not everybody spends the vast majority of time inside on the internet. There are plenty of people that have outside dogs and especially work dogs that get plenty of exercise, stimulation and attention. Just because you have shitty neighbors doesn't mean every outside dog is abused.
