LPT If you’re heading to a busy cafe or restaurant that doesn’t take bookings arrange meet your friends at 10 minutes to the hour (9:50am or 6:50pm) instead of on the hour. You’ll beat out everyone who arranged to meet on the hour and get seated much sooner.

EDIT: A lot of people in this thread seem to have an issue with punctuality. Being on time is a show of respect for the people you’re meeting with. It tells them that you respect their time enough to arrive on time and not leave them waiting. I don’t really understand the problem - plan ahead, account for traffic, leave time for parking and walking to the venue... what am I missing??
