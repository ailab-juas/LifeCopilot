LPT: If You Ever Have To Live In Your Car... How To Save Money &amp; Be Comfortable!

content:
**Bring Milk Crates For More Surface Area:**  If you have a small car like I do, you probably won't be able to sleep comfortably in the back seat due to the lack of surface area.  In reference this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_Usqf7aNxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Usqf7aNxg)), you can place milk crates in your backseat and cover them with blankets to increase your sleep surface area.  You might even be able to extend your legs all the way!  If you still can't, like me, it's still quite comfortable.  I cycle through 3 sleep positions:

1. Back against the seat, head facing the windshield, legs 90% extended over milk crates.  This is known as the "J Sleeping Position" in the YouTube video
2. Butt resting against front seats with most of body on the milk crates, head facing the direction of the rear windshield.  Leg extension will probably be about 70%.
3. Face down with right leg near a 90 degree angle on top of the milk crates, and left leg 100% extended into the crevice between the passenger seat and the door.

**How To Wash Dishes:** When you finish your meal, use paper towels to wipe out all the food scraps that are left on your utensils, plates, and bowls.  After it looks completely empty, use a dish brush, a bit of water, and some dishsoap to lather up all your things with soap.  After they're all lathered up, use a squirt bottle of water (to direct and conserve water) to wash off all the soap.  Ideally, you would use very hot water, but that's not always realistic.

**Cover Your Windows:**  You should cover your windows, not only for privacy, but so you have an easier time sleeping at night without as much light coming in.  You can cut out black plastic to cover your driver-side windows &amp; place them by rolling up your window to trap the plastic so it dangles down.  Your windshield can easily be covered by a traditional sun cover, usually used to block the sun's heat from getting trapped in your car.  Your rear-windows are best covered with a window sleeve that acts as a bug net, this way you reduce the transparency of the window, but more importantly you can open the windows a crack and get ventilation without risking any bugs from coming in.  The best way I found to cover the rear windshield is with black plastic placed from the interior of the car, and using strong magnets to hold it (placed on the interior and exterior of the car).  This is all partly shown in this  Youtube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_Usqf7aNxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Usqf7aNxg)

**Getting &amp; Storing Water:**  Some people recommend asking businesses to use their water supply (visible outside the building) to fill up your water tanks, but I haven't had success with that.  It's hard to find, the employees usually don't know the water supply exists or if they're allowed to allow you to use it, and I usually just get told no.  Instead, I fill up a 5 gallon jerry can with water at the grocery stores, which is great because this water is meant for drinking.  This means you can get clean water super cheap for both drinking and bathing.  For storing your shower water, you put it in a 5 gallon bucket with a waterproof sealing lid.  For drinking water, you can keep it in your 5 gallon canister and pour it into water jugs (using a funnel) whenever you run low in your bottles.

**How To Accessibly Cook Quickly &amp; Easily Anywhere &amp; Store Fuel:**  I can't give tips on how to cook quickly and easily without making product recommendations, which is not allowed in this group.  As for storing fuel, I can't make this recommendation blatantly for all fuel as they have different temperature storage requirements.  For the fuel I use, which I cannot mention due to the rules, I've been recommended to store it under the passenger seat (to minimize exposure to heat) and I haven't had any problems.  When storing fuel, make sure you park your car under shade whenever possible (during hot days) and put the sun visor up in your windshield to block some heat.

**How To Find Work**: I can't recommend specific places to find work due to the rules, but what I can do is recommend freelancing and/or independent contracting gigs (which let you choose your own schedule, who you do business with, and where you work).  Although, it seems the US may pass legislation to remove most (accessible) contractor work and consider it employment, which would remove contracting's beneficial, flexibile qualities.  Keep an eye on that!

**Eat All Your Meals at Once (Unless You Eat Out):**  If you're working while you live in your car, it's really impossible to cook 3 meals a day due to all the prep-time, eating-time, and clean-up-time it takes.  You can fall into a pattern of eating one meal a day without feeling hungry, but please ensure you're eating enough calories for your age, weight, etc.  You should probably also see a doctor to make sure it's safe to do for you.  It saves a lot of time and makes the day's routines so much easier.

**Do Your Own Laundry:**  Laundromats can get expensive if you go frequently, and you may not have even brought enough clothes with you to get through a few days without doing laundry.  Some people do their own laundry in buckets, but it seems like too much set-up and too much water.  I had success doing 1-2 loads of laundry per day in a "wash bag."  It takes literally 5-7 minutes to wash &amp; rinse each load of laundry.  To dry it fast, you can "squeegee" the clothes with your hand to get any leftover water  out, then place it with maximum surface area exposed onto a laid out towel.  After all your clothes are laid out onto the towel, you can roll up the towel with the clothes in it until it looks like a long snake.  Then, you can squeeze, press, and even put your knees all across the towel a few times to get as much water absorbed from the clothes into the towel's fibers.  After this is done, you can hang a clothesline with paracord in the woods from tree to tree to hang your laundry by clothespins in the sun.  Personally, and this might not be healthy, I hang my laundry on a clothesline in the back seat of my car with a towel laid underneath, and I try to park my car in locations where the clothes will be exposed to sunlight.  By the end of the day, the clothes are almost always completely dry, even on cloudy, rainy days.

**Go To A Real Laundromat 1x a Month:**  The towel you use to dry your clothes should definitley be washed, but it's probably too big to fit in a wash bag.  Your blankets are also likely too big.  This is why I take all my stuff to the laundromat for one "real" wash a month.  Just because I'm going, I also include all my clothes which are ordinarily washed by the wash bag, as well as my pillowcases and anything else I can find that might need a wash.

**The Cheapest &amp; Most Accessible Shower Option:** Some people use gym memberships to have consistent access to a shower, but gyms can be expensive and if you're traveling, you won't always have access to the same gym, and you probably don't want to have 10 different gym memberships.We're going old-school and using a bucket full of water.  I take my jerry can full of water and fill up a 5 gallon bucket about halfway.  I go out into the woods with a "shower tent" (for privacy), a change of clothes, flip flops, a bucket of water, shampoo/soap/hygiene items, a small towel, a bag (holding most of this), and a canteen.  I set up the shower tent and fill up my backpack full of all the clothes I was previously wearing.  I then put my bag of clothes and shoes outside the tent, while I'm nude wearing flipflops inside the tent.  Then, I use a canteen to pickup some water from the bucket and do 1 big dunk of water over my head, trying to get it to run over my whole body.  I take a 2nd canteen full of water to wash over areas I missed (armpits, groin, etc).  1st thing I wash is my hair with shampoo.  Then I lather up with soap all over my body.  After that, I take about 5 or 6 canteens full of water to wash off the soap with water.  Most of the time when I wash my body, since I'm pretty tall, I do it in a crouched position so I can hold the canteen above my head in the shower tent.  After I'm all washed off, I dry off with the small towel and start putting on my clothes except my socks.  I go outside the tent to sit down on a rock and dry off my feet and put on my socks and shoes (without getting the socks wet).  I usually try to shower around 6 or 7am when there's less people around and there's daylight (and there aren't mosquitos everywhere).  If you have leftover water in your bucket, you can put a waterproof sealing lid over the top of it to store the bucket safely in your car.

**How To Be Covert:** It's hard to be covert about sleeping in your car because you'll have black plastic hanging on the outside when you're sleeping, and during the day you'll have laundry in your back seat.  I don't have a solution for any of that.  But, in the morning, when you shower, you might have some serious stage fright if there's people around.  What I like to do is pretend I'm going for an early morning workout into the woods (usually of a park or hiking trail).  My backpack carries all my hygiene items so no one sees them.  I carry the bucket full of water with the lid on as if I'm going for a workout carrying heavy stuff into the woods.  Over my clothes I'm wearing an overlay warm-up/workout jacket and pants.  That way, when I shower and change clothes and come back, I'll still have the overlay jacket and everything over it, so people won't see the change of clothes and won't be suspicious.  Also, in the event someone comes across you in your tent and asks what's going on, you can make up a lame excuse (and see if they accept it) that you saw a tick on your body and wanted to do a quick tick check before you return to your car (so the tick doesn't escape into your car).  I haven't had anyone come across me before.  One of the most important parts of being covert when showering is actually going deep enough into the woods, off the hiking trail, to be away from people for the short time you'll spend showering.

**Where To Sleep**: You can sleep in most Walmart parking lots without having to buy anything.  Some Walmarts don't allow people to park there, so you might consider calling the Walmart before you come.  You can also sleep in truck stops, but I'd recommend doing your research to make sure it's popular and big enough so that you'd feel safe.  There are apps with listed places you can park for the night, and some truck stop apps tell you how many parking spaces their truck stops have (so you can guage popularity).

**Security:**  Never tell anyone where you're sleeping or even that you're sleeping in your car.  If you feel unsafe where you're parked, find a new place to park for the night.  I recommend carrying a knife and/or pepper spray if you feel comfortable.  At the very least, carry a loud whistle.  Always lock your doors at night.  Have a flashlight/lantern accessible and nearby.  If you're exceptionally worried about getting mugged or things stolen from you, I've heard a tip where people wear a fly fishing vest underneath their clothes and keep all their important possessions in its pockets.  If someone mugs you quickly, they'll probably just ask you to empty your pockets and it'd be too difficulty/long to have you take off all your clothes and then unzipper your pockets and empty them.  Other than that, always make sure someone knows where you are and where you're going, checks up with you in the morning to make sure you're safe, and are "on-call" in case you call or text them in an emergency.

NOTE: **I do not sleep in my car full-time**.  I go every once in a while for 5-7 day (or so) bouts because I find it enjoyable.  The 1st thing I wanted to do when I started this was find strategies to make car-living comfortable and easy.  I really hope these tips find someone in need and helps them strategize a way to do so **comfortably** and **frugally.**

Updates:

**Charging Electronics**: You can get a power bank that holds a long charge.  Use this to charge things like your fan, phone, smaller power banks, laptop, etc.  The best place for charging things that I've found are public libraries.  A great way to access wifi, get work done, keep in touch with people, etc, all while your power bank charges.  Look for power banks that can charge a laptop 2-3+ times.

**Staying Cool In The Summer**:  Getting an electric car fan (that works by USB) will save your sanity in the summer.  You can place it between the driver and passenger seat at night and direct it either at you, or at the ceiling to circulate the air.  I don't think living in a car can be comfortable in the heat without a quality fan.
