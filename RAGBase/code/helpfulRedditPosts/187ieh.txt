LPT: If you receive a spam text message, forward it to 7726 (SPAM). Your carrier (all of them) will reply asking for the number it came from. This helps them put a stop to unsolicited ads for their customers.

I learned this while I was working for Verizon Wireless, but all of the carriers have a similar service on their networks. Believe it or not, the carriers don't want their customers getting unsolicited ads as it reflects poorly on their service. 

Also, if the message appears to be coming from an email address, you can send that in reply, too.
