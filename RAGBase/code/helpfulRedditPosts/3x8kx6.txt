LPT: If you're apologizing to someone, don't end it with "but..(this is why I did what I did)"

content:
That's not an apology, and it sounds like you're not sincere, you're just making an excuse.

Lay out what you did wrong and ask for forgiveness, that's all you have to do.

Edit: If you know you fucked up, just say it. Saying "but blah blah blah" tells the other person you're not really sorry.

Edit 2: I'm talking about when you know you fucked up something. I was hoping you guys would know what I was talking about. We should go back to LPT: Always lock your doors when you go on vacation.

Edit 3: /u/VortexOfTime is the hero. He hit the nail on the head.

"This is actually an issue my SO and I have been working on.

"I'm sorry for this, that, and the other, but here are the reasons and excuses." Using but places the importance in the words that follow, not the actual apology itself. Simply flipping the statements around makes a world of difference to the person you're apologizing to. "Here are the reasons and excuses, and for this, that, and the other I'm sorry."

And I'm sorry is so much more constructive than I'm sorry, but."

Edit 4: This is a LPT for people who have actually done something wrong, and they know it. Don't say but...

Interesting conversation, tho.
