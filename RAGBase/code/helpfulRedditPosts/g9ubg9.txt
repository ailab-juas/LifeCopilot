title:
LPT: Don’t threaten to call the police on someone, just do it.

content:
My therapist gave me this advice when I was going through a divorce and forced to live with an increasingly violent soon-to-be ex for a short period. I felt REALLY stupid for a few of the calls I had to make, but it was the only way to get his behavior/intimidation to stop immediately.

If you are to a point where you feel you need to threaten to call the police to stop someone else’s behavior, you probably should just call.

If you continually threaten to call, and never follow through, they will learn really quickly that you most likely won’t, and the threat won’t work anymore, and your situation will most likely get worse.
