LPT: Zip up your hoodies before you put them in the dryer and the zippers won’t get wavy.

content:
Wavy zippers are the worst and make baby Jesus cry.

Edit: Hey, this kinda blew up, thanks for the awards! I want to elevate some good comments that folks have made: 

1.) Line drying is always your best bet if your climate / space allows. 

2.) Drying on Low / delicate, potentially in a lingerie bag is the next best thing to line drying. 

3.) Don’t blast your hoodies on high heat in the dryer in any case, it’s bad news. 

4.) Folks have mentioned that the zipper will go wavy anyway if you zip it or not, it just depends on the heat since the fabric is shrinking either way (and that I am full of hooey - cheeky ;) ) Honestly, that hasn’t been my experience, I will say it would probably be better not to dry them on anything above low heat, but when I have dried them on higher heat  (I don’t love some of my hoodies and I am often lazy and in a hurry) being zipped up produces far less zipper waviness than unzipped. I’m not sure if this is because the fabric is shrinking away from the zipper in a uniform manner when zipped or something, but just conveying my experience. Don’t nuke your beloved zip-up hoodie on nuclear blast setting while zipped up just to be safe - check out the tips above if you wanna preserve it for the aliens who will discover our civilization eons from now.  But if you’re lazy like me, medium-high zipped up seems to work reasonably well.
