LPT:If you think your dog has a wound in its mouth, the easiest way to see inside the dogs mouth is to play with a see through plastic bottle

I have a German Shepard who spent the day scratching/scraping the side her nose, as if there was an imaginary stick in her mouth.

 She did not take kindly to dozens of attempts for me to hold open her mouth long enough (Alsatians often twist their head and reverse in this situation), so that I could see what the problem was. She was obviously irritated/in pain.

Eventually I came up with the idea that if I can get her to bite upon an empty Coke bottle (with the cap screwed on, so the bottle does not compress), I would be able to see what the problem was. This worked perfectly.

 Like a paranoid dad, I expected a bloody gash, a mouth tumor or something terrible. Luckily it was just a stick caught in in the roof of her mouth. I did not have time for a photo but it looks a bit like this: http://imgur.com/Qgn5ieq

The stick was removed by twisting it with a small pair of pincers, my SO is a vet. *I do not recommend this should be done without knowing what you are doing.*

Kaela, a few hours after the stick was removed:
