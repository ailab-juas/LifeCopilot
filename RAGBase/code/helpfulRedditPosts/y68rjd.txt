YSK: Bathing cats is often unnecessarily and could be harmful

content:
I see a lot of posts on reddit about people bathing their cats unnecessarily. The only times it's necessary to bathe your cats is when they have something on them that they shouldn't lick off (for example, mine fell in a still body of water, invested with algae and whatnot and I didn't want her consuming that water through grooming), when they have flea's, when you have sphinx or when the cat has special needs. 

When bathing cats regularly without it being necessary, you wash off the oils on their skin that keep their skin healthy and you could give them emotional trauma. 

Most cats effectively clean themselves, they don't need our help.

Why YSK: bathing cats can be harmful and is often unnecessary.
