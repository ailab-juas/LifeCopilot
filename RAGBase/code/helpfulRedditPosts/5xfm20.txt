title:
LPT: Debates and arguments end. If you find the conversation circling, it's not a debate, it's someone trying to out talk you.

content:
Debates and arguments will be sourced with a definitive goal. If the topic keeps skipping to new points, or they focus only on a small mistake.

It's a troll, not someone looking to learn or discuss.
