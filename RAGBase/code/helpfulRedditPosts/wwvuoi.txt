YSK itâ€™s extremely expensive to have guests at a wedding!

content:
Why YSK: Because itâ€™s expensive and so awkward/rude to confront ppl about not getting invitedâ€¦.And 9/10 times itâ€™s a money issueâ€¦. 


Venues jump in price significantly once you need capacity for more than 75 ppl, Iâ€™m talking like $7,000-$10,000 more 


Catering for more than 100-150? Your gunna be looking at $50 a plate MINIMUM.


You need more seating for the ceremony and reception? Youâ€™re looking at an extra 2,000-4,000 just for chairs ðŸ¥²


DONT EVEN GOT ME STARTED ON DESERTS/CAKE.


I work in the wedding industry and I hear brides talk all the time about how they didnâ€™t get to invite as many people as they would like because their budget was smaller, but that doesnâ€™t stop obscure aunts or cousins you havenâ€™t heard from in 15 years from asking why they didnâ€™t get invited. 


Not to mention coworkers and bosses, like have you ever taken your coworker or boss out to a dinner??? have they ever taken you out to dinner of $100 or more?no! because itâ€™s inappropriate and way too much money to spend on someone you only have a working relationship with.


And stop with the meal requests every request or change a caterer or venue has to make to their menu to accommodate a guest, cost the bride and groom anywhere from an extra $25 to an extra $150 on top of an already extremely expensive meal that they are providing for you free of cost.
