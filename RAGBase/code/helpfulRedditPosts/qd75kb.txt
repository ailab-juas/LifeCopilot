title:
LPT: Cars as status symbols is a really stupid game that you do not want to play.

content:
1) Most of the people driving nice cars cannot afford them they just don’t know it. 

2) The impression someone gets because you drive a 2015 Lexus is exactly the same as if you are driving a 2019 Lexus because it’s all just smoke and mirrors anyway. 

3) The social pressure of the “car as a status symbol” scam causes people to buy nice cars like BMW’s, Mercedes, Etc.. when they can’t afford the payments, can’t afford the insurance, and certainly cannot afford the maintenance and repairs which leads me to

4) If you are a regular person and you are buying at BMW you are going to buy one in your shopping range which means more miles, then since you can’t afford the proper maintenance you end up paying $3500 for a clutch. 


Just do yourself a favor and don’t buy into it all. 

Don’t get me wrong please. Buy the car that makes you happy, just do it for the right reasons because “cars as a status symbol” is just a big sham. You want to get from point a to point b safely and reliably until you can ACTUALLY afford that nice car.
