LPT: Never accept more work than you can do with 100% quality

content:
I’ve made a huge mistake where I was overloaded with 10-15 projects while my colleagues only had 2-3, the manager kept adding more to me since I’m fast and just accept them with only some  complaining that the load is too much and I can’t monitor them all, but deep in my heart I thought I may get promotion or raise.

The quality of my projects were lower and many mistakes happened, I was working for almost 12 hours a day but I looked like I’m lazy, weak, bad PM..Later in a meeting ( after the big mistake) where my boss discussed that I suck and he admitted that he overloaded me by a lot but said that is not an excuse and you could follow up with many other ways..while my colleagues with less than 20% of my workload looked like they are much better PMs.

I’m only blaming myself as I wasn’t smart enough to notice what is happening, the sad thing is my salary is much lower than them lol.
