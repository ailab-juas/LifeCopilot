LPT: Sharp knives are far safer than dull knives

content:
Arguably the most important tool in the kitchen is a sharp knife. Not only will it make your life far easier doing mise-en-place, it will also lower your risk of injury. A dull blade requires pressure to cut, increasing your chance of slipping, or lack of traction. This can result in unsafe practices, such as poking the tip of the blade into an ingredient, or using one hand to press the spine of the blade into an ingredient. A well maintained blade on the other hand almost "glides" through an ingredients' surface, giving you more control, lowering risk of accident, and potentially improving your cutting skills. Goodbye uneven cuts, and mangled tomatoes!

Sharpening your blades is also easy. You can do it at home with a handheld sharpener, these are the easiest for a DIYer, and most inexpensive. A whetstone is a step above handheld sharpeners and requires more time, money, and skill. However, this effort will result in the most even and sharp blade. If you don't feel safe doing it yourself, there may be local stores near you that offer sharpening services that are relatively cheap and quick, but effective. 


Bonus: Do you hate cutting onions because they make you cry? A well kept blade does less damage to cell structure lowering the release of that horrible tear causing gas!
