LPT: If you often order food through takeaway services like Just Eat, try finding a takeaway and then going to the restaurant's own website. Many have their own delivery service and will offer a discount if you order directly from them, as they don't have to pay a commission to the takeaway service.

Companies like Just Eat, Uber Eats, and Deliveroo commonly take 20-30% commission on each order. So many places will happily offer discounts of around 10-15% if it means they don't have to pay this additional charge.
