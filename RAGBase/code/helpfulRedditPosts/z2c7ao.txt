LPT: If you know you will be late for a meeting (personal or professional), itâ€™s always better to inform the person in advance than trying to make it on time.

content:
Majority of the people, upon realizing that they will be late for a meeting, try really hard to haste and make it in time. If you have already realized that you will be late, the likelihood of you being on time by doing a few things in haste is extremely low whereas the likelihood of you doing something utterly stupid, like driving recklessly, being mad at someone or neglecting something important in the spur of the moment is really high. This could not just be harmful to you but unsafe for others too who have nothing to do with your situation.

On the other hand, if/when you call up a person in advance and inform them that you will be late and then actually make it by the new time, this results in - 1. The other person respecting you for respecting their time and being clear on expectations 2. You coming across as an aware and empathetic person who respects timeline instead of a careless person always running late and trying to catch up
