LPT: If you’re writing an essay and need to proofread it. Copy and paste your document to naturalreaders.com so that an automated voice can read it out loud. This way, you can catch mistakes easier and faster.

content:
You can also adjust the voice of the person reading it, as well as the speed. I use this as the last step in proofreading my essays, because even after reading them out loud myself, I always miss something. There’s a daily 20 minute reading limit, so for longer essays it might not work. However, you can increase this by paying monthly for it. 

Also another website: ttsreader.com! 

Let’s get those A’s, everyone!

Edit: Thank you for my first award!! Also, ty to everyone posting other alternatives in the comments! 

I usually use Google Docs because I don’t have Word, and Google Translate has a text limit so I have to look for other websites. I also don’t pay the monthly fee for the websites either, but the free version is a nicer alternative than reading my essays out loud for the 50th time.

Edit 2: aaaaa!!! Thank you so much for the awards once again!! :D !!
