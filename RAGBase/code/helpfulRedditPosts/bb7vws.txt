YSK: about garlic mustard, an invasive species found all throughout the America that kills trees by releasing chemicals into the soil. Info on it in comments

content:
So garlic mustard is a super bad invasive species in America that is killing our trees. It grows fast and it releases chemicals that kill the fungus trees need to survive. The plant is easy to Id and easy to remove so I figured I would post about it so if you all are going hiking or around your house you can remove. Furthermore it is edible and makes a damn good pesto sauce for pasta which I highly recommend. The plant can be found throughout the year but is probably most easily identified when it's full grown as it has many white flowers and spikes https://imgur.com/gallery/VEQIcDA. 

Here are some links to provide some information on it. it.https://emswcd.org/removing-garlic-mustard/

America is truly a beautiful country and if more people lended a helping hand we can help keep it beautiful. Even if you just kill it when it's full grown stopping it from producing seeds it's very helpful. Hope this was informative.



Edit: this blew up a lot more than expected so I just wanted to to include this. https://www.fohvos.info/project/nrcs-smartphone-app/ this is a link the the nj invasives species strike team app. Really useful app for the tristate area that has a lot of info and using it helps them collect data to properly manag invasive. Also if you want to get more involved contact you local fish and wildlife they constantly have invasive removal days. They NEED YOUR HELP. You can learn a lot and it can do some real good. Also you local university if it has an ecology program will probably be looking for some volunteers. Hope this helps invasive removal can be a hell of a lot of fun so, enjoy it!
