title:
LPT: When angry with a company you are calling on the phone, calmly explain to the employee you are speaking with that you are upset with the company policy instead of with the employee specifically. Then apologize in advance for any frustration that may come through due to those policies.

I often say things like "I want to start by saying I am very upset with your company and how it's treated me, but I know you personally don't make any policies and are not the one that messed up.  So any frustration that happens is not because of you."

This tends to make the employee have no doubts on if they upset you, and often makes them want to go above and beyond because instead of dealing with someone yelling at them, they are dealing with someone upset at a situation they might be able to help with.

It goes without saying to make sure not to yell at the employee, and instead keep your anger focused on the policies and company.
