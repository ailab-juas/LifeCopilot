title:
LPT for people who work on their feet all day. Have and extra pair of socks to change out mid day. Add in a different pair of shoes for extra relief.

content:
The socks are pretty self explanatory, dry socks=happy feet. The different pair of shoes/boots is something I've had to learn on my own. From someone who has chronic feet pain, this is a great tactic for quick pain relief because different types of boots put pressure in different places.
