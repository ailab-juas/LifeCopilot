LPT: If you intend to order pizza on Halloween, plan ahead.

content:
Halloween is by and large the busiest day of the year in the pizza industry (in the US; Super Bowls can be a close second depending on what city you're in on that particular year). And this year, Halloween falling on a Friday is going to compound on that.

If you're on a schedule, need it before a certain time, or have a large order, it is best to place the order earlier in the day if not some day prior. 

Call hold times will also be up, so be prepared to wait on the line if you call during or around dinner; hanging up and calling back will only put you at the back of the queue. 999 times out 1000, you were not forgotten.

Have your order ready (as best as you can) when you call. The absolute worst offender to long hold times are calls that take an unnecessarily long time to complete.

I've worked at 6 pizza shops in 3 cities in 2 states over 10 years and not one ever gave even a single employee Halloween off. So while they will most certainly be staffed to the brim, still assume that it may take upwards of an hour to receive your order, and do not expect the drivers to rush through trick-or-treaters roaming the evening streets.

Have a safe and happy Halloween!
