LPT: when punishing children it is good practice to inform them what they did is wrong, why it is wrong, and what they can do better. If you can't articulate these things, then you should examine why you are giving out a punishment in the first place.

content:
I have worked with a lot of people. A lot of parents do not understand the difference between their emotional response to a misbehaving child and the lesson needed to actually fix the misbehavior. Consistent punishment without context breeds children fearful of trying anything new or angering peers. It is a slippery slope to child abuse.

Edit: Thank you Reddit for your feedback, your stories, your support, and yes even your acerbic, nit-picky criticism. May you ever become a more decent person than the last.
