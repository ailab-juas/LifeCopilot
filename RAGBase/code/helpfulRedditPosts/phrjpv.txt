LPT: Don't fall in love with a place you are vacationing at. You are seeing that area for a week or two, when you are not working and you are under less stress than you would be at home. I've seen too many people uproot their lives to move to "paradise" only to find out it's not what it seems.

Edit: Wow, it's been a lively morning with lots of discussion surrounding this topic! Exactly what Reddit was originally meant to do.

For those of you who got hurt or offended by my LPT, I don't apologize. It is my perspective from a guy living in a tourist area and this is what I see.

Remember, I might be a dick, or maybe I'm not a dick, who knows? And who cares, this is the internet.
