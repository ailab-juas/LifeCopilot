**If all else fails:**

1) Wrap in a thin but waterproof layer of plastic, stick it into a clean bathtub

2) Cover with cold water, then use trial and error to make water in = water out.
 
3) Insert bendy straw into oversized alcoholic beverage of choice 

4) Browse comments for other holiday LPTs.
