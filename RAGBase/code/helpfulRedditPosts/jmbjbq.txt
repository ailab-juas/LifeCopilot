LPT: When getting into a new hobby, buy second hand first. If you end up loving the hobby save up and apply the buy once cry once principal.

Many times we get into hobbies and they don't quite pan out. Buying used means you spend considerably less than new and should be able to recoup a decent amount. 

Once you know you love the hobby you should buy the best that you can afford. Often times folks get an entry level item, spend a bunch on upgrading then eventually go with a premium level gear. Skip the upgrades and save some money!
