LPT: Never, ever, EVER pay for the "bring it back empty" gas deal from a car rental agency.

content:
As someone who was "gotcha'd" recently after not traveling for several years, figured I'd share this, even if it's a re-share, given the price of gas recently.

They'll try to sell you on the price per gallon, but keep in mind you're (edit: "generally") paying for a full tank of gas at the price they're sharing. If you return the car with a half tank of gas, you'd have to be paying twice the price of gas nearby (or more) for their deal to be worth it.

In short, it's a perfectly legal scam, and if you're starting to travel again, do yourself a favor and don't fall for it. Pay for the (often only cents more per gallon) price of gas within a mile or two.

Edit: At the very least, be sure to clarify the terms and conditions at the counter to help clear any of the fine print ambiguity, or just do a quick search of the closest gas station to your rental car return location (usually there's one within a couple of miles, but not always).

Edit 2: United States LPT, regional practices may vary
