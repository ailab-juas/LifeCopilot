title:
LPT: When asking a friend or co-worker for a favor, make small talk (such as "so how was your new years holiday?") after the request, not before.

content:
Even if you *are* really interested in the small talk, switching the subject from "by the way, I need _____ and _____" will come off as if you only wanted the favor. If you get what you need *first* and then say "by the way, how was your new years?" it won't seem like you just chatted them up to get what you want &amp; it's more likely the conversation will be remembered as a positive exchange among friends, rather than just business.  
&amp;nbsp;  
EDIT: Many of you are suggesting that this is some sort of manipulative tactic or that I'm an asshole. Whatever, internet. This is not to say "hey guys do this when you want to manipulate people into doing what you want!". It's a suggestion for the daily conversations we *all* have to help your true interest be displayed properly. Do you need a hug?
