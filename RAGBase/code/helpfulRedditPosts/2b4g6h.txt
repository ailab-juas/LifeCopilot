"For her final project for a master's degree in food studies at New York University, Leanne Brown created a practical cookbook, titled Good and Cheap: A Healthy Cookbook for Food Stamp Budgets, which includes over 130 pages of recipes that fit into a $4 a day food budget. Originally written with the intent to help poor families, who may receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, to eat better, the cookbook is a great reference for anyone trying to stretch their grocery budget. Brown is giving away her cookbook as a free PDF download from her website."

Though it's targeted for those on food stamps, I think this also applies to college students, the frugal, or anybody learning to cook or wanting to keep things in a budget. I know when I first started cooking, my greatest challenge was not buying overly-specific ingredients for a single recipe, only to be confused with what to do with the rest and have it go bad. This cookbook is basic, cheap, and a good starting, middle, or ending place for just about anyone.
