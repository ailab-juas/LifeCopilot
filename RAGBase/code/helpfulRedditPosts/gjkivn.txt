LPT: If you read, hear, or see something and immediately get defensive, stop and collect yourself. While you may feel strong in your convictions, that feeling is an indication you never allowed yourself a chance to open your mind to something new.

For example, if a friend gives you a piece of advice and your first reaction is to explain why that advice won't work for you, then you're missing out on a chance to improve. You should instead stop and consider what they said. While in some cases you will still disagree, honest reflection and contemplation can open your mind up to positive change. It is more important to accept new knowledge and live closer to your ideal self than it is to be right. Same goes for learning about anything that contradicts what you previously thought. Give it honest consideration.

Edit 2:  To everyone saying this does not apply to \*something obviously very immoral\* I am not saying you should be okay with any opinion in existence. Often times your opinion has facts, values, and reasoning to support it and the counter argument has nothing. I'm not claiming both sides have equal value. I am saying that if you're opinion is as rooted in facts, values, and reasoning as you think it is, then reassessing it won't change anything, so there is nothing to fear in doing so. While I don't think you need to reevaluate every belief you have all the time, I do think that willingness to reevaluate any belief will help prevent you from holding a belief that if you were to give it an honest look you would completely change your mind.
