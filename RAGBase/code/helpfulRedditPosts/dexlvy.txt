LPT : If you're stuck in an unproductive rut, take a day off from self-pressure. It sounds counter-productive, but I don't mean a day off watching netflix or lazing around. That's still the rut. Go for a walk/ go to a pottery cafe/ gallery/ museum or indulge in a hobby.

It's a lot easier to motivate yourself to do, since it's a nice thing, and once it's over, you're out of the rut of doing nothing. You'll feel refreshed and ready to tackle the harder work. Days off that include being out of the house are best, but home hobbies work too.
