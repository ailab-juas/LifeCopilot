YSK how to survive a stampede

content:
Why YSK: You could be caught in a crowd or a stampede and and feel like you don't  have much control over the situation, but there are a few things you can do to protect yourself.

To resist pushing forces, you should stand with your fists up and legs apart as if you froze while boxing. This stance is more stable and keeping your fists raised protects your lungs from crushing forces more effectively.

Avoid falling down as much as possible, but if you do fall, curl into a ball with your hands protecting your skull and lie on your side. This will protect your vital organs better than lying on your back or your stomach.
