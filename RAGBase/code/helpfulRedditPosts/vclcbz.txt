LPT: When traveling, turn dirty clothes inside-out. This way you’ll always know what’s still clean vs already dirty!

content:
This is most useful on trips where you need to repeatedly pack and unpack, like multi-day, multi-city itineraries. 

Make sure all your clothes are right side-out at the outset.

Then choose your clothes from the right side-out batch, and when you return it to your suitcase, turn it inside-out.

This buys you some time before you have to resort to the sniff test!
