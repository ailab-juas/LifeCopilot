title:
YSK riding in a car with your feet on the dash is dangerous

content:
I see this all the time and all I can think about is how bad off they're going to be if there's an accident. The force of the crash and the airbags are just going to fold you in half and press your shins/knees into your face.

  


Please, if you put your feet up on the dash, stop.
