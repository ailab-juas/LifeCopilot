LPT: Fellow male employers - period pains can be extremely debilitating. Don’t begrudge a persons need to take regular time off work for a natural process they have no control over.

content:
Not only should it be a common decency, you’ll earn the respect of your female employees and ultimately provide a more comfortable workspace for those who need it, resulting in higher staff satisfaction, quality of work and retention.

Edit: Good grief. Some of the comments from men in here. A few of you are absolute pricks and I sincerely hope you're never in a position where you manage women. I'm so sorry women have to deal with people like that. We must do more to make sure these people aren't allowed to dominate the debate.
