LPT: Cheer up some one who is cranky with a Jedi Mind Trick

content:
Let me start off by saying that this is a ridiculously simple trick. It works best on children but I have used it on grown ups as well. That being said I still use it all the time since it can be so effective. Hopefully some one out there can use it to cheer some one up.

First you need a some one who is grumpy (they don't *have* to be grumpy but it makes it easier). Tell the person that if they don't cheer up you will use a Jedi Mind Trick on them. You will typically get a response along the lines of "there is no such thing" or "that's stupid". This attitude is actually helpful for the trick to work.

Then, with a dead serious look on your face, look them directly in the eyes. Hold their gaze for a second or two and say "smile". (I told you it was ridiculously simple)

In my experience they will crack a smile in under 10 seconds even if they don't want to. Once they start to smile they will giggle a bit because your Jedi Mind trick was effective even though they thought it was a waste of time.

Once they smile for a couple of seconds their mood will lighten a bit.

 This trick works best on younger kids but I do it to my wife when she is feeling grouchy and it still works every time. Also, the trick has a cumulative effect. My oldest son who is now 15 will crack a smile every time I tell him I'm going to use my Jedi skills on him if he doesn't cheer up. Any one with teenagers knows this can be particularly useful since teenagers generally have something bothering them.

To be clear, when I say "grumpy" or "cranky" I do not mean angry or pissed off. This works best on folks that are just a little agitated or mildly frustrated. If they are *really* upset you're on your own.

Use your new found powers wisely.
