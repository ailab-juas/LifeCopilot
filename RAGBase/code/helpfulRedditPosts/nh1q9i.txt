LPT: even if you aren't concerned about security, always latch/lock your doors anyways. Wind gusts can be really strong, and raccoons have thumbs.

I'm in SE michigan, the weather is unseasonably warm and the evenings have been a wonderful 60Â°F lately. For me, that means every window in the house open all day and night!

I have a significant distance between me and my neighbors, and a balcony that looks into some woods. The frogs at night and the birds in the morning are wonderful to relax to. However, I underestimated how good raccoons are at climbing.

Despite having no stairs on my balcony, when I went to get water at 2:30 a.m. last night, a raccoon was curiously exploring my balcony. If he wanted to, he could have simply slid open the screen door and gotten into the house. I know I can't stop them from exploring, but those doors will remain latched at night from now on!
