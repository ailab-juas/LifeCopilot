LPT How to parallel park every time.

content:
1) put on your blinker. Don't let that asshole behind you creep up on you. 

2) Pull up beside the car in front of the space. Exactly beside them. Your back bumpers should be pretty much lined up.

3) Cut the wheel **all the way** to the right and back up watching your right side view mirror. 

4) Stop backing up as soon **as you can no longer see the car parked in the space behind you** in your right mirror.

5) straighten the wheel out and back **straight back** until the front of your car can clear the back bumper of the front car.

6) Cut the wheel **all the way** to the left and continue backing into the space

7) Once you're in the spot straighten your wheel out and make sure you leave about equal room in front of and behind your car

YOU'RE AWESOME AT PARALLEL PARKING!!!!

If you need to get a bit closer to the curb remember that each time you scoot forward or back you'll need to cut the wheel AND straighten it out with each back and forth. If you don't do both your literally just retracing your own tracks.

Edit: this method works for me every time. If you have a weird shaped car then sorry, you're on your own (this is a good method to start with though!)

Edit 2: Woah, hey everybody. Turns out I posted this late at night, so many of you drive on the other side of the road. Sorry about that. I guess if you switch all the directions it still might work? Idk I've never done it that way. 

Also, yes, in America there is usually a parallel parking element on driving tests, however a lot of people don't have to parallel park often and forget how or stress out and block roads trying to do it when they are visiting new cities. I've gotten spaces from people who just couldn't figure it out and drove away to look for a normal space, and I've had several people comment on how fast I can park so I figured this would be a decent LPT.
