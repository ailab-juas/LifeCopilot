YSK: If you find a lost dog that's wearing a collar but no tags, check the buckle

content:
Why YSK: it's very easy to buy a collar with a metal buckle that can be engraved with the owner's contact info so that the dog doesn't need to wear a jingly tag. There's also 'low profile' tags that slip onto the webbing of the collar that can display information. 
Tl;Dr: no tags doesn't mean no contact information.
