YSK that if you’re unsure what medications do and don’t work together, you can always call Poison Control and ask them what is safe to take or avoid. Never feel bad about this, as their stated purpose is to be a proactive measure as much as a reactive aid

This time of year we’re all getting a bit sick and if you’re not sure if you can cross a painkiller with cold medicine or allergy pills it never hurts to ask. Of course, you can always call or visit your pharmacy, but if there isn’t one nearby poison control will always pick up the phone. 

The American National Poison Control hotline is 1-800-222-1222, but if you live outside the states they will still take your call, and it’s toll free!

You can also text ‘POISON’ to 797979, but standard message rates apply

Edit: Wow people keep saying you can go to the pharmacy which is funny because I have that written right above this since I posted this. 

But anyways, here’s why I’d choose poison control: there’s less of a chance you’ll be put on hold, they’re open 24/7 which many pharmacies are not, and if you live rurally or are in the wilderness for whatever reason (nature excursion, camping, skiing, hiking, etc) you have a toll free hotline for when you don’t have access to the internet
