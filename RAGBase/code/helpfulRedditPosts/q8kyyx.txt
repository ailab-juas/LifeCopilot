LPT: There will be times when you will find a wallet, a phone, a purse or something similar and you will have the chance to keep it for yourself without any consequences. Do the right thing, and try to get it back to its original owner.

I wrote this LPT because I'm kinda taken aback how dishonest people are. (Or at least the people who I work with)

Somehow the question came up "if you found a wallet would you keep it" and to my surprise everyone who was there said they would keep it, (4 people) or keep the cash and throw away the wallet with the cards/documents. One of them said he even did that before.

After this over the course of a couple of weeks I causally brought up this question to other people, just to see what they would do, and more people said they would keep the money than people who said they would give it back.

Have an honest personality, people, don't steal ffs
