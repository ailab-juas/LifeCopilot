LPT Your time, money, energy, and emotions are the most valuable natural currencies you have. Be wise and careful where you spend them, because eventually, they will all run out.

I was 17 when I had my first child, got married, had two more kids, and then got divorced by 23. 

Life got really hard, really fast, and I had to work twice as hard as my peers, doing jobs I hated while everyone else went on to get degrees and careers they enjoyed.

It took me a long time to figure out why I made such terrible decisions when I was young, but ultimately it comes to this:

I didn’t value myself. 
I didn’t value my time, my energy, or my emotions, and it set me back YEARS. 

My kids are approaching that age now, and more than any other lesson I want them to learn from me, I teach them this:
You are valuable. 
Your time, energy, money and emotions are valuable. Where you choose to spend them is up to you, but once they’re gone, they’re gone. Spend them wisely.

1) Thank you guys for the awards, and I’m really happy to see this message resonates! 
2) You’re right, money is not a “natural currency”. But it is a valuable and finite life resource. I only include it because it’s just as important as the other things in this list.
