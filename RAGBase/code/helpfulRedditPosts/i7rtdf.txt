LPT: If your friend on Reddit is feeling depressed, go to their profile, press the 3 dots on the top corner, and press “Get them help and support”.

content:
Reddit partnered with Crisis Text Line, which in return gives depressed people counseling for their depression, anxiety, or even mental breakdowns. Do not let your friend’s health deteriorate, they have feelings too.

Edit: Wow, gold! To whichever kind redditor did this, you are awesome, thank you!
