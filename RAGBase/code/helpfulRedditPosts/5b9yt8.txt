title:
Use + and . so you won't have to make new emails

content:
If you've ever needed to use a different email for some website but didn't want to make an entirely new email, you can use both pluses and periods. Anything you put after a plus will be disregarded, so emails sent to lifepro+tips@gmail.com will actually be sent to lifepro@gmail.com. They will *also* be tagged with whatever is after the plus, so you can easily find them in their respective folders. Similarly, you can insert a period anywhere in an email and it will be completely disregarded. lifepro@gmail.com = l.ifepro@gmail.com = l.if.e.p.r.o@gmail.com
