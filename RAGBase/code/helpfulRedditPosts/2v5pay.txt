LPT: Get Rejected

content:
If you have trouble talking to women (or guys I don't discriminate) the best thing you can do is get rejected. Get out there and get embarrassed. Be turned down. Make a fool of yourself. You soon realize that it's not so bad. You learn that being turned down isn't the end of the world. This realization makes approaching women much much easier. Soon you begin to figure out what does and doesn't work. Then they begin to say *yes* every once in a while. This makes your confidence grow. Confidence is like a cologne that women can smell. Higher confidence (not cockiness) leads to a more relaxed you making the woman feel at ease. When they're at ease its a piece of cake. But you have to start by getting rejected. At first it sucks but its a necessary hurdle.

EDIT: wording

EDIT: Hello from the front page!! wow this has been great. Im really glad this struck a chord with so many of you. Get out there and live life TRIAL BY FIRE style.

TRIPLE EDIT: WOW GUYS! This took off way more than I ever anticipated. I love hearing your stories and keep putting yourselves out there IT'S OK TO BE VULNERABLE. YOU AREN'T MADE OUT OF GLASS. Get out there and meet people! This planet has 6 BILLION people on it. Who cares if a few of them don't want to date you?? There are PLENTY who will. Im strangely proud of the people who messaged me with stories about how this thread inspired them to take that risk. Even though it didnt work out for some of you ALL of you told me about how you felt better having done it. TRIAL BY FIRE!!!
