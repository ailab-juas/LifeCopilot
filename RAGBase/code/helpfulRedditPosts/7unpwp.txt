LPT: Use a shaker bottle to mix pancake batter. You'll have less dishes to clean after, and pouring them onto a pan is easier!

Edit: I understand that over-mixing the batter makes the pancakes less fluffy. Just give it a few shakes instead.

Also, cleaning a shaker bottle takes 30 seconds. Fill it up with hot water, add a little soap, shake it like a salt shaker. 

I use Kodiak Cakes mix, for anyone who is wondering. I think it's amazing, and it's also great for fried oreos.
