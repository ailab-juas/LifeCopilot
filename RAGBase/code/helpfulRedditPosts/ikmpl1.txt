LPT Temporarily homeless? Join a gym, most gyms right now are hurting and prices have dropped.

content:
LPT I found out one of my students (college) was temporarily homeless and living in her car. She did have a part-time job and I convinced her to join the local gym ($15 per month) where she can not only work out but shower, use wifi, use a clean bathroom, and study while on the bikes. I also hooked her up with the college pantry as well as other pantries in the area. She graduated top of her class and to this day I still get letters of the utmost appreciation from her. Luckily her homelessness only lasted 3 months.

EDIT- Thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart for all the wonderful comments and awards. I also need to add that I didn't want to overstep my boundaries with the student-professor relationship so I bought the student a cart full of groceries, all non perishable, and toiletries. I had a friend of mine deliver it to her at the college. It was such a wonderful feeling to just help her get started.
