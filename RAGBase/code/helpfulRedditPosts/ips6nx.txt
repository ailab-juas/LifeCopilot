title:
YSK that the speaker at a drive through is always on when there’s a vehicle near it.

Edit: I messed up the title, the speaker is also a microphone. 

Why YSK

I’m posting this here because I told a story of my experiences working at a McDonald’s during high school, and lots of people didn’t realize the speaker/mic can hear everything you say as long as your car is even a little near it. 

The story was about what people say in their car before they are greeted, and if they’re stuck there in line after the order has been taken. 

This is important because if you’re the type of person to sing songs from frozen while waiting in line and don’t want like 10 people listening, or make rude comments about the staff, everyone in the store with a headset can still hear you.
