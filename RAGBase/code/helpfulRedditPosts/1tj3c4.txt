LPT: Never sell used electronics to people you know.

content:
either sell them on Ebay or put them up on cragislist or something. It doesn't matter if you get a better offer from someone you know, like a relative. If anything happens to the electronics, you will be blamed. They will insist that it was broken before. I always tell this to people and they rarely believe me. My friend sold his laptop to his Uncle 3 months ago. Today he had to fix it... 
This may not apply to everyone, but better safe than sorry
Edit: Also I used Electronics as a example is because they can break suddenly for no REASON. The ram in my laptop suddenly broke. Also My MicroSD card broke the other day for no reason while I was asleep. Shit happens. Its not your fault, but it will be made so.
