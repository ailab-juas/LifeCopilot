LPT: When you're cringing with humiliation at something you did years ago, stop and think of one of the people who saw it: can you think of something humiliating that happened to them? Probably not. Well, nobody remembers your moment, either.

When you remember that time you soaked a sweatshirt in perfume because you were lending it to a cute boy, fear not! Try and think of a humiliating moment that happened to one of the people watching you. You probably can't, because nobody remembers embarrassing moments that happen to OTHER people. **Nobody's thinking about your humiliation, just you.**

I have many such cringe-worthy moments in my past and when I start to curl up in shame, I remember that I'm probably the only one who ever thinks about it.

Edit: Wanted to leave this edit-free for a while. To address those saying "This is bullshit, I remember the shit they did" or "Look at this reddit post where people talk about stuff they remember," note that a) I said probably, and b) you really think all those people lie in bed at night thinking about your embarrassing moments? All right then.
