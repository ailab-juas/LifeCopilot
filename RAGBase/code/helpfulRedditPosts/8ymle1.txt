LPT : if someone you know just experienced something tragic like a really bad breakup or losing someone close. Be sure to be there for them at the 3week mark, this is typicaly where everyone else gets back to their normal life, and then suddenly feel really lonely

Edit: it seems like a lot of people are misunderstanding me, im not saying wait 3 weeks, im not saying it will be over anytime soon. And im not telling you to become their crutch (which may drag you down if you're not in the best place yourself)

Im letting you know, that after three weeks a lot of people with the best intentions slowly get back to their own lives, which may leave the hurt person lonely and in a bad place.
Just be aware, dont pummel them with questions, but make sure to ask once in a while, let then know you are there if they need you. Just be attentive and help where you can, be a friend. They'll need you more than ever.
