LPT: Have dandruff problems and dandruff shampoos are not helping? Try using a sulfate-free shampoo!

content:
I have suffered from dandruff and itchy scalp since I was young. My skin is not dry anywhere else on my body. I tried all popular brands of dandruff shampoos and conditioners including Neutrogena T-gel (tar shampoo) which was prescribed by a general physician. It helped only a little.

I read about sulfate allergies on reddit. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (aka Sodium lauryl sulfate) is a common foaming ingredient in shampoo and sometimes conditioner. Sulfate-free conditioners are very easy to find, and I switched to L'Oreal Sulfate-Free Everstrong shampoo at $6/bottle. Almost immediately, no more dandruff or itching!

EDIT: Another note, sodium dodecyl sulfate is also in many toothpastes. For a similar reason (drying or allergic reactiveness), it can cause canker sores in a person's mouth. If you have that trouble as I did, switch to a sulfate-free toothpaste as well. Sensodyne has some that are sulfate-free, but you must look at the ingredients.
