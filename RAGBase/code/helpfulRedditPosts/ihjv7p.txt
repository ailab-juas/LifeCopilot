LPT: Hold your breath to get rid of your stuffy nose!

content:
First: avoid this technique if you are pregnant or suffer a heart disease!

Second, here's the technique: breathe a normal breath in, then out, and pinch your nose while you hold your breath. While breath-holding, nod your head or start swaying side to side or walking. When a big air-hunger is created, stop moving and breathe in through your nose. You'll find your airways are clearing! Repeat five times for your nose to get completely unblocked. Continue breathing through your nose to avoid reversing back to that stuffy nose. 

I've known plenty of people who are unable to breathe through their nose because of a stuffy nose, be it because of allergies or deviated septums. If this is the case, I want to point out that you don't have to live that way. Mouth breathing is dangerous and leads to anxiety, bad rest, attention deficit and depression. Check out James Nestor, Steve Maxwell or Patrick McKeown for more free info. Breathe Right!

Edit: Glad to see people getting results. I'll add a few notes, since many people are asking.
Note 1: don't breathe through your mouth. Just keep it shut and relax into your nose breath.
Note 2: if your nose gets blocked again after a minute, find yourself a certified breathing coach because you might be a heavy breather. But don't sweat it, 50-70% of the population are according to the science, but learning proper breathing will probably fix most issues you are having. 
Note 3: if your problem is a deviated septum, search for Steve Maxwell and a technique called Rolfing. (I had misspelled the treatment). 
Note 4: if you repeat the technique many times, then do some long and powerful exhales afterwards to lower the acidity caused by the accumulated CO2. 

Cheers!
