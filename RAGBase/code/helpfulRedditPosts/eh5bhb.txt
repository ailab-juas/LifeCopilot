I was watching a movie last weekend and a girl in the front rows had a seizure. It was my first time after graduating in which I faced the “is there a doctor?!” situation. I was at the very top of the theatre so, before rushing there to help, I could see everyone was paralyzed watching her. Seizures, like a lot of other conditions, require a really basic assistance that can be done by potentially everyone. Those apps let you select the symptoms and guide you through the optimal intervention in a matter of seconds.
