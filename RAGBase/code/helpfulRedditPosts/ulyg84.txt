LPT: Learning to change established routines and habits is extremely valuable.

content:
They say that good habits are easier to make than bad ones are to break.  The truth is, we will always have to alter our old habits and routines to adapt to change.  If we become skillful at shifting into a new paradigm of thinking or way of performing tasks, we are at a great advantage in an ever changing world.

It boils down to embracing change, instead of resisting it.  Those that are comfortable in the unfamiliar have unlimited possibilities and potential.

Anyone that has learned a new language, particularly later in life, can attest to this idea.  When you learn a new language, you are not just learning a new set of words to express the same thoughts and emotions, you are learning about a whole new way to think and feel.  It's like unlocking a part of your brain that you never knew existed.

One of the hardest things to do is to change the way you do something, especially if you are very good at it and have been doing it for a long time.  It's not even always about getting better at the specific task at hand, but allowing yourself to learn a new way of doing something you familiar with.

The inspiration for this post was the example of typing on a QWERTY keyboard.  If one dares to try to learn a new keyboard layout, they will find it very (very) difficult.  Maybe they won't improve as a typist as a result, but the effort spent in changing how they perform a task so ingrained in the mind and muscle memory will be worth it.  It will exercise new parts of the brain and form new connections in brand new ways.  This is a paradigm shift, not just in the act of typing on a keyboard, but in the ways we think and learn.
