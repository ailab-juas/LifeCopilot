LPT Purchase a glass lid at a thrift store that will cover your regular dinner plate. Use it when microwaving your leftovers instead of plastic wrap.

content:
Most thrift stores have extra glass lids that have been donated. Lids from slow cookers work very well, as well as lids from circular casserole dishes. As long as they have no metal attached like a rim or handle. Use these instead of plastic wrap to cover your food when reheating. Better for you, better for the environment.
