YSK You are not tired because you slept too much

You are actually just dehydrated. 

While we sleep we lose a significant amount of water due to respiration and perspiration. We lose over twice the amount of water sleeping than we do resting awake. Which explains part of why we lose weight while we sleep. [Studies show](http://www.livestrong.com/article/402138-how-much-weight-do-you-lose-during-sleep/) some grown men lost 2lbs of water during an 8hour sleeping cycle due to water loss. Every time you exhale you release water vapor (hence why a mirror fogs when you exhale on it). 

So...when you sleep for a longer duration of time you lose even more water, resulting in dehydration, which causes tiredness. So all those years we were told we were groggy or tired because we merely slept too much, are false. We simply just need to hydrate.


**EDIT**

[Symptoms of dehydration:](http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/food/general-nutrition/1013.html)


* Little or no urine, or urine that is darker than usual
* Dry mouth
* Sleepiness or fatigue
* Extreme thirst
* Headache
* Confusion
* Feeling dizzy or lightheaded
* No tears when crying

So, conclusion being... respiration and perspiration contribute to some water loss while asleep, but also consider we are going 6-10 consecutive hours without any water. Water is a vital component to the human body (we are 2/3 water), so if we are not constantly replenishing our bodies it will effect how we function, and we will not be able to perform to our full potential. [Water IS our most important nutrient](http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/WaterUNM.html) after all. 


**EDIT 2** oh PS. Water is also the secret to hangovers. 

**TL;DR:** Water is fucking important. Be sure to stay hydrated because it will contribute to fatigue and how your entire body functions.
