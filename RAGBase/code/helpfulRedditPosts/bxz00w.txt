title:
YSK that Amazon can replace stolen items (at least smaller ones)

content:
Had some $40 bluetooth earphones stolen from inside my apartment building. The place is locked and it's a small building, but even then it wasn't safe. Thought for sure I would have to buy it again, but figured it was worth asking Amazon if they could do anything.

They refunded the whole thing and even waived off one-day shipping on my reorder just so I could get it ASAP. I know such a small order probably cost them pennies, but to me it was a big gesture that made me a lot less mad about the whole situation.
