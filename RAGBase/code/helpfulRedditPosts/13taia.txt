LPT:  Running late for work and you know its going to get you in trouble?  Stop and get donuts/bagels for the office!

content:
Overslept a bit?  Stuck and traffic and the boss never cares?  Go ahead and sacrifice an extra five minutes and pick up some donuts or if you can afford them, bagels.  The minute you walk into the office make sure everyone knows and quickly everyone, even the boss, forgets you came in late, and if they ask, you're late because you got the donuts.

**EDIT**  If you don't have the common sense of a normal human being on when and how to do this based upon your job, boss, feelings about co-workers, income levels, pride of work, etc., then do not try this.  In fact, don't try interacting with people at all, it might prove more challenging than you are ready for. 

Seriously.  Not every LPT works in all situations, have some sense....
