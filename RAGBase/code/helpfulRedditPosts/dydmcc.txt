YSK about SAAV, Sheltering Animals of Abuse Victims. If you and/or your family are fleeing domestic violence, there are many organizations that will take your pets and provide them free, confidential shelter and often medical care while you are seeking safety.

Also called SAAF, Sheltering Animals of Abused Families and a few various names.

YSK that if you are a victim of domestic abuse or violence, and a DV shelter cannot take in your pet, you might have a local organization specifically devoted to caring for your pet until you are ready to have them back with you.

According to SAAV Wisconsin, they aim to:

"Reduce barriers to safety for domestic abuse victims by providing safe refuge for animals when a victim leaves an abuser. Domestic abuse shelters typically cannot take animals into shelter and, when they can, it is only for a brief time. Research shows that up to 48% of domestic abuse victims delay leaving an abusive relationship because they have no safe shelter for their animals. Countless victims stay to protect their animals. SAAV reduces this barrier to safety by providing victims with temporary, safe, and confidential shelter for animals for up to 90 days while the victim transitions to safety. Shelter is provided primarily through foster homes."

And "Raise community awareness about the link between domestic violence, animal cruelty and other forms of family violence."

Edit: Thanks to everyone for great additional resources and suggestions! As u/UnicornofMeh pointed out, some domestic violence shelters encourage people to bring pets with them for the exact reason that people will delay leaving an abuser due to a pet, so please check with your local DV shelter.

I found out about these programs from visiting my local SPCA website. Please check your local SPCA, ASPCA, YWCA/YMCA or Humane Society website if you are interested in volunteering or finding out more information. There are too many individual local ones for me to list, but here are some broader resources.
