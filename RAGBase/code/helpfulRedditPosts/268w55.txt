LPT use your phone to clean your house :)

content:
For years it was almost next to impossible with work and school to keep my place clean and tidy. I would binge clean and it was a disaster the over the next days following. What did I do? I found the timer app on my phone and set it to 10 mins for each room.I feel like I must get as much done to beat the clock! (you would be amazed what can be acomplished in 10 mins!)I do this every other day and have a fairly tidy dwelling. No more feeling guilty or Embarrassed when unexpected company drops by. Don't need 10? make it 5.
