LPT: When you start a new desk job, create a spreadsheet on your first day and track what you do.

content:
I started a new job today, and everything I learn goes into an .xls for reference purposes, with as many tabs as are needed. When I left my last job earlier this week, I handed over the full .xls for the new person so they would have a "how to" readily available.
