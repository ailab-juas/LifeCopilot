LPT: Learn excel. It's one of the most under-appreciated tools within the office environment and rarely used to its full potential

content:
How to properly use "$" in a formula, the VLookup and HLookup functions, the dynamic tables, and Record Macro.

Learn them, breathe them, and if you're feeling daring and inventive, play around with VBA programming so that you learn how to make your own custom macros.

No need for expensive courses, just Google and tinkering around.

My whole career was turned on its head just because I could create macros and handle excel better than everyone else in the office.

If your job requires you to spend any amount of time on a computer, 99% of the time having an advanced level in excel will save you so much effort (and headaches).
