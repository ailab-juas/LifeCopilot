YSK: Most states have Safe-Heaven Laws allowing you to abandon your baby "no questions asked" at places such as Hospitals, Churches, and Firehouses.

content:
Nearly every state has a variation of said law with each stating what places are deemed permisable for "safe abandonment". Please dont abandon babies in parks or on the side of the road! These laws were created to prevent that very situation and give the baby the best possible chance to thrive considering the allready less than ideal circumstances.

EDIT "Safe Haven Laws" sorry for the typo.
