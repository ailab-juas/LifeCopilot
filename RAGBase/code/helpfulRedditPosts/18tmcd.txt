LPT: Tortillas are a good substitute for bread if you buy groceries for yourself. They don't expire as quickly and can just as nutritious.

I stopped buying bread altogether in college because it would always expire before I could get around to using half the loaf. This combined with lessened purchases of milk, fruit, etc. I was constantly trying to find replacements. I eventually came up with the idea of sandwich tacos (not super creative I suppose) but I was able to keep all the ingredients refrigerated for a month or so at a time. They go well with anything that you would normally put on a sandwich and the only issue is that they tend to be about half the size of a normal sandwich if you do it taco style.

Bachelor Stromboli: Sandwich meat (I use ham or anything that looks good in the deli), provolone and tortillas. Throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds per stromboli and bam you have a pretty decent meal.


Edit: For the nit pickers. This tip was for the younger crowd, not for the health fanatics. It shouldn't matter too much anyways considering there are healthy tortillas as well as the junk food ones that were mentioned in comments. Also tortillas don't have to be refrigerated in order to keep their long shelf life; it is preferred though. In my opinion they also thaw better than bread.

Edit2: For all the people saying you can put bread in the fridge, most people in college don't have full size fridges. Dedicating half the fridge to a loaf of bread is pretty unreasonable.
