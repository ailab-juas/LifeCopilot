title:
LPT: if you feel uncomfortable in social situations - memorize about 10 questions which most people would be happy to answer. If youre nervous rely on your basket of questions to get people taking about themselves.

content:
Questions you can ask: 
- what do you do for fun? What are your hobbies?
- where did you grow up? What was it like? 
- where was the last place you went on vacation? Who did you go with? Where would you like to go? 
- what do you parents do? 
- are you watching a tv series right now? What was your fav one in the last few years? 

Note how I didn’t list the question “what do you do for work”. If they want to talk about it they will. Many people don’t define themselves by their work. They define themselves by what they do outside of work. So inquire about those things. They will want to talk to you about them and will in turn be curious about you because you are asking interesting questions.
