LPT: if you're charged a cancellation fee, get comfortable with small claims court

content:
More companies are finding ways to tack on extra fees at every opportunity. Moving out fees. Cancellation fees. Threats to send you to a debt department. 

You can get it resolved by doing the following: 

* Asked for an itemized bill via email
* Asking to get it removed via email
* Consider getting small claims court involved. 

It costs companies MORE to send a representative.  They hope you don't notice and just pay. That's what they want. 

And if they move forward on your threat, small claim court is a shot to get this resolved in about an hour, especially if you document very well. 

Just like a parking ticket, it's always always worth it to just try.
