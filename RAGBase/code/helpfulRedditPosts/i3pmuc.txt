title:
YSK that "I'm sorry you feel that way" and "I'm sorry for making you feel that way" are entirely different

content:
"I'm sorry for *insert verb here(doing something that upset you etc.)* you feel that way" is an actual apology. "I'm sorry you feel that way" is not a proper apology even if the person saying it may think that it is an apology. It's not.

Edit: ok, I gotta know, whose been teaching these people that their actions and other people's actions can't change their feelings about a situation? Cause I've seen this argument from several users so far
