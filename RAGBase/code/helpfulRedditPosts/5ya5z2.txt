LPT: To catch your loose dog, run from it not towards it

content:
Story time:
Once a stranger's dog got it's collar off near a busy intersection. She was trying to chase it, and tried handing me her other dog's leash while she chased it. I started running away in the opposite direction making bizarre squeaky noises, and she looked seriously pissed off...until the (escaped) dog decided I was playing with him, chased me, and I easily nabbed him. 

My family used this trick whenever our golden got out. Generally speaking, dogs are fast and hard to chase down. Letting the dog decide where to go is an easy way for them (or you) to get hit.

Disclaimer: don't try this with other people's dogs if they might be aggressive.

TL;DR Let your dog catch you instead of you catching your dog
