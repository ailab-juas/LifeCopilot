title:
LPT: If you want children to behave in a specific way tell them what you want from them, instead of telling them what NOT to do

content:
Sentences with “don’t do x” are harder for small children to process and understand.

Telling them what you want from them works better.



EXAMPLE: try to avoid a sentence like “**Don't run**.”

but say "**Walk slow**" instead.
