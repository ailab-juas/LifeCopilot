LPT: How to Beat the Heat from Someone Who Lives in the Tropics

content:
1.  Wear lightweight clothes and as few as possible.  

2.  Get up early and do all your physical activity early morning.  Make sure you have made something for lunch if you need to cook.  Cook anything as early as possible in the day.

3.  In the hottest part of the day, use that time for "quiet" work or reading.

4.  Not long after you get up in the morning, close windows and pull curtains and close doors.  This will help keep the cool air from the night in your house longer.  This works even if you have AC.

5.  Cook outside.  If you don't have a bbq grill, just get a small cooktop or camping stove and use that.  

6.  Drink plenty of water throughout the day.

7.  If possible, take a couple of quick, cool showers during the day.

8.  For your yard -- be sure to do any watering in the evening.  Lets your plants get hydrated overnight.  Don't use a sprinkler.

9.  Insulate your curtains if you need to.  

10.  Use fans whether floor fans or ceiling fans, they help a lot.

Edit:  I think the underlying message to this needs to be:   Things are not going to be the same and people need to start thinking in creative ways to beat the heat.  Just using the AC more is not the total solution.  Imagine if there are brownouts or blackouts and you have NO AC.  

Also... thanks for all the replies.  Some additional good suggestions there.
