LPT: If you're learning a foreign language, watch toddler cartoons (e.g. Peppa Pig) in that language to help you improve!

content:
Each episode has simple topics which you can often learn to adapt and use for your own conversational exams and the dialect from the characters are better to understand. They also don't speak so fast compared to adult/age appropriate films/tv shows.

I've been watching French Peppa Pig!
