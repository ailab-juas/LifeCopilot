YSK that if you or anyone you know is being abused and they have been strangled in the past by their partner, that their risk of being murdered is increased as much as 1000%

**Strangulation is a clear, well-documented, well-researched indicator for homicide in cases of domestic violence.**

The CEO of HOPE International, the leading domestic violence and sexual assault prevention organization in the United States, stated that “**victims who had been strangled were** [750%](https://www.policyforum.net/red-flag-homicide/)**more likely than other victims to be killed.”** Other sources estimate it could be as high as [%1000](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/jr000250e.pdf).

**“Strangulation inhabits a category all its own in domestic violence as a marker of lethality. A kick, a punch, a slap, a bite — none of these, though terrible, portend homicide like strangulation does.” -** Washington Post, "Which domestic abusers will go on to commit murder? This one act offers a clue" by Rachel Louise Snyder

**“US studies show that in close to** [**50 per cent of deaths**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2573025/) **involving intimate partner violence, women had experienced non-fatal strangulation** [at least once](https://www.policyforum.net/red-flag-homicide/) **before they were killed.”**

If your partner has strangled you in the past, under any circumstances (such as when they are intoxicated or "provoked"), you currently have less of a chance of surviving your abuser than you do surviving of a [heart attack](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH-cOqhNvqAhUUIDQIHeqtB6kQFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fhealthbeat%2Fhow-heart-attacks-became-less-deadly&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XSctzJtNtW807D41dWGgY). Imagine the panic and immediate action and, most importantly, intervention that surrounds someone having a heart attack. **You deserve the same intervention to save your life.**

**You can lose consciousness after just** [10 seconds](https://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/strangulation-concerning-type-domestic-abuse/) **of being strangled, yet the damage is permanent.** You can lose consciousness and never stop breathing., and it can still cause brain damage. It can lead to memory loss. It can cause a [blot clot](https://www.thehotline.org/2016/03/15/the-dangers-of-strangulation/) that could kill you days or weeks after you were strangled by your partner.

Do not panic.
