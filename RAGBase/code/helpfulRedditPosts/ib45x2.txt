LPT: There are 34 different CLEP tests that equate to a college class of 3 credits at many universities for only $80

content:
College Level Examination Placement (CLEP) tests are accepted by most universities. This pandemic could be a great time to catch up in college credits or get ahead for cheap.

 You can teach yourself the course or use other resources. [Modern States](https://modernstates.org/) has courses offered specifically to teach CLEP material and if you finish the course they pay for the test. I got 9 college credits for FREE through modern states.
