LPT: If you need to cancel your cable and they ask why, just tell them you're moving in with someone who already has a subscription to their service.

I've done this twice. Once because that was actually the case. And a second time because it worked so well the first time. They were immediately like "Oh ok, no problem", and the whole process was over in a couple of minutes.

edit: Wow, a lot of people here clearly have never had to cancel their cable service. Half the comments are "You're a grown man, just say you don't want it anymore. You don't need an excuse." *Obviously* that's not the point. The point is to shut down the conversation as soon as possible with a legitimate ("legitimate") excuse. If you just say "no" or "I don't want it anymore", they're going to engage with you for as long as possible in trying to retain you as a customer in some capacity. It's literally their job to do exactly that. Keep you on the phone as long as they can. If you give them an excuse right at the top that they can't counter, the conversation is over and you aren't stuck in a 10 minute long loop repeating yourself over and over that you don't want their service anymore.
