LPT: if you're in college or plan on attending college, get as many credits as you can doing "credits by exam." This saved me an unbelievable amount of time and money with generals.

content:
Especially if you're waiting for an application approval or just bumming around all summer, some of these exams can get you 3-4 credits for $80. 

Some common ones:

CLEP

DANTES

ECE

DSST

Edit: Of course you should make sure your school accepts these credits (most schools do). 


Edit: the "college experience"  is not lost by doing exams.  If anything,  it enables the student to lighten his/her load and and/or take elective credits. I know that many students struggle with the expense and stress of their freshman and sophomore year,  and this is a potential solution for a vast number of students.
