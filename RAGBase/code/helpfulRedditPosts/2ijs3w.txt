LPT Pick one credit card. Keep it at home in a drawer or safe, and use it to pay all of your recurring bills and nothing else.

(This is a revision of a badly worded post I made last night}

1.You'll never have to worry about the card getting lost or stolen, and screwing up all of your bills that get auto paid with it.

2. If the card number does somehow get compromised, the monthly statement will give you a handy and complete list of companies you need to update your payment info with.

3. Because you don't use the card for anything else, you won't have to dig through a list of general, everyday purchases in order to find the recurring payments

4. If a card other than this one gets stolen you won't have to worry about whether or not you used that card to pay any bills.

5. If you don't have a complete list of your monthly bills written down somewhere (which you should), the monthly statement can function as that list.
