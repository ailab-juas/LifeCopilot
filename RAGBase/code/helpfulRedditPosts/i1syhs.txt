YSK there is a growing body of research that suggests the risk of dementia can be reduced by up to 40% simply through lifestyle choices.

Disclaimers up front: first, I am not a medical professional. Second, in researching this I learned “dementia” and “Alzheimer’s” are not synonymous. Alzheimer’s Disease is simply the most common form of dementia. There are other, less common forms, such as [vascular dementia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vascular-dementia/).

I was first introduced to this idea by seeing [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/30/lifestyle-changes-could-delay-or-prevent-40-of-dementia-cases-study?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) on worldnews. At first, I was skeptical. I’ve seen a lot of pop-science articles that are more “pop” and less “science.” But this article was about a study that was co-authored by a [very well-cited professor](https://www.google.com/search?q=gill+livingston) and building on an [existing body of research from 2017.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(17\)31756-7/fulltext) Which is what legitimate science tends to look like.

Ok, enough stalling, there are12 lifestyle factors that have been shown to increase the risk of dementia. So here they are, in decreasing order of impact:

* Hearing Loss – loss of hearing in middle age is linked to higher incidence of dementia and is the biggest risk factor of the 12. Wearing a hearing aid has been shown to effectively offset the dementia risk from hearing loss. 
* Lack of Education – reaching a higher education level before 45 is correlated with a reduced risk of dementia.
* Smoking – smokers have a higher rate of dementia. Stopping smoking, even with subjects over 60 years old, has been linked to a reduced likelihood of developing dementia.
* Depression – depression is linked to higher rates of dementia. It is currently still unknown whether treatment with antidepressants can effectively combat this, as studies don’t always make distinctions between treated and untreated individuals. (Edit: I know depression isn't fully under someone's control. Not all of these factors are.)
* Social Isolation – More social activity, especially later in life, has been shown to lower the risk of developing dementia.
* Traumatic Brain Injury – Concussions and other head trauma has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing dementia, especially if they happen later in life.
* Air Pollution – higher levels of certain air pollutants have been shown to increase dementia risk. Much of the pollution examined is generated by more traffic and automobile use, though another common producer is residential wood burning.
* Hypertension – chronically high blood pressure (aka hypertension) throughout one’s mid-life has been shown to increase dementia risk. Intensive treatment for hypertension has been shown to reduce this risk somewhat.
* Physical Inactivity – those who exercise weekly in their middle age report lower incidence of dementia, though the studies on this are complex. Exercise has been definitively correlated with reduced dementia risk, but how much it helps exactly and how long the benefits last are disputed.
* Diabetes – type 2 diabetes is a clear risk factor for dementia. Dietary control has not been shown to mitigate this risk, and it is unknown if any medications intended for diabetic treatment have any effect.
* Alcohol (&gt;21 units/week) – excessive alcohol consumption has long been known to increase the risk of dementia. However, there is also some evidence that light alcohol consumption (&lt;14 units per week) may also reduce the risk of dementia.
* Obesity – a BMI of 30 or above during one’s midlife has been shown to be correlated with increased incidence of dementia, though interestingly a BMI of “overweight” (between 25 and 30) does not show any correlation to dementia later in life.

All of these are taken directly from the [Lancet Commission’s 2020 report on dementia prevention, intervention, and care.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30367-6/fulltext)

Now, as with any new research, there is a caveat to all of this: nearly all of these factors are large-scale correlations, so we cannot be sure of any cause-and-effect relationship between them. A lot more research is needed to pin down what individual people can change at which points in their lives to help reduce their risk of dementia later in life. Still, this report shows some clear trends that might be worth considering when it comes to our own personal health, and especially to public policies on community health and welfare.
