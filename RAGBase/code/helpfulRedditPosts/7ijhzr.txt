YSK if your dog eats grapes and/or raisins, this can lead to kidney injury or even death for your pup.

If your dog has eaten grapes, raisins, or maybe even grape juice (just for safe measure) within 2 hours, induce vomiting. Otherwise take them to the vet where they will likely give your dog something to help him or her vomit. 

Edit: 1 grape per pound of body weight is dangerous. 2-3 rains per pound. Thanks mongograpefruit
