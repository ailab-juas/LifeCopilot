LPT: Don't put potato peels down your drain

content:
If you put potato peels down the sink, even in a garbage disposal, they will form a paste and clog the drain. Happened to me one thanksgiving and ruined my morning

Edit: I bet I saved at least one person from a clogged drain today. Which was 100% my goal.

Happy to see others who have gone through the same experience learned the hard way. We know we shouldn't put everything down the drain, but there are boundaries.
Also, compostables in the trash causes methane and problems at the garbage dumps. So you're not all right.

To all those who left your dog shit comments about how dumb I am, I appreciate it. You keep the internet alive and remind me why I seldom post my thoughts. Very helpful.

Happy holidays y'all!
