LPT: Befriend your mail carrier.

content:
My mail carrier's name is Andre. When it's hot outside I leave him bottles of water, and I leave him holiday cards, etc. 

Your mail carrier works for you *every day* and you should appreciate them! 

When I have packages coming he texts me. I only live a few blocks away from my office so if a signature is required I can run home and sign. If something is too big to fit in my box, he'll stash it somewhere inside the building and text me the location.
