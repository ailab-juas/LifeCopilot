LPT: If you really want to help those in Houston shelters, give them your old laptop. As long as it can get online, bank accounts can be checked, FEMA forms started, and social media updated. No one wants your old pants or underwear--give technology.

I worked sixteen hour days during Katrina. Fred Smith sent his personal IT guy to give us all their executives old laptops so we could get folks online and started. Visit a shelter with your laptop and help someone fill out a FEMA form at 11 at night--those sites will crash during the day. Clothes become a nuisance quickly. Donate old laptops or for God's sake NEW PACKAGES OF UNDERWEAR.
