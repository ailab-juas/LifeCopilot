LPT: Take your posture and back health seriously, you will pay for it if you don't.

content:
I was an avid sitter for many years, never thought much of it, wasn't horribly unhealthy but I sat way way too much and I knew that but I never did anything about it, now I have a pinched nerve and extremely debilitating sciatic pain because of my oversitting, take this as a sign and workout, stand, do whatever you can to reduce how much you sit, I didn't take it seriously and now daily life is hell and the recovery is extremely long, it's not worth it, find other ways to game, watch tv etc. In other positions, just reduce your sitting time however you can.

EDIT: Just wanted to clarify that I am seeing a physiotherapist for the issue to get it resolved, it will just take a long recovery, if you suffer from this same pain, or pain in muscles when the muscle itself isn't injured, see a doctor immediately if it persists, 1 doctor's visit is much better than once a week for 6 months down the line
