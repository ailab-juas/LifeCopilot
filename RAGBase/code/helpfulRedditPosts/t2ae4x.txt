LPT: If you want to up your cooking game, learn how to make basic sauces

content:
I do a LOT of cooking, and the one thing that always seems to impress friends is when I make sauces from scratch. Whether it be a gravy or pizza sauce or bechamel or even just deglazing a pan for a tasty pan sauce. Making your own sauces elevates food WAY past grocery store level, and almost all of them are super easy to make. Give it a try next time!
