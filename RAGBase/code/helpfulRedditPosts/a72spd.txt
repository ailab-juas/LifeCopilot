LPT wrap cheese in a cloth or paper towel before storing in any kind of plastic. The paper will absorb moisture from the cheese and it will keep for a lot longer.

I've kept cheeses like cheddar happy and tasty for a long time by regularly replacing the towel.

Remember kids, a taco saved is a taco earned.
