YSK: The length of your shoelaces needed is determined by number of eyelets (or holes) in your shoes

content:
Never knew this til now (and by ordering the wrong size shoelaces) so I figured I’d pass on the info! The number of holes or eyelets that your shoe has determines the proper length needed to properly lace your shoes. 

Here’s a guide:

4-5 pairs of eyelets (8-10 total holes)- 30”-36”

5-6 pairs of eyelets (10-12 total holes)-40”-45”

6-7 pairs of eyelets (12-14 total holes)- 54”

7-8 pairs of eyelets (14-16 total holes)-60”-63”

9+ -madlad status- 72”
