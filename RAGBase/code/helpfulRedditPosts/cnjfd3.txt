LPT: If you have lettuce that is wilted/soft, leave it in a sink full of water overnight. This is what Grocery stores do to make it crisp &amp; fresh!

Edit 2: USE A BOWL OR A BUCKET...

*** It’s important to add that we soaked overnight only when very wilted(think wet paper) 

Like those in the comments, it’s best practice to do a short soak in a bowl of *cold* water for an hour &amp; than place it in your crisper bin in the fridge.

Edit 1: This was in a produce-department ONLY sink, which was used purely for washing &amp;amp; prep of vegetables.
