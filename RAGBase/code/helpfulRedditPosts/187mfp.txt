LPT: Turn the subtitles on when your kids watch TV

content:
I turned the subtitles on when my oldest son started watching Sprout, Nick Jr. and Noggin and he is excellent with his verbal and spelling skills.  I have also done this with my youngest and he is on the same path.  Many kids shows repeat the same words and those words will also be seen by the child equally as much.  My sons do not have to sound words out to spell them they can just recall what it looked like.
