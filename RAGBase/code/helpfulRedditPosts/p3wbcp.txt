LPT: Being kind and doing the right thing do not lead to getting taken advantage of or getting treated like a doormat. Not knowing how to avoid toxic people or situations, or merely acting kind to get what you want out of people, is what leads to it.

There is a pervasive and, I think, pernicious belief that being kind and doing the right thing will lead to getting kicked around. I used to think this, I use to think that's why I was getting kicked around. I've met plenty of people who think this way.

But most of the genuinely kind and good people I know are not the ones who are failing in life, getting stepped on, etc. These are competent, confident people who don't do things for other people who they know are parasitic or toxic, they just never go there. 

Good people are actually magnets for other good people and they can pick and choose the quality of people they interact with. Once someone is shown to be a bad apple, they get bounced from the barrel immediately - and they can usually tell if the apple will go bad before they even get entangled.

Just because you know successful people who are assholes, that doesn't mean that is a necessary quality. It doesn't disqualify someone from success, unless you consider success being surrounded by good quality and trustworthy people.
