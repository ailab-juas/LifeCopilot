LPT: Guys if you're in in the drug store buy a 10 pack ($2) of those black hair rubber bands and keep them in your glove box. I've been the hero to countless women this way.

content:
I had an ex-girlfriend who was always losing those black scrunchy rubber band hair ties, so I bought her a 10 pack on the condition that I keep them in my truck. She went through a few,  but many times I'm with other girls and I see them fret about their hair when it's hot or windy,  or worse: "Can you take me to the store,  I need hair bands".   Oh hell no.  

"Uhh, actually I have some new ones in my truck". 

100 Points for this guy.
