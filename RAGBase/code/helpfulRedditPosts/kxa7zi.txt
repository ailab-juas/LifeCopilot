LPT: Confidence isn't "I believe I won't fail", but rather "... Even if I do fail, I will be fine".

content:
I often see people's confidence ripped away with respect to something once they fail at it, or if they get humbled for whatever reason.

Confidence is not outcome contingent - but rather, a type of stoic "knowing" that regardless of what happens to you (your fault or not) you will emerge from it perfectly fine. If anything, wiser.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold and the awards guys. I’m just glad that some of the things I’ve learned through my own challenges are able to strike a note with you.
