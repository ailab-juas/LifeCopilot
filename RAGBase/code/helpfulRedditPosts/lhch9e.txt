YSK that not all abuse is physical or visible.

content:
WHY YSK: Emotional and mental abuse leaves hidden scars that no one can see by looking at someone. They can be seen in certain actions or words. Constant apologizing is a big red flag as is fear of making a mistake or upsetting their partner. People who have been emotionally and/or mentally abused are harder to love, they have self doubt, they've been called and told they are awful things and have come to believe them, they have major walls and baggage, a normal argument can scare them, and they often are waiting for the other shoe to drop when they find a good relationship. You need to be more patient with this kind of person and don't push them to tell you what happened, they will tell you when they're ready.


Edit to add: WOW I can't believe this, I went to bed and this sub blew up. Thank you for all the awards I going through and thanking individually but in case I miss anyone, thank you. I posted this because I don't think it gets talked about much and for a lot of victims like myself we may not even realize it's happening to them. I found out through a work mental health assessment we had to take when I was 21, it said get help innthe results. I still didn't believe it so I looked up sign of emotional or mental abuse online and found a checklist of things and almost every box was ticked off. Shortly after that we got into another huge fight and I called my parents moved out that next morning. I had parents to lean on and I know not everyone does but the 1st step to getting help is realizing you need it whether yoi are currently in the situation or have trauma from the past.
