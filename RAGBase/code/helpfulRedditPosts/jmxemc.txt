YSK: If you drop out of WiFi or Data coverage, most cellphones will work overtime to find a connection. Leaving WiFi or Data on can be a big drain on your battery as your phone pushes more power through its internal antenna trying to connect to a network.

Why YSK:  

I used to work in an office that had no data or wifi signal. I started to notice after the first few months working there, that my phone would always be at 20 - 30% battery by the end of the day, where before I would always have between 60 &amp; 70% even while leaving my data on all day.

My co-workers said they had the same problem, and eventually we figured out it was our phones wasting battery trying to find a signal.
