LPT: If you're nervous about asking your boss/potential employer about raises/salary, don't think of them as authority figures you hope will be more generous, think of them as customers who are buying your time.

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to make it to the front page. 

From what I'm seeing in the comments, a lot of redditors have some pretty terrible employers. IMO, if your relationship with your employer is so adversarial that their response to you knowing what you're worth and asking to get paid as such, is for them to fire you out of spite, I wouldn't be hanging around at that job even if they did give me the raise I want.

Some employers are great and will happily give you what you're worth, a lot of employers are scumbags who who try to milk you for everything you're worth while paying you jack shit, but plenty of employers are simply businessmen trying to get the best value for their buck, but will pay a valuable employee what they're worth if it makes good business sense.
