title:
LPT: DON'T be on your best behaviour on a first date. DO be your normal, everyday, relaxed hanging-with-friends behaviour. You want the person to like you for who you actually are, not who you are pretending to be. You will save yourself a lot of wasted time dating people who only like the fake you.
