title:
YSK when installing applications to your PC you should ALWAYS select "Advanced" or "Custom" installation

content:
Many times programs will install add-ons or unnecessary plugins without permission through the "full" or "typical" installation (note that these installations usually say "recommended" and that's how they get you.)

Edit: Because there have been so many people saying it - you must keep in mind that there are SOME advanced softwares that you should not use custom installations for unless you know what you don't need. 

Generally, the unnecessary add-ons are pretty easy to spot, but if anything do a little googling while installing if you're unsure.
