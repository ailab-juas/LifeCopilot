LPT: If you take someone to a gun range who has never shot before, stand no more than a foot behind them

content:
This way they physically cannot turn around and accidentally point a loaded gun at you. Chances are they will try turn around to ask you a question if you're teaching them, and many times they don't think about the gun in their hands. Plus you can better see what they're doing and coach them appropriately. 

This is also true for archery. There have been several occasions in which someone has tried turning towards me with the string pulled back, which is a situation many times more dangerous than a gun

Edit: with all the traction this post is gaining, I should add that this is not a substitute for teaching basic gun safety, but it ensures that you, the acting instructor, remain safe if the shooter has a lapse in focus which is more common than you'd think
