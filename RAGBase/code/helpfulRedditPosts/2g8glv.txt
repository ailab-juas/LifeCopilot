LPT: When taking a taxi, always get a receipt. If you later realize you left something in the cab, the receipt contains valuable information that may be able to help you recover it.

In NYC at least (that's where my experience happened), the receipt I was given included the medallion number, a number that helped locate the driver, the date, the time I got in and the time I got out. All this information was invaluable to locating an item I had lost. Without the receipt, I would have never recovered it. Your only recourse becomes trying to deal with a very convoluted lost and found system. Learn from my absentmindedness!
