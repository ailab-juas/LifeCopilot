YSK: If you desperately fear/avoid "harmless" things like asking people out, interviews, social situations, what people think about you, or just life in general, you may have uncontrolled and debilitating anxiety. Just as I did, please consider getting help, if only through prescribed medication.

tl;dr: (EDIT: Talk to you doctor about getting the help that's right for you, REGARDLESS of what that help is!! By "if only through prescribed medication", I mean "even if it is only through prescribed medication". Definitely not saying that's the only way!!)

&gt;**See your doctor if:**

&gt;**You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life**

&gt;**Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control**

&gt;You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety

&gt;You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem

&gt;You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors â€” if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately

&gt;-----

&gt;Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.

Why YSK: Your life could change for the better DRASTICALLY, as mine has. Imagine being chained down from doing anything other than what you already know to be as safe as possible day after day, and *even having that be difficult because of "what if?"*. Having to pull with all your might to attempt anything remotely new and scary, even if there's no logical reason why. It's no way to live.

Don't get me wrong--fear is important! It keeps us from immediately YOLOing ourselves into non-existence. "I want to feel like I'm flying!" *finds the nearest, highest place to jump off of and flap my arms uselessly*

But just like with all good things, fear's level can be set WAY too high. It's like a shell that's so thick and all-encompassing you can't feel or be close to anything or anyone, or being so engorged with life-giving water that you get sick or die.

If you feel your level of natural fear is just too high, reaching a point of uncontrolled and debilitating anxiety, please consider investigating if it truly is by talking to a doctor. There are treatment options, and they are *worth it* and they can **work.**

And most importantly of all: **A debilitatingly high level of anxiety is NOT YOUR FAULT.** YOU are NOT BROKEN or UNDESERVING. You **HAVE** broken arms, and you're trying to drive "just like those" whose arms aren't broken. Get your arms fixed first--you deserve it!!

On a personal note, for me, the endless cycle of self-improvey suggestions like "be yourself" and "just act confident" and "nothing she can say will hurt you" were NOT helpful. The only way I found relief, TRUE relief, was through medication. That's *my* story, though--and others many find help through other means. Your doctor will be able to help you find out which way works best! And dump any doctor who doesn't take you seriously--about this or anything else, especially pain. But that's just my personal opinion, too.

Some things I look back on that show how anxious I used to be literally all of my life:

-At Disneyland or a theme park as a child, I'd be much more focused on how our family would meet back up if anything went wrong than I would about having fun.

-I've never asked anyone out on a date IRL for fear of the "ew" brand of rejection. Thank God for online dating before I figured out the whole anxiety thing.

-Every negative comment I'd receive, especially IRL, would send me spiraling, worrying that I wasn't good enough or I was broken or wrong somehow, undeserving of love. "Why am I like this? Why is it *JUST ME?*" Likewise, every positive comment would be immediately and negatively explained away. "Oh they just don't know the true me enough."

-"I don't know what to do with my hands in social situations" hit me on a *spiritual level*.

-I "went with the flow" as if life was a video game. What life presented to me, I treated as what I should deal with. I almost never went out of my way searching for what *I* wanted, for fear of wanting the wrong things and regretting it. I even believed that I wouldn't "find my true love" if I didn't do the right things in life.

(Finally, and this is a(nother) personal opinion, but it's quite possible that a LOT of the fear-based problems we have as a society today stem directly from people with uncontrolled anxiety. Especially those in power, or those influenced by them. Then again, that could be my monkey brain trying to do pattern-recognition on something where there's no pattern.

...but I feel like a lot of the fear-mongering of the "other" would be severely reduced if so many people people were brought down from being on a more fearful level literally all the time.)
