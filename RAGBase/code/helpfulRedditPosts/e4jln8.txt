YSK If you live in the USA and your child needs services, you can get them even if their school won't tell you

I've been seeing how hard it is for parents to get information on what kinds of resources are available to them and their children. I'm in California, so some of this info might be specific to here, but look to see if your state or country has something similar. 

First of all, IDEA is a law that was passed to protect people with disabilities. Basically, your public school is required to pay for any services your child needs to do well in school. If they need a service that your school doesn't provide, they need to pay for you to access it somewhere else. You can get more info here: https://sites.ed.gov/idea/

Second, if your child is not in school yet and you have concerns, you can get them evaluated for early intervention. This link has more info and has links to find info for your state: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/parents/states.html

There are also other community-based services that are often free, or at a low cost. In California, we have Regional Centers, which provide services and events for people with developmental disabilities of all ages. Here's a link to their locations, but there's plenty of other info as well: https://www.dds.ca.gov/rc/rclist.cfm

If you feel like your child needs services and your pediatrician or school isn't giving you answers, try one of these avenues. There *IS* help out there, and often at a low or no cost to you. Take advantage. Advocate for your child. Spread information for others.

EDIT: I thought it was clear with the "if your child needs services" bit, but this only applies if your child has a disability that requires services, or you think they have one and need to get them evaluated.

EDIT 2: Thanks for the silver!!

EDIT 3: And gold?! Thank you! I'm really glad this is useful information, and I hope it reaches as many people as possible.
