LPT: Pain demands to be felt. Stop trying to ignore your emotional pain and let it have it’s time in the spotlight. Notice it, embrace it, and when you’re ready, let it go.

QUESTION: But how do I let go of pain?

It helps to imagine you’re embracing the person you were when that pain happened. For example, I used to get abused when I was a child. So whenever my feelings of pain and loneliness came about, I would sit down on the floor, imagining small Steve crying, and I would hold myself and ask myself what was wrong. Then eventually “we” would talk through it and small Steve would feel better. 

Eventually, small Steve grew up emotionally. No longer 5 years old, he became 10. Then 15. Then 20. and eventually our ages caught up with each other and then pain from abuse became a thing of the past. A distant memory.

The trick is to not identify with this pain. You are NOT the pain. The pain is a reaction to a small part inside of you that needs attention, so give it that :)
