title:
LPT: If your fire alarm goes off, call your pets and give them a treat. Eventually they will come when the alarm goes off, saving you from wasting time looking for pets during an evacuation.

content:
Added tip: Deliberately set off the alarm to do more frequent training.

Edit: alarm 'goes off' = alarm sets off = alarm starts. Apologies for use of confusing language.  Not sure yet how to edit title, I'm a bit of a newbie.
