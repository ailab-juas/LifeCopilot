YSK: Many fire departments will give you smoke detectors for free.

content:
As fire departments have a vested interest in keeping fires down, many municipal fire departments have free smoke detectors that they will provide you and give instructions on how to install. If you live in a home that doesn't have one or has too few, call your local fire department's nonemergency number and ask!
