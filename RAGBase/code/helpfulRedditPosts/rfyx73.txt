LPT: Use the alphabet to distract your mind

content:
Whether you’re trying to fall asleep and can’t stop thinking about stuff you have to do or if you’re having an anxiety attack and starting to spiral, try this alphabet trick to distract your mind:

Go through the alphabet and, for each letter, come up with three words that start with that letter.
A - alligator, animosity, altruistic
B - bumblebee, breakfast, basketball
(…and so on; you know how the alphabet works)

This gives your brain a linear, simple task and can prevent it from wandering. 

If you do this regularly, you can keep it fresh with topics (animals, places, things in a grocery store) or challenge yourself by requiring words of at least three syllables. 

I’ve done this for years to help me fall asleep when I’m anxious about something I need to do the next day.
