LPT: Many wildlife parents leave their children for hours at a time during the day. Do not assume babies left alone have been abandoned. If you are not sure, call a wildlife center before kidnapping babies.

content:
 I volunteer at a wildlife center and we get baby fawns, baby raccoons and other baby animals brought into us because people assume the parent is dead or abandoned them. These people basically kidnapped them and sometimes these babies end up getting euthanized because if they cannot be rejoined with their parents, some species will die so the kindest thing to do is to put them down.

You should leave them be and not disturb or even try to touch them. If it concerns you or you think too much time has passed, call a professional to check. If they need taken in, they can handle it or instruct you on how to handle it.
