title:
LPT: When at the beach, always beware the area where the waves don't crash. It often signals a rip current.

&gt; Edit : Since this is getting some visibility, I want everyone to know that this post doesn't explain all the dangers of rip currents, nor does it depict how they exactly appear all the time. i just wanted to share a side of the danger that may be interesting to be careful about. The most important thing to keep in mind is to **not try to fight back against the current**, **swim sidewides to break out of it**. Rip currents are not always like the areas mentionned in the title. Also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the subject, please read about it on specialised websites.

People often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. However the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

It is way easier to see with [an image](http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). If you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

A friend of mine died getting caught in a rip current last Saturday. Awareness literally saves life.
