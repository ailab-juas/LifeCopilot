* u/k-del and u/azureice recommend a plugin called [Disable HTML5 Autoplay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-html5-autoplay/efdhoaajjjgckpbkoglidkeendpkolai) for some videos this LPT doesn't cover
* u/happycj has [instructions for Mac Chrome users](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/57auji/lpt_annoyed_by_video_content_that_plays/d8qzpm2)
* u/MizarsAsterism and others like the NoScript Firefox extension to select which sites are allowed to run scripts
