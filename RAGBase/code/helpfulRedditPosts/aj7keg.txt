YSK regardless of your income level, 35 out of the 43 US states that require state tax returns also allow for free e-Filing, so don't let someone charge you for it (e.g., TurboTax wants $39.99).

Check your state's laws. Many people also qualify to file their federal _and_ state returns simultaneously thereby potentially streamlining the process even more.
