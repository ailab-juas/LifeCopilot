title:
LPT : When interacting with non verbal or severely disabled people and their carers, acknowledge the disabled person first.

content:
A simple wave, smile and hello (even though they are not going to physically or verbally respond much/at all) is invaluable to their self esteem, feeling of individualism and confidence. They are too often ignored completely or unapologetically stared at without a word. Prevent talking frankly about them with their carers in front of them like they aren’t there or they don’t understand, they do. They are part of the conversation too. 
This tiny thing will change the entire world for that one person, who has already been dealt with too much in this life.
