LPT: How to best effectively influence your Representative

content:
I used to work in DC on Capitol Hill answering constituent correspondence. I've seen what works and what doesn't when it comes to influencing and making your voices heard. Follow these rules and you will have an outsized voice.

Here are some insights

* Representatives most likely will **not** read your letter. They represent too many people and their offices are bombarded every single day by concerned voters. What they do instead is **rely on their legislative staff to filter and** **prioritize issues that matter.**
* You are not influencing the representative, you are **influencing their staff**
* This is the most **effective** method. **Write a handwritten letter.** It **will** get read. Handwritten letters are prioritized as it shows that constituents are concerned enough to put in significant effort. This implies to staff that many other voters feel the same way.
* Address the letter to the representative **and** staff
* Keep the letter short, polite, and most of all **actionable**
   * Specifically, ask the representative to vote or consider a certain bill
* Phone calls are the second most effective
   * Keep it short and be respectful. You will most likely **talk with an unpaid intern**
   * These interns will **not** write down your concerns. What they will do is **tally** the total number of calls and what voters want the representative to do
* Emails are the **least** effective. The staff gets a ton of emails a day and it is difficult to filter who is an actual constituent vs a non-constituent. Or worse, a bot. You will get a canned response.

**Some simple rules**

&amp;#x200B;

**Do:**

* Do include your address. It proves to the staff that you are an actual constituent
* Do organize a letter-writing campaign. **This is the most influential method of influencing.** It's what professional organizations do. They organize voters
* Do organize a call-in campaign but have **constituents** call at the **same time**. Nothing gets the office more lively than a full day of phone calls
   * Only do this when there is not a major vote going on. You do not want to compete with other phone calls
   * Do not have non-constituents call the offices. The staff is trained to ask callers what their zip codes are. This is to filter our non-constituents. It also significantly hurts the campaign as it will be seen as influenced by outside forces rather than by actual concerned voters
* Do reach out to all your representatives including local, state, and national representatives. The more local the better.
   * Local offices receive fewer letters

&amp;#x200B;

**Don'ts:**

* Don't threaten to vote against the representative or organize an effort to vote them out. Threats don't work. You are just one person
* Don't call or write to offices that do not represent you. They will not care. You already have a representative, talk to them
* Don't fall into the trap of believing that money will automatically win. **Voters will always take priority**
* Don't yell at the unpaid intern who takes your call
* Don't unexpectedly show up to their office. Make an appointment. Even better, organize a group of voters and make an appointment all together.

TLDR: Write a hand-written letter. Organize a letter-writing campaign. Don't threaten staff. Write in often. Make your voices heard
