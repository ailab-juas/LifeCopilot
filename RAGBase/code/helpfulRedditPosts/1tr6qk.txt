YSK that m.imgur.com links don't load on most mobile devices. Use i.imgur.com instead.

content:
Most mobile devices give a 404 error for m.imgur.com links. i.imgur.com links don't have this problem.

**See this photo for reference:**

**Now try to load the same photo as an m.imgur.com link:**

**EDIT: Apparently some people from imgur saw this post and fixed the bug. That's why they both are working for everyone now. They both work for me now, too. Thanks, imgur!**
