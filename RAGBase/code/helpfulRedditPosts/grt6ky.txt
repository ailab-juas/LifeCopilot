LPT: If a retail associate is friendly or helpful, tell their manager. It’s a simple way to give them, and the store a boost.

content:
It often takes a special kind of person to work in retail, they enjoy helping others, and it’s not always great pay. So if somebody goes out of their way to help you, go to customer service or call into the store and let them know who helped you, and that they did a great job. It’ll help make everybody feel good and might give that employee a much needed boost of praise or pay. 

I take note of people’s names and call in from the parking lot as I’m leaving. It feels good for everybody, even myself.
