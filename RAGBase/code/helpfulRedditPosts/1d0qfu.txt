Gaming LPT: When your PS3 controller isn't charged, don't sit on the floor because the USB cable is too short. Plug the controller into a laptop/netbook that's closer to comfortable seating so you can charge the controller without being tethered to the PS3.

Or, you can keep making your friends sit on the floor, since nobody will ever question that the controller must have to be plugged into the PS3 to charge.
