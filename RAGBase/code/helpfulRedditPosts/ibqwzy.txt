YSK When they ask for objections at a wedding, it’s to make sure they don’t have secret marriages or the couple aren’t related. It’s not a ‘last call’ for heartsick exes.

If you’re waiting for the objection scene, you already missed the boat, and you’re about to ruin someone’s wedding.

Edit: it’s obviously not at every wedding. It’s definitely on the books in the Church of England and Roman Catholicism, though some parishes allow it to be omitted. I’ve personally been to 3 weddings where it was said, though the misconception stands even if it isn’t actually said.
