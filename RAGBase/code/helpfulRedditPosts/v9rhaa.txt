LPT: when you realize you’re wrong, switch to the right belief as fast as possible. The human brain will forget you were wrong and the painful feeling of being wrong will be much shorter.

content:
The human brain doesn’t like being wrong. In fact, it actively tries to avoid it as much as possible because it hurts. In studies, 70-80% of people when presented with evidence that they were wrong, decided to double-down! 

We do this to avoid pain, but the reality is that it only prolongs it. Instead, if you find yourself arguing a point with someone, step back and honestly ask yourself if you’re wrong. This is a skill, so it can take some time to start doing reliably. If you find you’re wrong, admit it. The faster you switch from wrong to right, the faster the pain goes away. And your brain will “forget” you were ever wrong. 

Besides getting through the pain of being wrong faster, this will make you wiser (challenging and removing bad beliefs) and will often lead to people respecting you more.
