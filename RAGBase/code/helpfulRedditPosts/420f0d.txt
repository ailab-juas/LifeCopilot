YSK A really fast way to see accurate snowfall predictions is to check your local NOAA website

content:
With the impending northeast storm, there's a lot of sites pushing out snowfall predictions. News channels know that's what you want to see, which is why they bury it behind long videos inside crappy sites.

So go to where they get their info - and where pilots and captains have for 40 years - the NOAA. For example, here are 4 sites for major northeast cities. No ads, no videos, just forecast and snowfall predictions. I just find the core JPEG and bookmark it, and refresh it to see the updated totals.
