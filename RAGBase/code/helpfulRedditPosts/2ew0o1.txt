LPT: Look for jobs when you don't need one

content:
Not counting a fast food gig in high school, or the Army, I've had three job hunting experiences in my life.  The two that were at my own discretion (I already had stable full time employment that I was comfortable with) were amazing confidence boosters.  When you can walk into an interview where absolute rejection really isn't that big of a deal and you've got zero pressure, you're more confident and can be more honest.  Instead of putting out a dozen resumes and interviewing for random ass positions that kinda sorta sound like something you could do, you put out highly targeted resumes for positions you're actually interested in.  Worst case scenario, you burned a little time, got some more experience in an interview and will be better prepared for the next one.  I just landed a 30% pay increase, full benefits (previously very light benefits), and a 40 hour work week (down from about 55 or 60) doing this.  

Just don't be a douche bag and use your current employers time/resources in your  job hunt.  Likewise, make sure you clearly communicate to people that you're currently employed and need them not to call your current boss as a reference :)
