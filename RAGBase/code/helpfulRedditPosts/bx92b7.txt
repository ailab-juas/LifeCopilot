YSK: You don't need a 4k screen to appreciate 4k content

content:
When watching online videos in 1080p on a 1080p panel, not every pixel from the original file is perfectly translated 1:1 to the pixels on your screen, there is some unprecision, some margin which leads to some bluriness.

*(unlike in video games, where each frame is generated by your gpu so each pixel is "perfectly filled", nothing is located in between two pixels).*

This means that if you set the video quality to a resolution higher than your monitor's, you'll be using a file containing more information to fill in that "margin", the extra pixels from the file will be used to more precisely place each bit of information onto each individual pixel.

**It'll still be 1080p, but a much crisper 1080p,** ***actual*** **1080p.**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** Watching 4k content on a 1080p screen renders sharp 1080p. Wathing in 1080p delivers a 720p+ experience.

(**EDIT**: This was just my very groundless understanding of how this phenomenon I noticed worked. None of this had been fact checked. After reading some comments from people who obviously know a lot more than me on the matter I realize half of what I said doesn't hold up. Shouldn't have spread misinformation presented as facts, that's on me.  This original post is just my "Explain like I'm 5" take on it, which doesn't really save it from being a sub-par explanation. Apparently it has more to do with downscaling, bitrates.. just see the comments below for some *actual* information on why and how this occurs.)
