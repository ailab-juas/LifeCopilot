LPT: Use a shower cap as a bike seat cover.

content:
You can get a nice for $5 on Amazon, does a very good job and is much cheaper than a "waterproof" seat cover!

Edit: I am aware of the existence of grocery bags. These are frail and tear easily, while a shower cap is more durable and has an elastic band that makes it a lot easier. It also looks a shit ton nicer.
