LPT: To get people to listen to you, stop talking.

content:
I am currently dealing with a loss of voice due to extremely sore throat. My communication has been, for the past 2 days, primarily texting my family or whispering. 

I noticed that people have "tuned in" more when I've mustered up the energy to either whisper, or text.  One of my chief complaints was that people don't seem to listen to me (in order to obtain what I want to say), but take away the frequency, and suddenly, people are interested. 

Also, for my own "personal growth" aspect, it's helped me to learn to think about whether what I want to say is really worth it, and has taught me an important life lesson.
