content:
1. Upper right of any reddit page, click "**preferences**", 
1. Scroll down to "**link options**".
1. Check "**don't show links after I've liked them**", and/or
1. Check "**don't show links after I've disliked them**"

Now all you have to do is to vote. Threads  you upvoted or downvoted (depending on what you checked in step 3 and 4 above) will not show up on your front page anymore.

Reddit is fueled by user submitted content, *and* your votes. With this simple change, you make it work for yourself, and for everybody else.
