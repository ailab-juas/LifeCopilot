YSK: 25% of parents throw away stuff after their child leaves home, 1 in 12 in the first week

content:
Why YSK: As a parent YSK because your young adult is likely to have formed a great sentimental attachment to their possessions. They may also have a value you don't realize, e.g. comic books becoming collectors items. It's also hard for a young person to take stuff with them without a car. Ask before junking possessions.

As a child: It's important to communicate with your parents what needs keeping and perhaps giving or throwing away what you no longer need. If you have an unreasonable parent consider posting things to your new address or arranging to return quickly to collect your belongings.
