YSK that you can make your time more efficient studying by using Quizlet.com so you don't have to cut/write out hundreds of flashcards.

I generally use flashcards for revising, as well as making crib sheets to summarize the work. However, writing out and cutting out hundreds of cards can be quite hard when you're revising topics that are quite extensive to say the least. As such, Quizlet has a place where you can type in flash cards or copy someone elses. I generally prefer typing my own and revising from them since you're ''learning'' the material while typing in the flashcards.. There's also an app for iOS but I don't really use that except for when I'm on the bus or w/e.

Much more time efficient I believe.

Edit: Mind you, you don't need to only use it for ''Word/Answer'' you can make whole lists of things on on side and a simple question on the other. Since you're making so many flash cards, it's not a big deal to actually memorize everything.
