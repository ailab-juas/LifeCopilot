LPT: Dogs become more attached, as they age. Never Leave Your Pet During Euthanasia as they will search for you when you leave them behind.

content:
They will not understand why you left them when they are sick, scared, old, or dying from illness. In their most vulnerable time, stay with them and comfort them to help them transition. After all, they were there for you their entire life. Why can't you be there for them in the end. They are family.
