LPT - If a the seller of a used automobile won't let you test drive the car without paying cash for it first than it's a scam and you should walk away...

content:
This happened to me today. I am trying to buy a used minivan, I am no stranger to buying or selling used cars. I have had friends get burned by shady "auto brokers" or flippers. Not everyone is out to get you of course but be wary. The person I met today to view a used car showed 3 mild red flags:

\- Claims it was a family vehicle but car is clean, no wear inside at all.

\- Engine bay is detailed, rubber and plastic are shiny clean - this hides leaks/oil spots. While this might not always be the case it can be.

\- Shows up in a car alone with a mask on and doesn't take it off the entire time (this was to hide his identity. I am not anti-mask, I am pro-mask in public spaces).

And the final big red flag: Is very friendly up until you ask for a test drive, then the tone changes... they insisted that I pay 8K cash upfront before driving, I inconvenienced them and they had to leave work early and lost income to meet... his boss is upset, car is perfect no problems, doesn't want to let me test drive because "bad experiences" in the past...

I walked away, and you should to. Be careful out there ya'll.
