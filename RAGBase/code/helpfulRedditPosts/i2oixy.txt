YSK: If your car has those extra-bright headlights, you are blinding the small/low riding car in front of you at night.

content:
Even if they flip their rear view mirror to reduce the brightness, the side view mirrors shine your ultra bright lights directly into their eyes.

Keep an extra amount of distance between you and them to help keep the other drivers safe.

Edit 2: as countless people have pointed out, YSAK: you can adjust the angle of your headlights so you’re not as blinding to the car in front of you!

Edit: glad to see I’m not the only one hating these lights! Thanks for tips, I do a lot of driving at night on one lane highways, so next time I’m definitely going to adjust my side mirrors to shine the light right back in their face
