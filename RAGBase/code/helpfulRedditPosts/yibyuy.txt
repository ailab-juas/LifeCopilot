LPT: If you have a serious laceration or open wound and need to go to the ER, take a photo of it with your phone before you put on a bandage. It will make triage quicker and more accurate.

Emergency departments will triage based on urgency. I fell on a granite curb and tore open my knee, exposing the kneecap. I had to bandage it before going to the ER, so I took a photo of it in its gory glory before applying the gauze. When registering and they ask why you're there, show them the photo. Do the same thing for the triage nurse. 

* additional tip- for the sake of courtesy, let the registration staff know you can show them the photo, don't just whip it out and shove it at them.
