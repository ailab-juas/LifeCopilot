LPT: If you make a mistake at work be honest and come with a solution quickly. The boss will love your honesty, trying to hide the mistake makes you un-trustworthy.

A better word then boss would be leader

For all those who feel the need to lie because whoever is your leader will respond poorly, Iâ€™m sorry that you are dealing with that. A good leader is life changing. 
This LPT is for those who have a good leader that wants them to grow.
