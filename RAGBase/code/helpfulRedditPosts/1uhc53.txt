LPT: When moving, check your future neighborhood's Walk Score to see how many groceries stores, bars, and parks are within 10-15 minute walk from your address.

content:
I found this [website](http://www.walkscore.com/) from [this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_the_walkable_city.html) last night. He recommended this because a more walkable neighborhood has significantly lower obesity rates, carbon emission, and a higher overall happiness from people living in that neighborhood. By walking 15 minutes to the grocery store, you'll exercise, save time by skipping the car, and can enjoy any local businesses you see along the way, such as book stores or coffee shops.
