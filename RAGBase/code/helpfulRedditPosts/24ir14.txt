LPT: Being questioned by the police? Don't talk to them! (Fantastic lecture inside)

content:
Geto Boys put it quite elegantly

&gt; We don't talk to the police. We don't trust in the judicial system we shoot guns.

I'm sure a lot of people have seen [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc) lecture, held by an attorney and a police officer before. Watch it again! For those of you who haven't, set aside 50 minutes and watch/listen to it, it could save your ass one day!
