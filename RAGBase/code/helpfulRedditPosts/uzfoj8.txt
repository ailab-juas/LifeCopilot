LPT: To Get Better Sleep, Create a Restful Environment and Limit What you Do in Bed to Just Sleeping!

content:
I have struggled with sleeping my entire life. I figured out if I stuck to a routine and got a healthy habit with sleeping was how I could actually wake up rested. I know this won't for everyone but getting a routine made a massive difference for me. And yes sleeping and sex. Can't edit title.

And also - focus on making your bed comfortable!
