title:
YSK that anxiety/panic attacks don't always involve feelings of panic or anxiety

content:
If you ask a random person to describe a panic attack they'll probably paint a picture of someone completely freaking out and probably hyperventilating into a paper bag. But if you actually have a panic attack you might not even feel anxious at all. You could be sitting at your desk feeling completely fine and then the next moment feel like you're going to pass out for no reason. 

Here's what a panic attack might actually entail: 

* Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate
* Sweating
* Trembling or shaking
* Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering
* Chest pain or discomfort
* Nausea or abdominal distress
* Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint
* Chills or heat sensations
* Numbness and tingling
* Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)
* Fear of losing control or “going crazy”
* Fear of dying

Panic attacks and asthma attacks can actually feel very similar (shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness), but if you take your rescue (albuterol) inhaler and it makes you feel worse it's possible your symptoms are from anxiety rather than asthma.

EDIT: If these symptoms sound familiar to you, please bring them up with a doctor. Anxiety attacks are one of the most treatable mental health disorders, whether through meds, therapy or both. These symptoms can also be indicative of physical health problems - all the more reason to see a doctor!
