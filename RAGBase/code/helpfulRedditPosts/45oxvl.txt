LPT: If you wish to save money, do anything you can to keep your finances a VERY private matter from friends and family.

content:
I had always had a bad time with saving and personal finance. After a huge evaluation I discovered that my family has been a huge cause of this very situation.

Unable to take care of their own finances, anytime I had gotten ahead, out come the hands. Pleading and begging. (The straw was my Sister claiming without my help her children would not have a Christmas, yet they plan a Cruise with her tax refund.)
So I put my foot down. 

Anytime talk of money happened in family/friend gatherings, I would change the subject, directly say I am not talking about money, or leave. (Those little loans did add up when I took them into perspective)

This has resulted in a single year my being able to completely escape the shadow of debt. While it may had cost me a few invites to things, I would rather be left out than used. (Same sister actually accused me of "Hoarding money" the first time I said no. If saving is hoarding then a fucking dragon shall be I.)


tl:dr: Money is a delicate matter and a private matter. You have every right to keep what you have to yourself. Save anything you want and it's nobodies concern if you "Hoard" money. When and if they get the hint you will be richer for it. Or better for losing their company.
