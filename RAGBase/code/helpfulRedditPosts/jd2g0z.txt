Edit: all’s I can Say is there is a lot of absolutely shitty lovers in here if you misconstrued or don’t understand this Message.  If you interpreted this an excuse for men or some type of defeatist personal message that I cant “make someone cum” grow the fuck up. 

sexual frustrations are real for BOTH genders 
 and this is a life pro tip on how to mitigate the anxiety and actually enjoy yourself. 

Peace out you salty fucks.
