LPT: Get a blank book and have each family member over 50 write down the life advice they'd want their descendants in 500 years to know. Keep adding to it and passing it down. You now have a family heirloom that won't be pawned off for drug money, and will only get more useful as time goes on.

Something I started for my own family around last year, which I think more people should do.  Call it a heirloom book or something.

Asking for advice that'll be useful so far into the future ensures that it'll be timeless, and gives people a chance to pass on their wisdom and be remembered long after they would otherwise be forgotten.  You can fill it with all sorts of stuff, from stories to family recipes to general LPTs.  Make extra copies whenever you have to pass it down to multiple children, too.
