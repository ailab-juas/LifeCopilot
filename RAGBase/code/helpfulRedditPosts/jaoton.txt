LPT: Closing your bedroom door at night, or closing your childrenâ€™s bedroom door while they sleep; greatly increases your chance of survival if there is a Fire.

content:
October is Fire Prevention month. While we can spend a lot of time on this subject, I want you to know, right now, that keeping your bedroom door closed while you sleep can save your life.  Keeping the door closed limits the spread of fire, smoke, and toxic gases into your bedroom. Giving you more time to wake and escape, or wait for rescue.
