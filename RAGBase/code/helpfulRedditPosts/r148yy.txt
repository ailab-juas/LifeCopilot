LPT: When you go to meet a newborn baby always bring a small gift for the mum, no matter what species they are.

New mums are feeling pretty wrecked.  A small gift really brightens their day.  I spend a lot of my time with animals so have been around horses with foals, dogs with puppys, kangaroos with joeys and  a whole list of others.  When a visitor comes, I can see that the mums love a treat.  Whether its a carrot or a dog treat or whatever is appropriate.  I've been a mum myself.
