title:
YSK That the hotel receptionists allocate your room

content:
Why YSK: I'm a receptionist in a 4* star hotel and I just thought to let you know that it's us that allocate the rooms for your stays. Some rooms are preallocated by Reservations (which I also do) but we can still change them. If you're rude to me OF COURSE you're going at the back of the hotel on the lowest floor possible, if you're nice to me you'll be on a high floor with the best view, if you're extra nice? I might give you a cheeky room upgrade, highest floor AND a view! :) kind of like waiters and spitting on food üòÇ

Be nice :)

EDIT 1: Thanks for the love guys! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also, it baffles me how many people can't even grasp the concept of human decency. Treat people the way you want to be treated they say, and who knows you might get something more than what you paid for. ü§∑

EDIT 2: I see many people commenting about the "kind of like waiters and spitting on food" line. I just want to say that I was only quoting a stereotype, I don't personally know anyone who's done it or have I done it myself. Just a little disclaimer üòä
