title:
LPT: Making decisions with someone indecisive? Ask them what they WON'T do.

content:
A lot of the time, people who have trouble making decisions are more firmly rooted in things they don't want to or won't do, rather than things they have a preference for. By asking for things they won't do, you narrow down your own options, AND you get input from them without pressuring them.

Similarly, you can lay out a number of options (say, 3 movies to watch on date night) and offer the person some number of "vetoes" (in this case, one). This way you don't make them unhappy, but again, you don't pressure them to make the decision.
