LPT: If you find a lost dog without a collar try putting on a collar and leash and walking it to see if it finds its way home.

content:
Last Wednesday we found a dog outside our home and took care of him for three days. Iâ€™ve called the shelter and posted on the neighborhood app and Facebook with no response at all. Right before I was about to take it to the shelter, I put on a collar and leash and realized that the dog was pulling me somewhere. I let him lead the way and just about a block a way we ended up back at his old home.

I also remember my old dog would somehow sneak out too but end up barking at my front door to let him in. In my experience, dogs know their way home.
