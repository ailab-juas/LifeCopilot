title:
YSK that tomahawk steaks are a scam

content:
Why YSK: Tomahawk steaks are just ribeye steaks with extra bone, which looks neat in pictures, but you're generally paying a 40 to 80 dollar upcharge for that piece of bone that does nothing to enhance the flavor of the steak. It's not like you can eat that extra 12 inches of bone, it exists only to look cool and cost you money. 

Just get a nice bone-in ribeye, you'll pay less and get the exact same dining experience.
