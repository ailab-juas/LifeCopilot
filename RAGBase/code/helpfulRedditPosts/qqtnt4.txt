LPT: If you accidentally call 911 and the call is already going through, don't try to quickly hang up.

content:
This looks like someone is trying to stop you from calling the authorities. They will call you back or may even send out cops to check on the situation. 

Stay on the line and tell the operator it was a mistake. 

That quick conversation saves a lot of peoples time and is probably a much better conversation than the operator was expecting. They won't fine or charge you unless you do this repeatedly or if you did it purposefully for a non-emergency situation.

Edit: Looks like from others experience they may send someone to check on the situation anyways depending on your locality or by the operators judgement call.
