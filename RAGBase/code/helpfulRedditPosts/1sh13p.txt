LPT: How to zip a dress when you can't reach the zipper

content:
If you are by yourself and need to zip a dress but can't quite reach the zipper over your shoulder, here's what to do. This will only work with zippers that have a gap in the metal. Before putting the dress on, run a ~2 foot long, thin piece of ribbon or a string through the gap in the zipper to the halfway point. Put the dress on and zip it as high as you can reach. Now arrange the ribbon over your shoulder, hold both sides, and pull up to zip the rest of the zipper. Pull on only one side of the ribbon to remove it. Yay! Now your dress is zipped. Perform the steps backwards to unzip. 

Note: Be slow and deliberate in your actions. You wouldn't want the ribbon to become caught in the zipper!

Edit: It figures that my most highly upvoted post would be a self-post :) On a sadder note, it's odd that something as simple and friendly as a tip for zipping up a dress brings out the ugly in people. Take heed, ladies! Today I learned that women who need to zip difficult dresses when they are by themselves:

* Are "forever alone"
* Need to lose weight
* Should get someone else to dress them, preferably a husband
* Should know all about wetsuits even if they have never worn one

Man. I dunno about you other ladies, but I for one am so glad that there are earnest redditors out there educating us about these issues. /sarcasm

Now, excuse me while I go rock the hell out of [this dress](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/heart-and-solar-system-dress).
