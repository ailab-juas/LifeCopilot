LPT: When leaving a major event/concert and using rideshare, walk two blocks or more away from the location of the event.

content:
You’ll likely avoid the surge pricing, and get picked up in half the time at LEAST. 

Otherwise, you’re competing with thousands of other people all trying to get a limited number of rides available, and logistically trying to make it work. 

Surge pricing is highest at the epicenter/location of the event, and drops significantly the further away from that location you are.
