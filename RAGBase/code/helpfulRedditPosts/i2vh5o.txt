LPT: If your laptop has an USB port with a lightning symbol next to it , you can use it to charge your phone or accessories without switching the laptop on .

content:
If the symbol is there but it doesn’t work, check your BIOS, you’ll have an option to enable usb power delivery .

Edit : You can enter the BIOS only during startup (before you see the windows icon) by pressing a key specific to your system manufacturer. It’s usually one amongst the function keys or DEL key in some cases . You’ll have more information in your instruction manual .

From the comments below,
It can be a yellow port as well . Also only works on USB A
