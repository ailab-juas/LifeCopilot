LPT: For most base level jobs not requiring degrees, there are actually a set of magical words to say in the interview to set yourself above a large percentage of the competition. They are, “I am looking for a career, not just a job”.

After hearing and seeing many logos of employers stating they are in the business of making “careers, not just jobs”, I decided to make that a staple for something I say at some point in the interview process at almost every job I interview for. 

I have had tremendous success in it, and have found they will literally eat that shit up like fucking mom’s spaghetti. 

95% of the time they reply with something along the lines of,

“That is EXACTLY what we are looking for,”
