LPT: Do not sit in the first few rows of a roller coaster when riding it at night.

content:
You will without question have a face full of bugs before you reach the bottom of the first drop. Typically 4-5 rows back and you're safe from the bug debris. 

More bugs are out at night and the lights they use to illuminate the interesting parts of the coaster attract swarms ready to be splattered on your face like Fabio taking on a bird.
