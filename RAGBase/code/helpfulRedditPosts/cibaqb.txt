LPT: Try to think of chores as "self care"

content:
My therapist tells me to practice "self care" which I've always interpreted as hygiene/beauty related stuff. This kind of thing just really isn't my thing. I have a simple skin and haircare routine that work for me and wear makeup once in a while, but I don't paint my nails almost ever and don't really want to up any of those things. I've started to define "house care" as "self care" more. It kind of takes a bit to make this switch, but it also kills two birds with one stone. You're caring for the house YOU live in, the clothes YOU wear, the dishes YOU eat off of, etc. You deserve a clean house, clean clothes, and clean dishes, taking care of those things are part of taking care of yourself ♥️
