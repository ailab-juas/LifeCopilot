YSK that just because you have an undergraduate degree in one area, that doesn't mean you can't get a graduate degree in an entirely different discipline.

I have an undergraduate degree in biochemistry,  but I wanted to get a graduate degree in engineering.  I had to take about ten undergrad classes before they would accept me,  but I didn't have to get an undergraduate degree in engineering.  And when I was in my degree program,  I was surprised at how many of my fellow grad students had degrees in biology, biochemistry,  and chemistry.  

I now have a PhD in engineering.

Edit: I have several hundred people who have asked me for advice. I promise to reply to everyone, I only ask that you please be patient with me as I work my way through the list.  :-)
