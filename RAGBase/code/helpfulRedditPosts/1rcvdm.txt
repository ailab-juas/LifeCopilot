LPT: Agree on a code phrase with your kids so they can identify friendly strangers

content:
My parents did this with me when I was a kid and I think it was a good idea. Obviously you want your kids to be careful about strangers approaching them - but what if they need to trust some OK stranger? Exemplary scenario:

Imagine you need to pick your kid up from school/soccer practice but right before leaving you get a call with some kind of emergency you need to attend to. A co-worker you trust offers to pick up your son/daughter, but they've never met. You tell your co-worker the code phrase and they can identify themselves to your kid as someone trustworthy you sent to get them and not some lying predator.
