LPT: Normalize taking mental health days as PTO

content:
The more people that schedule and plan regular mental health days, the more this practice will become the norm. You are fully in charge of your PTO so you should never have to give a reason for why you need a day off. If you take these days regularly, you won't have to work your ass off--get burned out--then feel that you have to fake being sick or have a "family emergency" to miss a day. Also, you control what you do on that day off, so you can lay in bed all day, get caught up on chores, or pamper yourself with "me" centered activities like going to the movies or getting a massage.
