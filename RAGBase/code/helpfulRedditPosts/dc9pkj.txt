YSK that if you take a loved one to the airport and it's hard for you to say good-bye, you can request an escort pass to go through security and all the way to the gate with them until they board the plane.

content:
Because in the good old days before airport security existed, loved ones were able to walk all the way to the gate and say farewell. Now I was worried that I wouldn't have much time with my loved one before he went through security yesterday but I asked the ticketing agent if I could go through and she was overwhelmingly accommodating. After my loved one granted approval, the ticketing agent issued me what looked like a boarding pass with no flight information.  With that escort pass and valid ID, you pass through security with no problem, and get to spend more quality time with your loved one.

Edit: Caveat: the ticketing agent and the loved one both have the right to say yes or no to the issuance of the escort pass. My ticketing agent told me I was lucky I ran into her that day.
