LPT: Wear a headlamp when you clean.

content:
The focused light will highlight stains, dust, hair, liquid, grime, etc. That is normally missed in regular cleaning. 

Found this out because I had to clean under my bed and put on my headlamp to see. Afterwards I forgot I had it on and was surprised as I looked around my house and found more dust, hair, stains than I could see with normal lighting. I have 4 pets so I have to go ham on cleaning, and boy did I find a lot more hair than I usually do.

I spent at least an extra hour cleaning my house. And will clean with my headlamp on from here on out. 

I promise, once you see the nasty stuff you've been missing when you clean, you'll make the change! Assuming you're a clean freak like me ðŸ˜…
