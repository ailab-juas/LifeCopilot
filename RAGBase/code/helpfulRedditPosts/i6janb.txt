YSK If your think your dog is starting to become senial and showing signs of old age, there may be something wrong, and it may be worth getting them checked out.

Im writing this with hope it could possibly help another pet partnership somewhere. My dog is 10, and started to become a less energetic, and wanted to sleep more. We went on a walk that was comically slow, and i figured shes probably just tired and getting old. Its easy to assume everything is normal and its simply just old age or an off day. I recently found out that she had a tumor as well as cancer. In hind sight, there was signs and my dog was trying to tell me, but I wasn’t hearing it because i wasn’t listening for it. Please, listen to your pets if they are telling you something. My auto pilot was just to think “shes getting old, her hips are probably sore”. 
Once we had the tumor removed she seemed 2 years younger, she is so full of life and happy. Its easy to write off changes to the easiest explanation that comes to mind, but theres a chance theres more to the story. Take a step back and think about a check up. It could reveal something your not seeing. It has the opportunity to give new information to the situation, and possibly save their life. At the very least, give you the chance to appreciate the last part of their life with them.
