LPT: If you procrastinate unpacking after a trip, make the first step dumping entire suitcase onto bed. Now you'll have to put things away before sleeping.

content:
I would always get home from a trip and just leave my suitcase partially unpacked laying on the floor. I discovered something that always forces me to unpack faster.

I first dump the entire contents of the suitcase onto my bed. Now *at least* my suitcase is empty and I can put that away.

Second, in order to sleep that night I have to clear off the contents of my bed. And since it is all spread out (rather than trapped in the half-open suitcase) I can make faster progress at putting everything away.
