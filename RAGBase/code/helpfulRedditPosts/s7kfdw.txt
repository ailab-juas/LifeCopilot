LPT : Practice good dental hygiene when you are young. Its difficult to rectify the damage when you are older. This may seem like common sense but people often neglect dental hygiene.

content:
Start practicing good dental  hygiene from a young age. 

Brush twice a day and floss at least once a day. You will have less issues with your teeth and gums when you are older. Flossing is very important and it is something that is often overlooked. Flossing is as important as brushing. 

It is also important to develop a good brushing and flossing technique. Make sure you use a brush that is able to reach behind your molars. Don't forget to brush your tongue !  

Your future self will thank you !
