YSK to avoid “for profit” universities like DeVry University and UPhoenix. They are known for scamming their students and giving unaccredited degrees.

content:
Recently there has been a surge in commercials on YouTube and on the internet for colleges such as DeVry University and the Art Institutes.

Despite how attractive these schools appear in commercials, these “universities” are FOR PROFIT. This means that they exist to give shareholders and the CEO of the “university” money. These places do not focus on educating their students or doing research. Recruiters will often accept students to these colleges without looking at transcripts or other reports. They will also lie to you and try to lure you in to their institution. 

Most students who attend for-profits end up in mountains of debt, with a useless degree, and with tons of wasted time. The “degrees” given by these colleges are completely useless and many employers do not accept them. Credits at these schools don't transfer either, so you won't be able to continue your education elsewhere.

When you apply to college, make sure you look up whether it is for-profit, non-profit, or public.

The universities that care about your education and have regional accreditation are almost ALL non-profit (like the Ivy Leagues), or public (state schools). These colleges also tend to be cheaper.

Always do your research before applying to a university, and make sure you know that your degree will be useful! Many of the people who were scammed by for-profits could be living great had they gone to a state university. 


RED FLAGS TO LOOK OUT FOR:

-Recruiters constantly spamming you
/The college accepting you without looking at your transcripts or test scores
/Tons of commercials online
/A “CEO” and shareholders


FOR PROFITS TO BE AWARE OF:
DeVry University,
The Art Institutes,
University of Phoenix,
Strayer University,

Don't let their innocent names fool you.
