YSK that Amazon let's you try on clothes before you pay for them.

content:
I noticed something new on Amazon today. They have a new promotion called "Amazon Wardrobe" which is included in Amazon Prime.

You can pick a minimum of 3 items and Amazon will send them to you free of charge (only if you have Prime). From there, you have 7 days to either pay for your items or return them. Obviously, you pay for any items you want to keep and return any you don't. The boxes they send are resealable and they have prepaid return labels, although I'm unclear on whether they automatically send printed labels with your order or if you have to print them yourself when you choose to return something. Seems like a great idea, considering the amount of people I see online who are unhappy with their Amazon clothing purchases not looking like they'd expect.

Happy shopping everyone.
