YSK that if you leave refrigerated food out of place in most grocery stores, it will be thrown out and wasted.

content:
While I worked grocery at Target, I saw so much food junked just because it was 'out of temp.' Even if it still feels cold to the touch, we are instructed to throw it out to avoid the possibility of food poisoning. Even if you've carried something around for a while and decide not to buy something (let's say, milk) put it back where you found it if you don't want to waste it. Even if you put it in a different refrigerated area, it could be trashed.

I assume that this is true with other grocery stores.

EDIT: I know that I may not be hitting a 'target audience' here, as has been mentioned. But honestly, the thought never even crossed my mind before I got the job. You never know who isn't aware, idiotic or street smart. And thanks for the comments!
