LPT: A lot of people forget this, but if you ever have to call 911 and they ask what medications you're on, we're asking for supplements you're on too.

**UPDATE: I'm going to use my 15 minutes of Reddit fame to recommend that everyone in this thread at least think about getting CPR certification and ensure that if they already have it, that it's up to date. Good, effective bystander CPR can save lives and is only surpassed by the prompt usage of an AED. There's my spiel.**

A lot of supplements can actually have adverse reactions with particular medications, and the ER needs to know everything you're putting in your body medication **and** supplement wise. If we're treating an adverse reaction, it helps to know that. 

Note: Also, if you're on illegal drugs, TELL US. We're not cops, we just need to know the best way to take care of you. Edit: Another clarification. I'm not saying to say that you're on drugs on the recorded call with 911. I'm saying that if you're in the back of my ambulance and I ask if you're on drugs, **tell me.** Particular drugs can reduce your ability to breathe properly and if you're on narcotics, I want to be able to have my BVM and intubation equipment nearby just in case you stop breathing. If you're on acid, I'll probably give you a teddy bear and a blanket and if you're on marijuana, I'll probably share my Pringles. (Kidding, I can't feed you.)

Edit #1: Since people are complaining so much about my phrasing, let me clarify- dispatch will more than likely not ask you for all of your medications. As an EMT/Paramedic, though, I **will** ask you what you put in your body. This is a LPT to help clarify that supplements are over the counter medication. You take a supplement to do something, right?

Edit #2: Holy shit, this made front page? This is my first front page post ever! Thanks you guys! I just hope this actually helps potentially save someone's life some day.
