LPT: If an older person shares a common meme with you, pretend you are seeing it for the first time.

content:
They do not know or care if you are a meme expert with 15 years of meme knowledge. If your grandma shows you a meme she thinks is funny, you should try to see it from her perspective, just enjoy the meme for what it is. Have a laugh, or maybe show her a similar meme.
