LPT: If you believe your employer may be discriminating against you when it comes to pay, do not be afraid to ask your coworkers what they make. It is a federally protected right to speak about salary.

content:
In the USA, since 1935, there has been a federal law that prohibits any company in the private sector (and as of 2014, also the federal sector and federal contractors) from discriminating or terminating an employee for sharing their salary with others.

Keep in mind, there are certain positions that are specifically excluded from this law:
- Workers in religious schools (they must follow the school's rules)   
- Agricultural Laborers   
- Airline employees   
- Supervisors (who aren't classed as "employees" for this purpose)  
- Independent Contractors 

While it may not be specifically stated in the law, positions in Human Resources or financial positions may also be prohibited from speaking about pay in certain instances, since they often handle money. 

Keep in mind, that while an employer can not stop you from talking about your salary in general, they are within their right to ask you not to do it on company time. 

Also, keep in mind that while you are within your right to talk about salaries, you should be careful who you tell.

Telling someone who has worked at your place of employment longer, that you make a lot more than them can have a potential impact on how they see you in a work environment. However, this can also give them a reference and bargaining chip during a yearly review.
