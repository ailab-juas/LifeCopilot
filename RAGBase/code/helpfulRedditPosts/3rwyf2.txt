YSK that you can mail back your empty credit card applications to avoid clutter.

content:
So, if you're like me, you get your fair share of credit card and insurance offers in the mail.  90% of those offers come with a "business reply envelope."  If you apply for a credit card offer, you use the business reply envelope and postage is free to you.  The postage is NOT free to them.  Every time one of those envelopes go through the mail, the credit card company pays for the postage.

So, I take my offers, tear them up and stuff the torn up offer, along with the envelope it came in, and all the other paperwork included in the business reply envelope.  No return address is needed, since it's guaranteed postage.  I put it in my mailbox and send my junk mail back to them.  Cuts down on the amount of trash I throw away, and helps the post office make a few cents at the expense of the credit card company.

If you're really paranoid, you can write VOID across the application in Sharpie before you tear it up.

I've been doing this for years.  As dumb as it may sound, there is a certain amount of smug satisfaction every time I send back a credit card offer empty.
