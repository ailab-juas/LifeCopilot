LPT: Smoking doesn’t relieve stress unless you’re already a smoker

content:
I don’t really know if this is the place for this post, but I feel like this is useful knowledge for people.

I was a smoker for a few years (haven’t had nicotine for 5 months), and I have a lot of friends who would make jokes when they were under stress of like “can I have a cigarette? I’m so stressed”

Smoking nicotine doesn’t relieve stress unless you’re already hooked on it. Most people get into smoking because they think it’ll solve some sort of stress but it doesn’t until you’re too deep. 

Save yourself the struggle of nicotine addiction, there are other ways to relieve stress, your first pack (at least) of cigs won’t do anything for you except get you a potentially life-ruining addiction.
