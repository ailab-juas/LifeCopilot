YSK that if you work in a restaurant and somebody comes in demanding a sugary beverage such as sweet tea or soda for a diabetic emergency, it may be a life or death situation and you should provide it ASAP

For some reason a childhood memory popped into my head just now. We were driving somewhere with another family and their mom was in diabetic shock.

My mom stormed into an Italian restaurant demanding a sweet tea. The staff were hesitant. Meanwhile the lady in distress was not in her right mind and she needed sugar in her body as soon as possible, before she was too incoherent and combative to drink it. The adults were worried about her getting behind the wheel.

Don't worry about money or ringing them up. Even if your management is absurd enough to fire you for it, you'll not have a death on your conscience. Hopefully the guests will pay after the crisis.

I'm not diabetic, but I have experienced low blood sugar from loss of appetite. I feels like you're drunk and is a little terrifying. I couldn't drive a car and had to get a friend to pick me up. My situation was different because my insulin system was functioning, but the experience showed me a glimpse of diabetes.
