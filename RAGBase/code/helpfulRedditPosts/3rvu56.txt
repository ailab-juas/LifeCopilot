LPT: Avoid the "credit card machine broken" scam in taxis.

content:
Travelers are always in a hurry which makes them prime targets for scammers. With credit card machines now a staple in most U.S. taxis, some drivers are trying to find creative ways to regain their lost cash revenue. One such way is by claiming the credit card machine is broken during trips to the airport. Some even say it is downloading software. 

There are a couple of ways to avoid this. First, if it is broken, call the taxi company number and pay over the phone. An option for the software scam is to simply say you will wait until it is complete. Usually it will miraculously fix itself after a few minutes.  By appearing not to be in a hurry can prevent you from becoming a victim.
