LPT: Compliment your friends every now and then or even tell them that you care for them. It may not be significant but it can brighten someone's day.

I'm always the one reaching out to all of my friends/classmates. I regularly send classmates, "Happy Friday!" or "Happy Birthday!" messages so that everyone feels cared for and loved. Though at times it is tough to see that no one reaches out to me to ask how I'm doing or just to reach out to me during rough times.   


I usually go weeks, I guess years now without anyone acknowledging the small things I do. It's rough and it does take a toll on me.  


Life can be tough alone, and it's easy to realize that everyone is busy with their own lives. But reminding others can make a big difference and you never know the impact it may have in the long-run.
