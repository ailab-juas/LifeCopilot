LPT: Use the built in citation system in Word for easy citations and reference generation

content:
Many do not know about it but it has saved me a lot of time going to some website. It automatically formats citations and stores the references for the future too. I have never been marked off on a paper while using it.

EDIT 1: Here is a link to where it is: http://i.imgur.com/7CgJk4W.png

EDIT 2: For those seeking to ensure a perfect, up-to-date, fully featured citation system, many are suggesting the use of programs like [Latex](http://latex-project.org/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). The benefit of this tip is to feature a quick function that complements a program that many students already use.
