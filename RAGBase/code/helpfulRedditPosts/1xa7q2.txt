YSK that many lilies are toxic to cats. Be careful when buying Valentine's Day flowers!

content:
Looking through Valentine's day bouquets online, I have noticed a lot of them have lily species that can be toxic to cats. This is a toxicity that I have seen a couple times working at an emergency veterinary clinic, and I know that it's relatively unknown by the public. If your cat does get into lilies, please get them to a vet clinic ASAP for supportive care, as damage to their kidneys can start within just a few hours. 

I have a bit of a nightmare about someone buying flowers for their cat-owning significant other and their kitty dying from ingesting them... so just please be careful. 

If they have a dog, be careful with the dark chocolate, too!
