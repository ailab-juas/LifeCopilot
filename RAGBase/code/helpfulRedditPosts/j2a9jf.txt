title:
YSK that the reason your Kids don’t wanna eat Vegetables, might stem from you just not knowing how to cook them right.

Why YSK. Childhood Obesity is on the rise across the globe. Within The US being the most prevalent. The main cause of this is Over Indulgence in Processed High Calorie foods, a diet low in Fruits and Vegetables, and low mobility/exercise.

But parents who try to get their kids healthier by increasing vegetable intake are mainly unsuccessful. Stating that their “kids just don’t like Vegetables”. However most of the parents who say this don’t put nearly as much effort into making the foods taste appealing as they do with the main dish. Many will simply take a bag of Peas or Broccoli and just boil it from the bag, adding nothing. 

Instead of boiling in a bag. Try to cook in a pan or oven and add different types of spices and herbs. And on top of trying to cook differently, see if can you do the same with the main dishes. 
Rather than making baked or boiled chicken with broccoli on the side. Spice things up and make chicken tacos with onions, peppers and whatever else you can find. It’ll not only show your child that anything can taste good. But that you’re putting time and effort to make sure that what they eat is appealing and tastes good.


TLDR: Season your vegetables so that your kids don’t rely on burgers and candy for a sense of flavor
