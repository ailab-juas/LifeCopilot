LPT: if you want to get fit for next summer, you have to start now!

content:
Reminder: a good physique isnt built in 3 months. you need dedication and time. so, if you want to see some results in the next summer, start hitting the gym right now!

you dont need an exact workout plan or expensive supplements to start your journey. just work with what you have. your first goal should be, that you try to make hitting the gym or the place where you work out a habit. if you achieve this, you will see the results.

start getting in contact with your friends and form groups. that way you will have more fun working out and it will be a social event, so win-win.

i know youre gonna rock this. see y'all at the gym!
