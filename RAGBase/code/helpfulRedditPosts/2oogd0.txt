LPT: When thanking someone, try to include their name. It shows them you're grateful that THEY did something for you, and not only that it happened.

I suppose this applies mostly to a professional setting. 

Let's say you're busy putting in a customer's order at your restaurant. Your coworker notices this, and goes ahead and brings out that side of ranch for you that another table wanted. Saying, "Thank you, Taylor" lets her know that you appreciate HER helping you out, and not only that the side of ranch was served.

EDIT: I guess I worded this a little weird. But I hope you get the idea.

EDIT2: There's a lot of angry people on this post. Wasn't expecting that.
