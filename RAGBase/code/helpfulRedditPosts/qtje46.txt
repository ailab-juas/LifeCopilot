LPT: Teach your kids this technique on how to get your attention politely when talking to others.

content:
If you're in a conversation with others and your child wants your attention, teach them to put their hand on your wrist, a non spoken cue that they want your attention. In response you put your hand over theirs, which indicates to them that you are aware of their needs and you will give them attention shortly when it's appropriate to interrupt or end the conversation you're in.
