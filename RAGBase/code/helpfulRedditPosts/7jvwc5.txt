 Edit:  **ITâ€™S TODAY!  YOU HAVE UNTIL MIDNIGHT. **

For most people, this is the last opportunity to secure coverage for 2018, or switch from an existing plan. Those who fail to sign up on time could face a penalty and have to wait until next year to obtain coverage.

If you have questions, call 1-800-318-2596 to speak with a trained representative 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
