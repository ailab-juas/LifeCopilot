LPT: When packing for travel include a box of snaplock/ziplock sandwich bags

content:
They're useful to keep dirty things separate from clean things, to keep wet things separate from dry things, to contain small tubes, bottles etc that might leak, to keep different kinds of currency/tickets etc separate, to protect small fragile things (slightly inflate the bag before sealing) and to store small items that are at risk of getting lost. And of course to package snacks.
