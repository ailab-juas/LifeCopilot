LPT: If you receive good customer service through call/text/chat, PLEASE take the extra 30 seconds to leave them a good survey.

content:
You may not think it matters, but it does. Upset or frustrated people will ALWAYS leave a survey, so leaving good feedback will help mitigate some of those. Also to keep in mind, even if the questions do not sound like it, they likely impact the person you interacted with, e.g. How likely are you to shop with us again? That question should be thought of as, "How likely are you to shop with us again based solely off this interaction?" These surveys impact reps livelihood more than you realize. If they deserve the bad feedback, by all means, let em have it.

EDIT: I didn't mean to take ALL surveys, just the ones who obviously did EVERYTHING they could to help. Yes, I know it's what they're paid to do, but some people, including myself, do stuff for people that's outside my scope of business to make it easier for you.

Also, I must admit, I was only thinking of the surveys within the businesses I've worked in the USA. Mobile communication and tech support, and large chain home improvement online support. I realize there are a lot of other types of customer service, and maybe I should have specified, sorry.
