YSK how people treat you is not a reflection of your value or who you are

# Why YSK:

Shitty people are everywhere in the world. And sometimes even the best of people can do shitty things. Focusing too much on what you might have done to deserve being treated in a specific way, or wondering why someone you love would hurt you often just leads to pain without solutions.

*Quick disclaimer: This is a HUGE topic and there's no way anyone can get to the bottom of this in just a few paragraphs. This is just a humble attempt at catching the most important things*

Don't get me wrong. If you shout "FUCK YOU!" to someone, then don't be surprised if they call you a cunt in return. But there is a big difference between that and a good friend lying to you, family keeping secrets, a partner cheating on you, or in general someone you love doing something that hurts you. Expescially when there's no clear provocation.

&amp;#x200B;

In my personal experience people usually end up hurting eachother as a result of poor communication. I think this poor communication can be divided into a few different groups

1. Not knowing properly what is important to the other person ahead of time
2. Not communicating about how others have hurt you before
3. Not communicating to someone how they specifically might have hurt you before
4. Not being honest when something does happen that would hurt the other person

People might still end up hurting you even if communication has been excelent though. In these cases it's still not a reflection on you, your value, or your person. It's far more often a projection of who the other person is.

# So what can be done?

1. **Trying to avoid the missteps in communication listed above**Inquire about what matters to other people and don't be afraid to ask deeper questions concerning what they care about.
2. **Lead by example**Being open and honest is difficult. Espescially for men in a macho-culture or anyone else in an environment where feelings are frowned upon. However it gets easier the more people embrace the emotions of others as well as themselves. Start with the man in the mirror and be supportive of others. Even if you disagree with their moral values or decisions.
3. **Make it easy for others to communicate with you**Respond positively and constructively when someone is open and honest with you. Try to avoid making a joke of things unless you've established that this makes it easier for the ones involved. When someone does hurt you; try to understand what lead up to it and how it happened, rather than laying blame. Look for solutions to the problem at hand and don't be afraid to accept your part in it. (I have never experienced someone making me regret taking on any blame. I personally also think the relationship is more important than being right)
4. **Some people are toxic or just incompatible**Sometimes things hurt or just doesn't work for reasons we can't do anything about. This also means there are people we will be perfect with for reasons nobody else can change. Don't worry too much if someone hurts you or things don't work out with someone specific. It's not because you're bad or because you deserve to be treated poorly.

**P.S.**   *Please don't hesitate to critisize this if you disagree or feel like i missed something very important. I hate the thought of giving bad advice and would rather take this down if there are significant flaws with it.I should also say that I'm not an expert on any of this. I just love to learn and felt very inspired after reading about moral psychology. I felt a great sense of mastery when i applied what i've learned to my real life experiences and simply wanted to share some of the things that have improved my life the most*
