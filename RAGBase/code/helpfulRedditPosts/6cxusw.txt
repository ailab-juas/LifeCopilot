LPT: Initiate handshakes with professional women just as you would with men.

content:
I'm always surprised to see men not initiating handshakes with professional women as they would with other men.  I've made a conscious decision to do it with everybody regardless of sex.  It's interesting that some of the women actually acknowledged it - so it must not just be me.

Edit.  Thanks for the upvotes.   I wanted to note that some have commented that it may not be the same in all cultures so know your circumstance.  
Edit 2:  apparently the person of higher authority should initiate a handshake.  I never really knew this and think it's kind of silly.  But be aware.
Edit 3:  It's interesting to see so many different points of view in the responses.   I'm speaking primarily about US Business.   Be aware of the cultural and religious implications before initiating handshakes in other countries.

Thanks for the upvotes.
