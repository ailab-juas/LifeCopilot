LPT: Do not engage trolls. Do not burn any bridges.

content:
There’s a rule most sane New Yorkers go by to stay safe when dealing with crazies in the city. The rule is: do not engage. No matter how badly you want to say something or do something or retaliate, even if it’s verbally — it’s best to just ignore it. 

Same goes for online arguments. You’re not gonna get the other person to see your side, not ever. You’re not going to make that person think about their bad behavior or choices. So just like if you were in NYC: do not engage, do not feed the trolls. 

Same thing also goes for relationships that have turned sour. You’ll get over your negative feelings in time, but others will never get over how you negatively treated them and retaliating, even just verbally, is setting you up to have a huge fallout. Instead, either kindly divert the conversation to something else, or slowly fade into obscurity. You never know when you’re going to have to deal with this person again, such as a professional setting, and you do not want them talking trash about you to others. Which most people are more than elated to do.

Edit: a couple of people brought up that these rules shouldn’t apply to all negative interactions, and I totally agree. These tips are intended for minor to moderate issues and they’re intended for you to adhere to them as a means of self preservation. 

Another user mentioned that this shouldn’t apply to abusers or oppressors. I completely agree. Utilize the public forum and advocate for rights. Contact the authorities even if he takes all your courage. Burn those bridges with tires and jet fuel.
