LPT : You can easily retrieve unsaved closed documents on windows. Nice in private life, and can win some easy good points at work. Done by using the "roaming" file.

Hello,

For the small story, father lost hours of work by closing Excel file by mistake (angry and sad) found it back in a few minutes with this trick :

windows+R (windows key is windows icon bottom left of keybord)  
It opens a "Run" box  
Run : %appdata%  
It should open the roaming file.  
Open the microsoft file from roaming.  
Open excel (or Words or whatever "Office suit soft" depend on what you lost)  
Open the "whateverthename UNSAVED" file.

There you go, you didn't lose your last Xhours of work just by forgeting to save, or computer crash etc. Nor your coworker, or you manager.

I think it's worth sharing, not everyone knows the trick
