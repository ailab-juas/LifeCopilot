YSK: You should support “kill” shelters. They are usually state owned and are required to take in every animal that they are given.

content:
They simply just don’t have enough resources/funding to care for all the animals that they get. By supporting them, i.e. adopting from them, you are directing helping them not to have to put down any animals. Boycotting “kill” shelters just furthers the problem.

“No Kill” shelters are usually privately owned and can take in the animals they want. Because of this they don’t exceed their capacity or the amount of animal they are capable of caring for, so they don’t need to put down any animal. 

[Here’s](https://youtu.be/lpaKT6v_mAw) a good video from Kitten Lady that goes more in depth into this.
