title:
LPT: For People That Drown Their Coffee With Sugar

content:
Before putting the sugar into your coffee, take a small sip of the coffee (without the sugar.) Then add a little bit of sugar in. Since your taste buds first tasted your coffee without sugar, this smaller amount of sugar will have a much sweeter taste. You end up using less sugar and having the same effect (Maybe even sweeter!)

enjoy!
