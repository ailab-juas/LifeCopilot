title:
YSK that men can also develop postpartum depression

content:
Why YSK: This is a mental health problem that not many people are aware of. Obviously women have much higher rates of it, due to the bodily and hormonal changes that occur during the entire pregnancy and birth process. But men should know that they also experience hormonal changes during this time and that, while itâ€™s less common, as many as 1 in 10 fathers will have depressive episodes after the birth of their child.
