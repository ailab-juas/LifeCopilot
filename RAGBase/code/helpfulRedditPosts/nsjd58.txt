YSK: Gas stations in California are not allowed to charge for air and water.

content:
Why ysk: The air and water machines at gas stations are coin operated. There is seemingly a charge for this service. If you read the fine print, they sometimes call it a donation. If you ask the attendant to turn it on, they will either give you a token, or they can turn it on for you. Voila! Free!
