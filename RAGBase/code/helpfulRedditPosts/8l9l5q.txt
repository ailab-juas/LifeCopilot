YSK that signing up for a "free" credit report with experian.com will charge you a monthly fee

content:
Experian.com claims this is free and charges you a $1 credit card charge to verify your credit card info. However, if you read the fine print you'll see that this also signs you up for a monthly $20 charge if you don't cancel the trial period. 

Apparently cancelling over the phone is a huge pain, so here's an easy way to do it (learned this from Andrew Dennis on Quora):

1. Go to https://usa.experian.com/#/profile/myMembership/reason after signing in
2. Choose a reason from the dropdown menu
3. Click "confirm cancellation"

This cancels your membership without having to get on the phone.
