YSK that you can have a used car checked by a mobile mechanic before you buy to avoid scams, lemons, or a car that's about to fall apart. Look for “pre-purchase car inspections” for your city.

In my area it costs about $100 to check an older model car for basics, more for a newer/more thorough inspection. When I sold my car I paid half of the inspection to show good faith and to make sure I was not selling him any problems. Even if you have to pay the whole amount, though, it could save you a lot of money and headaches.

Edit: Lots of great comments. Thanks. If the seller will take it to your mechanic with you before you purchase, that would certainly be even better than a mobile mechanic. Someone I know recently spent $1,200 on an old car that lost its brakes within the first few days, and having a company check it out, mobile or brick&amp;mortar, would have saved her a headache.
