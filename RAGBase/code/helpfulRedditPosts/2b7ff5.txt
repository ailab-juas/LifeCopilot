title:
YSK that credit card purchases frequently bestow a warranty on the item that you purchased.

content:
Most credit card companies automatically provide a short (30-90 days) warranty period for items that you purchase with the card.  So if the merchant refuses to allow you to return a defective item for a refund, your credit card company will buy the item back from you.  Check the terms and conditions of your cards.
