LPT: Shop for kitchen supplies at restaurant supply stores

content:
I've been into 2 or 3 and they've never asked if I actually work at a restaurant. Restaurants need good quality for a great price, so instead of paying for the brand name of the knife, you get the features for a lower price. Whether it's knives, storage, cutting boards, mixing bowls, all sorts of stuff, you'll probably get better options, better features, and for a fraction of the price of name brand consumer aimed products. 

Last time I bought a knife they have good options for $8-16. It got an 8" Santoku with a wide blade and rubber grip handle, and it wasn't even the most expensive option. Consumer Santoku knives were starting at $20-30 for a smaller knife without the features. If you want nice looking stuff, you may want consumer stuff (I think of it as do you want to look like you cook or do you want to actually cook). If you want functionally better for a better price, the restaurant supply store may be your hidden gem.
