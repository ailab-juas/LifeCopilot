YSK: Sleep apnea and other serious sleep disorders can be linked to a list of mental disorders that can be overlooked because fatigue is a common symptom of most of the disorders.

 Psychiatric disorders often are developed with obstructive sleep apnea and other serious sleep disorders. These include depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, and substance use disorder. 

Why this is important? In clinical studies, patients reported a decline in their pre-existing mental conditions and a significant increase in overall mental health when compared to people with similar treatments not including effective treatment of a sleep disorder. Many patients reported fatigue as a symptom during the preliminary diagnosis of the mental disorder and the possibility of a sleep disorder was overlooked by their primary care physician.
