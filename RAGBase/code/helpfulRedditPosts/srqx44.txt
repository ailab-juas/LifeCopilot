LPT: Invest in period-proof underwear if you like creampies or are trying to get pregnant (NSFW)

content:
For if you don't have time for a shower, or gravity hasn't yet done its work and you need to leave the house.

No-more slippery feeling ten minutes into your post coital walk. Feeling secure knowing no weird leaks are visible. Don't know what else to say except this is a lifesaver and changed the game for me.

Edit: fascinating how controversial this is proving to be. Friends, there is a delay between 'the act' and 'the drips'. Sounds like some people would rather this happen in thin cotton underwear than a slightly thicker underwear designed for fluids. You do you!

Edit again: Pee after sex guys. Obviously this tip doesn't preclude that, please stop wishing UTIs on me x
