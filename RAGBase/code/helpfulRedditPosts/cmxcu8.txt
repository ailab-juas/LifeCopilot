LPT: Don't ignore the small muscles. They will wreak havoc later if you forget them.

content:
* Find out what your piriformis is, and stretch it. Especially if you have weak glutes. That piriformis can be an angry little muscle that will cause other muscles to tighthen up.
* Learn about your rotator cuff, and how to strengthen it. It could save you some shoulder pain.
* Anyone know of any others? Those are the ones that have plagued me and people that I know.
