LPT: Prevent a Double Chin by Sticking Out Your Tongue

content:
I've never told anyone this, but when I was about 25 I started getting a double chin, even though I wasn't overweight. My dad has a pronounced sag under his jaw and I was afraid I was going to be stuck with it as well. So I read up on it and learned that a cause of a double chin is weak muscles in the lower jaw. I noticed that sticking my tongue out seemed to work those same muscles so I started sticking my tongue out as far as I could for a minute or two every morning (for a count of 100 to be precise). Within a short amount of time (I'd say a couple of weeks) it disappeared. I've been doing that for 15 years now and my chin looks the same as it did when I was 20.
