LPT: Make it harder for creepy men to follow you in their cars by walking on the side of the sidewalk that goes against traffic.

content:
I frequently get catcalled by men in cars late at night. I get off late from most of my jobs and walk home alone. 

I live in Canada. Here, the cars drive on the right side of the road. So, taking into consideration the direction you're going, if you're walking on the left side walk, the car lane closest to you will necessarily be going in the opposite direction. This allows traffic to make it harder for creepy men to follow you - they would have to do so from the opposite side of the street. 

I've done this for years and I've noticed a drop in persistence and occurrences.

Hopefully it helps someone stay safer!

I'm surprised by the number of redditors who say this is common sense so that cars are more visible. After reading more comments, I realized it's largely rural redditors who don't always have sidewalks where ever they go, so it is a smart safety tip. In cities with sidewalks everywhere, and the direction you face when walking is typically determined by the way you need to go after exiting an establishment. Crossing the road as a pedestrian is also j-walking in dense cities (it's a fineable offense), so I've never seen any public recommendation to always adjust your walking to face against traffic. 

That cultural rural vs urban difference is interesting!
