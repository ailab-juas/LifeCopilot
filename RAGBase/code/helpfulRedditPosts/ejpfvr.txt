title:
YSK that in most sentences you can replace the word "but" for the word "and" to make the sentence seem less confrontational/disappointing.

content:
"You're a great employee, but I need you to come to work on time."

"You're a great employee and I need you to come to work on time"

It just creates a psychological cushion while "but" automatically makes the listener defensive.
