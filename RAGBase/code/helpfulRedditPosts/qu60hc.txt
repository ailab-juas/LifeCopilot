LPT: With the holidays fast approaching, just a reminder if someone declines alcohol, do not press them as to why.

content:
Whether it be medication, personal preference, pregnancy, or addiction, the bottom line is: it's none of your business. 

Four years ago I was "outed" as being in recovery because an insensitive "bro" wouldn't take no for an answer. Now, I have no problem being open and honest, but I was still coming to terms with it at the time. Him loudly exclaiming, "well it's not like you're some wino, live a little" was mortifying for me and totally damaged our friendship. 

Also please understand the holidays are a difficult times for those in recovery; after New Year's, rehabs and meetings are generally packed. I am at a point in my sobriety (four years) where I can handle others drinking around me, but it is a process and took time.

Edit: Also due to religion. My apologies, did not mean to exclude anyone!

Edit 2: I'm going to bed, but for anyone that needs it, please check out r/stopdrinking. Also feel free to PM me! Might take me a bit as I've gotten lots of messages but I have a variety of tools that may help you (they helped me, but can't make any guarantees), including community support, I am willing to share. Just know this post comes with zero judgment, only love and care. Stay strong, y'all!.

Edit 3: Sorry I did not include medical reasons. This list is by no means exhaustive, and it can also just be a personal preference, but the point stands. Lock down those boundaries and do not feel the need to apologize for anything!
