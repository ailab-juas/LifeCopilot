YSK if a family member dies and debt collectors tell you that you're now responsible for paying the deceased's debts, THEY ARE LYING. Debt does not pass to anyone else upon death.

This is a common tactic of bill/debt collectors, especially with medical bills (which a lot of people rack up in their final days). Debt does not pass to anyone else upon someone's death. They can get paid from the estate, but, depending on your state laws, they're usually pretty low on the order of priorities. If the estate is insufficient to pay the debt, they're written off. Don't get tricked by these shady bill collectors. You are NOT responsible for your loved one's debt (unless you cosigned for the debt of course).

For example, see Wisconsin's statute below:

(1)  Classes and priority. At the time of their allowance, all claims and allowances shall be classified in one of the following classes. If the applicable assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all claims and allowances in full, the personal representative shall make payment in the following order:

(a) Costs and expenses of administration.

(b) Reasonable funeral and burial expenses.

(c) Provisions for the family of the decedent under ss. 861.31, 861.33 and 861.35.

(d) Reasonable and necessary expenses of the last sickness of the decedent, including compensation of persons attending the decedent.

(e) All debts, charges or taxes owing to the United States, this state or a governmental subdivision or municipality of this state.

(f) Wages, including pension, welfare and vacation benefits, due to employees which have been earned within 3 months before the date of the death of the decedent, not to exceed $300 in value to each employee.

(g) Property assigned to the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner under s. 861.41.

(h) All other claims allowed.

#**Edit:** 

First, I apologize for not specifying USA. I was very tired when I wrote this post.

I did put at the bottom of the post that your state's laws may vary and to contact an attorney with any questions. However, it's my fault for not putting that in large, bold font. I fixed that.

Second, I see a lot of questions regarding spousal debt. In many states spousal debt is co-owned, so upon death it's not passing to anyone. Therefore, this post doesn't apply. Again, check your local laws and contact an attorney with any questions. 

**If you're low or moderate income, there may be nonprofit organizations, a local law school clinic, or a pro bono attorney who may be able to help you with basic estate planning, living will, power of attorney for health care and/or finances.**

I wanted to post this because I had a client who had debt collectors calling him telling him he should pay off his dad's credit card. The debt collector was very manipulative in these attempts. I just wanted people to know that, in most cases, these debt collectors are lying. 

Finally, also note that there's a difference between collecting from the estate and debt actually passing on to family members. If you are the executor or personal representative of the person's estate, you might get these debt collectors calling trying to collect from the estate, but you're not personally responsible for these debts.

US ONLY. STATE LAWS MAY VARY. CONTACT AN ATTORNEY WITH ANY QUESTIONS.

#Edit 2: 
Laws differ state to state with respect to marital property and how this situation works with **spouses.** The post was more meant as a caution for parents/children, siblings, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, etc. Your children don't inherit your debt, in most cases that I can think of. The debts are paid out of the estate, but they don't transfer to your kids (or siblings etc.) making them personally responsible. 

Beware of deceptive practices by debt collectors. Someone below posted a good way to report debt collectors for violations.

**I'm seeing a lot of confusion about what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about debt collectors lying to family members and telling them they're PERSONALLY responsible for the debt. I'm not talking about creditors coming after the estate or how you have to deal with that if you're the executor or personal representative of the estate.**

**I just wanted people to be aware and not get tricked by these debt collectors. (Not all debt collectors are bad. Some are great; they work with people, follow the law, and tell the truth. I'm talking about the slimy ones who lie or guilt people into paying even though they're not the people legally responsible.)**
