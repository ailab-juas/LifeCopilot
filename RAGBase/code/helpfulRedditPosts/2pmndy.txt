LPT: Windows 7, Re-shake a window will return all collapsed windows back to original positions.

content:
We all have experienced it, youâ€™re moving a window around on your screen and you accidently shake it. Doing so collapses all other windows that are open. If you let go of the window you shook, and re-shake the same window. All of the collapsed windows will return to their original positions.
(Windows 7, 8, and 8.1)
