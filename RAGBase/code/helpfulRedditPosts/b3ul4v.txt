YSK about Dark Reader a browser add-on that inverts black and white on a website and effectively creating a "night mode" for every website you visit, which protects your eyes by inhibiting your shortsightedness!

content:
My eye sight was getting worse everytime I had to hardcore-study for exams (12h/day for min. 2 months). I read that scientists found out that black text on white ground was causing your eyeballs to grow and develop shortsightedness, while white text on black ground stops this process.

I only use it for a week and I don't know if that actually works, but it defenitely protects me from headaches. I also inverted Microsoft Word by changing the MS-office Theme to grey and doing the same for the paper color. Be aware that it's a change and you sometimes want to revert, but do you eyes a favor and try to get used to it.
