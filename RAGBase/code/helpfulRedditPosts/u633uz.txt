LPT: Your future self is going to wish you had started saving earlier regardless of your current age. Start cutting back and investing in later now

content:
Although I was told to save early, I fall into the camp that didn’t have this figured out until my mid 30’s (but still not too late). Your future self is either going to be glad that you did, or regret that you didn’t - and there is no middle ground. Start cutting back on expenses, investing, and being diligent with your money TODAY. Even a few dollars per day will go a long way 20 years from now and it is a guarantee that you will be glad that you did.
