YSK how to make the perfect hamburger.

content:
I see this all the time.  It is horrific to watch.  People making burger the WRONG WAY.  Let me tell you  the right way:

* You buy 85/15 ground beef.  Anything more lean is going to really diminish the flavor.

* You wash your hands and dry them.

* You pick up a handful of meat, however much meat you want, big or small doesn't matter.  

* You DO NOT smash the meat up and form it into a pretty ball and then shape it in to a pretty perfect patty.

* The more you handle the meat the more tough and not delicious your burger will be.  

** DO NOT MAN HANDLE THE MEAT!  **

* You take the handful of meat and you slap it between two hands like a meat high five so it is 1/2 inch thick.

* You do not make it pretty.  You do not handle the meat. 

* You sprinkle some salt and pepper on both sides and slap it on a hot grill, or griddle, frying pan whatever.  

** DO NOT SMOOSH DOWN THE BURGERS WHILE THEY ARE COOKING FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY! **

* You cook the burger one one side, flip it over and then cook the other side.  

* Give it a little poke with your finger

Red juice comes out that shit is rare.

Pinkish greasy looking yellowy juice is medium.

Just greasy juice is medium well.

Dry with no juice is nasty. 


If you would like to add things like cubes of cheese, jalapenos, onions etc.  press them into the raw side of the burger after you put it in the pan. 

EDIT: ---------------^ Cubes of cheese not sliced cheese.  Sliced cheese goes on the cooked side.  
EDIT 2: Toast your bun and even better smear butter on it and toast it on a pan/griddle/flattop til caramel color and crispy.  This creates a barrier and prevents the bun from becoming soggy.
