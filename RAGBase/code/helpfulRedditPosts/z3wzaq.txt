title:
LPT: Place silverware at the END of the buffet, not at the beginning

content:
Granted that it’s a small thing but I think it’s a good Life Pro Tip since it’s something that almost everyone gets wrong by putting the silverware at the beginning of a buffet with the plates. There is no reason to force your guests to try to carry the silverware, napkin, wet nap, whatever with them while they are going down a buffet while trying to serve themselves. Most people try to hold their plate and everything else in one hand while trying to use the other hand while trying serve themselves. Put the plates at the beginning of the buffet but put everything else at the end of the buffet so they can have both hands free to serve themselves down the buffet. They don’t need these items while going down the buffet and they can grab these items at the end when they are done serving themselves.

Edit: this is a LPT so it is meant for buffets at family gatherings not restaurants
