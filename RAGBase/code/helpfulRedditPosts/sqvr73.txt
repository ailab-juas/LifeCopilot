title:
LPT: if you have problems being productive on your days off, take a morning drive

content:
I was telling my friend a while back that I had trouble finding the energy to do anything on my days off work. He recommended to simply drive in the morning to get a cup of coffee or breakfast. Surprisingly this helped more than I thought it would and has consistently kept me productive on my days off.
