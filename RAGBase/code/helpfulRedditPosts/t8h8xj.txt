YSK if you have a hard time using stickers, you can get magnet sheets, put the sticker on it and cut it out to have fun magnets you can use for years.

Why YSK: a lot of people love stickers but have a really hard time using them since, well, once you place it down that’s it. If you don’t use them though you can’t enjoy them and they end up sitting forgotten about in a drawer somewhere. If they are magnets though you can put them in a lot more places, and they will actually have a functioning use unlike a regular sticker.
