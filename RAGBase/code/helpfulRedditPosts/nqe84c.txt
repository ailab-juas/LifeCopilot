LPT: If you stay at hotels regularly, or are planning a getaway, download the Traffick Cam app; it helps you take photos of your room to upload to a worldwide database to fight slavery and child sex trafficking.

content:
Child pornographers, paedophiles, slave traders and child sex traffickers all use hotels as a way of getting victimes away from loved ones and as an "anonymous" location to defile and victimise innocent people. 

Photos help authorities identify locations in child pornography (and other equally horrific footage and photography); elements such as furniture, paint colour, linen, tiles and layout can all assist in determining a timeline for when footage was taken. 

Go to www.traffickcam.com to find out more and get direct links to the iOS and Android apps.

Edit: Please also look at the [Europol](https://www.europol.europa.eu/stopchildabuse) site from time to time to see if you can identify any of the locations, objects or images. Thanks to u/miffyonabike for this tip and the link.
