*Why YSK*: A lot of people tend to live life worrying too much about what others think of them. While it might be a scary thought, a lot of people need to realize that people just aren't thinking about them. And that's fine! Research has shown the human brain has been wired to be selfish and care more about itself. So live life to the fullest and stop worrying about what others think about you!
