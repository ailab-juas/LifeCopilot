LPT for those desperate for work and willing to move: many towns and cities across the US are offering incentives to move and get a job in their town.

Quincy, Illinois is paying $5,000 to new residents. Savanah, GA offering $2,000. Topeka, KS offering $10,000. The Ozarks is offering $10,000. Tulsa, Oklahoma is offering $10,000. This obviously isn't an option for everyone, but it may help someone!

I live in Quincy. They are doing a 5k tax rebate for eligible residents who moved here within the next year and get a job here. Our local grocery store has a starting pay of $17.00/hr. Our local factory (Knapheide) will train you in welding/ car body painting/ and other skills while also paying $24.00/hr- and they hire felons, people with poor work histories, people who legitimately need a fresh start, and people without experience. Our cost of living is very low. My 900 square foot 2 bedroom apartment was $500 a month. The current home I own is a 3 bedroom and I purchased it for $89,000. I moved here specifically for the low cost of living- as I was a struggling single mom at the time. I'm sharing, simply because this place was a new start for me- and it helped me greatly. Maybe someone else can get a new start through one of these new resident programs as well.
