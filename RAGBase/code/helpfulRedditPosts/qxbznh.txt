YSK: having a pedicure isn't feminine

content:
Why YSK: If you have a job where you walk/stand a lot having a pedicure semi regularly to have a check up/maintenance is really important. It will prevent serious problems that would take medical attention.

Edit: I'm not talking about washing your feet, I'm talking about corns and such
