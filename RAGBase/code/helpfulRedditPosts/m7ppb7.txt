LPT: If you're feeling low, treat yourself to a good cry. "Crying for long periods of time releases oxytocin and endogenous opioids, otherwise known as endorphins."

"Crying for long periods of time releases oxytocin and endogenous opioids, otherwise known as endorphins. These feel-good chemicals can help ease both physical and emotional pain. Once the endorphins are released, your body may go into somewhat of a numb stage. Oxytocin can give you a sense of calm or well-being."  


I was wondering why I felt so much better today after how low I was yesterday, the more you know.
