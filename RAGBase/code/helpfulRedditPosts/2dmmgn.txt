LPT: After eating Sweets or Sugary foods or drinks, drink water to help dilute the sugars in your mouth and stop them from harming your teeth.

content:
Surely brushing your teeth or using mouthwash would be the recommended dental health thing to do as this isnt a substitute to those daily things but you can do this all day and its worth doing immediately after sugary foods and drinks. 

Evidence - some dental hygene websites all say the same thing - plus i found using a straw helps to keep the juice or soda pass your teeth as you drink.

"Use a straw to keep soda away from your teeth. After drinking soda, rinse your mouth with water to dilute the sugar and acid that cause tooth decay."

edit: removed a sentence that sounded like me saying to brush your teeth right after eating sweets - DONT DO THAT! Thanks to /u/tedford
