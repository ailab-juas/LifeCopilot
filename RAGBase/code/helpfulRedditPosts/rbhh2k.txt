YSK: You want to get your life, disability, and long-term care insurance BEFORE getting your genes tested

content:
YSK: Life, disability, and long-term care insurance providers can discriminate based on genetic testing results. Health insurance providers can't. (ETA: This applies to the US. Other countries are different. Thanks to the commenters who pointed that out.)

Why YSK: Health insurers are forbidden to discriminate on the basis of genetics. Other insurers--like life, disability, and long-term care--aren't. So if you think you'll want genetic testing--and odds are you will someday--it's wise to get your life, disability, and long-term care policies set up first.
