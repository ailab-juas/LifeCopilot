LPT: Don’t try flirting with people at the gym or their place of work

content:
I saw someone asking a question about how he can flirt with a girl at the gym. The answer is you don’t. Most people who are there want to either work out or just take a break from the outside world. Trying to flirt with them only makes it awkward for them if they see you there every time now. Same goes for the waiter, waitress, or barista. They are paid to be nice to you. Don’t try getting their number. 

This doesn’t mean you can’t make casual conversation if you’re in a regular fitness class together or getting coffee is a daily routine. But don’t force it lead to anything more.

ETA: responses are wild. Guys thinking they have the right to flirt with whoever they want whenever they want. Society is doomed because you can’t bother people anymore. 

And people who don’t have reading comprehension and think I was talking about co-workers when I clearly said people in service industries where you are the customer
