LPT - when people do their job really well, ask whether you can tell their management about it. It's a simple act but creates great positive energy.

I recently had a great experience asking the realtor that helped me find a great place whether I could tell his management about my experience. The guy offered an incredibly professional service - way beyond what I paid for. He agreed and I wrote a consice and to the point email to his manager. One week later the realtor called me and told me that his boss took him out for lunch as she was very pleased about his performance. 
Later on, I asked the same question to two tax advisors that again delivered a great service. They told me that no-one had ever asked that before. They were smiling, they were proud. They deserved it. However, due to the way their organization is organized, they told me I could not leave a review. Nevertheless, I probably made their day. Again, because they deserved it.
Try it. It takes no effort but makes a difference.
