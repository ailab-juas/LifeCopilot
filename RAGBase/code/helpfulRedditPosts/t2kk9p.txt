LPT: when going abroad, download the Google Maps app, open it, and type “Ok Maps” in the search field. This allows you to download a selection of the map to your phone, allowing you to use it for navigation while not using any cellular data.

Edit: thanks to u/gozertank for the helpful comment:

“And while you’re doing that, if you have the Google Translate app, you can download languages you plan on using often so you can translate without using data.”

Edit 2: as many of you already pointed out, you can also just download offline maps from the settings in your Google Maps app.
