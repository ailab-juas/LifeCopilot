LPT - Avoid lending money to friends or family. But if you must lend it, think of it like a donation (like the money won’t come back)

content:
My mother used to say this all the time. If you must loan money to someone treat it like a donation. Incase for any reason it doesn’t come back it should affect your life too much. I have seen so many people lend money and that money never comes back and they really depend hard on it
You end up losing a lot of friends and family too
