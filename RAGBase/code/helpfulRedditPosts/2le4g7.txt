LPT: Caught in a "why?" loop with a child? Just respond with "Why what?"

content:
I am referring of course to when a little snot decides to perpetually ask "why?" for the sake of saying "why" and nothing else.

"Dad, why is the sky blue?"

"Because the sun's rays reflect off of earth's atmosphere at an angle that makes the blue part of the color spectrum point towards earth's surface"

"Why?"

"Why what?"

"..."

Works like a charm.

EDIT: generic comment about being on the front page!
