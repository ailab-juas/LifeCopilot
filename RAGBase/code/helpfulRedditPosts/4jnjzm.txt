YSK about a little rental scam you may see when looking for a new residence

TL;DR
Too good to be true rental opportunity. Renter needs credit report from specific site: doesn't give information because property doesn't exist. Name used was Missy Fedler. The post has been removed from CL as of now.

While I was online looking for new apartments, I found a three bedroom house for rent. Beautiful. Attached garage, marble island in the newly finished kitchen, two bathrooms. The catch? $850 a month. in *colorado*. 

Right away I knew it was off, but I couldn't risk losing the opportunity if it was legit. So I inquired, asked for the address since it wasn't listed. She responded quickly and claimed another applicant had applied but couldn't move because of school. The next part that caught my attention was the fact that she refused to give me an address. First official red flag. There's no reason whatsoever that a serious renter wouldn't want to display the address. 

She then went on to say that all she needed was a credit report from a "trusted site" and including a handy link to a site called eFreeScore.com. For $1 credit reports. Then the address would be released to me, and I could schedule a viewing. 

I naturally asked if I could use a report from another site that I had already paid for. She replied saying they only accept this site, because it is trusted and urged me to act quickly, because she's getting a lot of emails from prospective tenants and right now I'm first in line for the property and I could lose out if I don't get my report sent to her.

My final reply was that if she gave me address, I would gladly get the report for her. But not before searching the home by the title and finding it listed in 4 different states, California and Florida.

She then said the home was taken and I returned to the site that I found it(still listed even though it was filled) and reported it as spam/scam.

So what would have happened if I paid for the credit report? Well a scammer would have a dollar in their pocket and after they collected their money, they would claim the unit was no longer available, either that my credit was denied for whatever reason or that it was taken by another tenant.
