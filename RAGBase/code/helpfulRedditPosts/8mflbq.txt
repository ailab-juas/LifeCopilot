YSK: Bleach is more effective at killing germs when it's diluted than when used neat. Bleach starts to lose potency after around 6 months. Bleach diluted with water is only good for about a day. Bleach is corrosive to stainless steel â€“ wipe down with water or ethanol afterward if use is unavoidable.
