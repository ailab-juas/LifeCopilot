title:
YSK Not to stop the flow of traffic to let someone pull out.

content:
If traffic is moving you should not come to a complete stop to let someone out of a parking lot. To add to this, don’t block the box.

Why YSK-

It’s an accident waiting to happen. Never mind if they’re turning left the other side of oncoming traffic may not stop and could result in a multi car crash. Just keep moving, when the road is clear they can pull out. It’s common sense not to block the box but it seems I’m seeing more and more impatient drivers everyday. You will cause a road block, and inevitably cause traffic, which just backs everything up. Please be patient and keep traffic moving.
