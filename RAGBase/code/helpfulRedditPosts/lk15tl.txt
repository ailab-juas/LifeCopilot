title:
YSK if a small business hooks you up with free stuff, or discounted services don't word it that way in your review.

content:
Why YSK: This can attract the wrong type of customer to the business, and lead people to expect things that are not advertised. 

If you want to help the business mention things like "went above and beyond" "came in under the estimate" "always willing to work with my needs." This can drive traffic to the business, but won't attract people expecting handouts or discounts.

I have known quite a few people building their business who have done discounted work to get it off the ground, or just as a favor trying to help someone in need out. It is great work at FAR below market value, and then that person turns around and tells 5 friend, but they also mention they got the work done for X rate, when the business usually charges Y rate.

Edit: For clarity I am not condoning shilling.

Edit 2: My first awards - thanks so much! I'll be sure not to mention them in your review  /s

Edit 3: If you get an item completely free, and you have no bill, especially if you know ahead of time, and especially if the owner says something like I would love to hear your review - absolutely mention that you got it for free. But if you go to a place that you are a regular and they don't charge you for dessert, or give you 10%/20% off, and you aren't expecting it, that is different than shilling, come on people.
