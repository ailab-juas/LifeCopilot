LPT: If it snowed and your house doesn't have snow on the roof evenly spread out you have bad insulation.

content:
**I understand that the snow may not be even. It will be noticeable if there is a problem, and this is for asphalt not metal**

Your neighbors homes will/should have snow spread out across the roof. A roof on a house with bad insulation will have dry spots without snow or no snow at all on the roof. Another way to tell is if you have an unusual amount of icicles. 

Fixing/trying to fix the problem can be expensive but it is worth it if you can afford it. You are able to do sections at a time if you would rather, but if you do it by yourself you should wear breathing masks so that you don't breathe in the dust in the attic. You should do this especially if your house was built before 1990 and hasn't had any improvements done on the insulation. I really think it's worth it to do the upgrades in the long run. 

Edit: **If you live in an area that doesn't snow** here is my idea (this is also just a guess) You could try getting a temperature of your attic floor and the temperature of your ceiling under your attic and see if there is a major difference on a very hot day when the inside of your house is cool. If there isn't a big difference you probably have poor insulation. I'm no professional though. 

Edit: Obviously it isn't the only thing that may cause the snow to melt/go away but it is something people rarely think about.

Edit: While people are reading, energy efficient windows, air conditioner, etc. is totally worth it. You should also recycle and pick up your own trash. No other animal leaves behind trash like we do. It's disgusting and the oceans are awful. We don't need so much plastic. Screw the people polluting the rivers in China.
