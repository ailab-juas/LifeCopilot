LPT: When stressed by a situation(s), take a moment to think whether you will even remember this event in 5years.

content:
Think back 5 years on what you remember and relate it to today. When you actually do think this is that important, elevate and focus on the event. I struggled for years with thinking EVERYTHING was important. When I heard a variant of this in B-school, it changed my life. Since then, I had the strength to do things like take 6weeks off for the birth of my kids. I ignored the stress impact of a million small things (that used to keep me up at night). It gives so much perspective that it changed my life. I use the rule every day in sorting issues.
