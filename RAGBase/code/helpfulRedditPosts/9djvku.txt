LPT: If somebody comes to your door selling a home security system and asks if you have one, always say yes.

If they ask which company, tell them it's none of their business.

Many people looking for homes to rob will come to your door asking about security systems. It gives them a chance to case the home and look for weaknesses like if you don't have a dog or if the house is homed by women or the elderly.
