LPT: discussing your salary is OK with people who are at the same company in the same position.

content:
It's very taboo to discuss salary with people, and that's true to an extent, if you discuss your salary with your co workers you can measure up, and see if you're getting ripped off or not, if you and a co worker have the same experience, and some what of the same resume and theres a big difference it might lead you or him/her to realize that the company should pay more, use this as leverage to discuss salary increases. Companies thrive on this taboo because they know people won't discuss it, and they can get away with paying employees a lot less than they deserve, this is especially true for new college graduates.
