LPT: When doing research for a paper, annotate each article. Then write a summary of the article. Once youâ€™re finished with the summaries for each article, write a brief analysis of all the articles. When you start your paper you will have your own analysis, summaries and paraphrased information.

Often times it can be very difficult to start a research paper, but that's because we aren't properly analyzing the research. We skim it and patch-write it into our papers which is a form of plagiarism (which means failing a class or expulsion in some cases). Follow these steps to help synthesize all of your information and create a paper where you feel like you have a good sense for what you're talking about.
