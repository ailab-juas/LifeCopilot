title:
LPT: If you lose focus while listening to an audio book, try turning the reading speed up to %120.

content:
If that helps a little but not enough increase the speed in increments of 3-5%.

Edit: I'm a fast reader and like to listen to audio books in bed.  If I'm tired listening to someone reading a book at  a pace half that of my reading speed, I lose interest quickly.
