LPT: when going out hiking, always bring a lighter with you. It could mean the difference between life and death.

content:
If you’re heading off to go on a hike (no matter how short/long) always make sure to bring a lighter with you. This small $2 item can mean the difference between life and death as It can be very easy to get lost when hiking in new locations and worse yet, we often aren’t prepared for it and weather can change in an instant (hypothermia is no joke). Having a lighter can quickly aid you in starting a fire which is of utmost importance (#1 in survival) in such a scenario.

EDIT: I just wanted to thank all the kind people that left awards/upvotes for this post and want to thank everyone for the additional suggestions/tips as there is a lot of great information here. Obviously take care anytime a fire is being built and do so safely and take care out there.
