LPT: Not being overweight isn’t the same as being in shape. If you don’t use it, you lose it. Start with 10 minutes of moderate exercise a day...now!

I have a sedentary lifestyle and although I am not overweight my clothes aren’t fitting like they used to. I was very athletic into my teens and early 20’s but now that I am in my 30’s my body is soft and weak. I used to do push-ups like they were nothing and now I can barely do 10. It’s common knowledge that your muscles deteriorate from lack of use and yet here I am acting all shocked that I’m turning in to a bag of bones and dough.      It’s not the end of the world and I am making progress but I wish I had taken care of my body instead of taking it for granted.
