LPT : Hire professional movers as soon as you can afford it.

content:
I move every 2 or 3 years. Not entirely by choice. As I was slowly making more money, I forgot calling pros was an option, and I kept moving the way I always did : by calling friends.

But calling friends for moving help gets tougher as you reach your 30s. Beer and pizza aren't cutting it anymore, people have bad knees, back problems, and more generally a thousand acceptable excuses. And that's when you still have friends. On the other side, you have more stuff than ever. Furniture, books, record collection... unless you're collecting trading cards, you have more stuff now than 10 years ago.

So don't sweat it, literally. Call a good moving company. If you want to pack your stuff yourself, they provide everything weeks in advance, quality boxes, tape gun and man-sized rolls of bubble wrap. You leave the furniture, TV, frames, clothes racks (with the clothes on), you can even leave bracket lamps on the walls. The day-of, they will pack those with care in extra special bubble wrap and special boxes and empty the place at an incredible pace. Don't blink or you'll miss it. Also you're not crippingly sore afterwards, the furniture is in place and you can start unpacking immediately.

It's not cheap. It's better if you have an SO to share the expense. But it's the kind of luxury that really makes a difference, especially in places like here where renting a place can be overly complicated. The whole ordeal becomes much easier, honestly. So my LPT is to save up for this !
