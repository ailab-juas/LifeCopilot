LPT: When trying to lose weight, use a smaller plate when eating

content:
Because your food portion is larger relative to the plate, your mind will be tricked into thinking the portion is bigger overall. 

Source: I lost 60 lbs with little actual diet advice except for this. 

Edit: A lot of commenters are saying that they would just get another serving, therefor they'd be consuming at least the same amount of food. However, my original thought in making this post was to relate the smaller plate idea to the Completion Compulsion in eating. Basically the Completion Compulsion means that your more likely to just finish what's on your plate than to stop eating when you've had enough. And I have nowhere else to go with this edit so I'll just stop here before I write anything too dumb.
