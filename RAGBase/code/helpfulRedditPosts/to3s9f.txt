LPT: if you’re traveling use the big chain truck stops, loves/pilot/flying j/TA

I’m a trucker and I’ve come to know these spots really well.before I was a trucker I knew they existed BARELY.but I had no idea how great they are. These big truck stops are always well lit at night. The restrooms are always very clean.they still have the normal snacks gas stations have and they even have some better choices like fruit cups and small salads. There’s also different fast food places attached if you’re more into that. Hell they even have clean hot showers if you’re in need of one for like 12$. Good luck out there and be safe!
