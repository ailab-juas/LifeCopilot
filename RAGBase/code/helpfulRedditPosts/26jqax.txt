LPT How to remember something in the short term

content:
Sometimes you want to remember something really important. For example, to bring along that check you have to deposit, five minutes before leaving your house. Or to return a call.

Just cross your fingers: for example, the pinky and the ring finger. Don't uncross them until you accomplish your task. It will be mildly annoying, but you won't forget anything.

It seems dumb. But it works like a charm. Is easy, doesn't require notes, and you will remember. I've been using this for years.

EDIT 1: Thank you for the GOLD kind stranger. I'm crossing my fingers to remember this moment. But I do mean it. Is not that I crossed my fingers because I'm faking it.
