LPT: When buying audio books, buy the Kindle E-Book then add Audible narration, instead of buying Audible first. It is usually MUCH cheaper.

content:
From my experience it is around 50% off the Audible price to buy the Kindle version then "upgrade" to Audible after purchase. Audible Gold subscription gives you 30% off, and it's still usually a lot less than that.

They sell it like this as an incentive to spend additional money after buying the eBook. But, if you plan on buying the Audible version of a book anyway...



Edit: If you're interested in audiobooks, you should also check out "Playster". It's like Netflix but with audiobooks. It's $14 a month for unlimited audiobook streaming (also download function to app [Audible doesn't even have streaming function, which is kind of annoying!]), and they really do have a great selection.

Edit2: Librivox is similar to Playster, but 100% free. It has public domain titles and amateur recordings, but they can be great!
