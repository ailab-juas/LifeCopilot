title:
LPT: when visiting your (grand)parents make a picture of yourself with them. You may regret not having one sooner than you think.

content:
 Your loved ones may die sooner than you would expect. And afterwards you will probably find that there is no good picture of the both of you together. Especially if you are young. 
Next time you visit them, have someone snap a good one, or make a selfie. You won't regret it.


Edit: For a lot of you this clearly hits home. I'm so sorry for all your (recent) losses. I wish you and your family lots of strength and love!

Edit2: Holy fuck, front page! :o
