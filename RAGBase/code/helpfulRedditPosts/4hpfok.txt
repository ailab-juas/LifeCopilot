YSK there is a LYRICS button near the bottom right corner of Spotify that will display lyrics to a song you're listening to if they are available.

I find this handy since I can skip a few steps like going to google and doing all that typing and clicking. I've found that many songs have them and they also scroll along with the song.

Further, if you want to be a good samaritan and find a song that doesn't have lyrics you can upload them yourself!
