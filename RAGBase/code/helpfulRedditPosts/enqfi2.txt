LPT: Don’t buy video games full priced. Create a backlog of discounted games and play through those while newly released games will inevitably go on sale within a year (sometimes with the DLC included). You’ll spend a fraction of the money you would have and eventually will be able to buy more games

Obviously if you are super super excited for a title scoop it up but most of the time just wait. I was really excited for DMC 5 but didn’t want to spend 60 bucks on it. So I spent my time waiting playing Last of Us, Stardew Valley and DQ11 which I got each one discounted (LoU for free through PS+). Now DMC 5 is 20 bucks. I only buy a game if it is an ABSOLUTE must have day one which is hardly ever for me. Now I have a great back catalogue of games and I don’t feel pressured into buying next Gen this year because I have so many titles to play through.

r/patientgamers is an amazing subreddit if you want some motivation to make this change
