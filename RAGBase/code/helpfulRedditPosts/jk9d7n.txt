LPT: Know you're about to get fired? Then for heaven's sake don't throw your resignation in first in one last show of defiance. The meeting where they let you go is your chance to extract a great severance package and positive references. Employers want a clean departureâ€”don't make their life easy.

content:
If things have gone sour but you think they're on shaky ground, hold your nerve and stay the course. Your future self will thank you for it.

Edit: Lots of debate about whether you are getting fired, laid off, terminated, fired for cause, or whatever. The point is: you don't make your situation better by quitting right before they fire you. Their documentation will be the same: terminated for xyz.

Edit2: The 'severance package' might amount to just securing a supportive reference for your next job.
