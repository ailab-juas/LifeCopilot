LPT - Use Reese's Peanut Butter Cups instead of herseys chocolate when making s'mores.

content:
I went over to a friends house for a bonfire in high school and her family was making s'mores. Turns out they used Peanut butter cups instead of herseys chocolate and oh my goodness. I havent looked back since. Felt pretty dumb tbh that I had never thought of it myself considering reese's peanut butter cups are my favorite candy. Now I pass this knowledge onto you! You're welcome.
