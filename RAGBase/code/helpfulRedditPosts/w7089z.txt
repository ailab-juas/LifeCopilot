YSK that for you guys, you can get the "last drop" out quickly by a simple gesture

content:
 Ok guys, I'll tell you something you'll thanks me all your life for.

When you finished peeing, put your finger down there, behind your balls, just between your legs, and push gently upward. You'll feel the last drop stuck coming forward and going out your penis.

In fact, your urethra does something like a valley and "the last drop" is the lake in this valley. You can see it [here](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-3-030-21447-0_2/MediaObjects/468369_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg) (crossed by a black line).

Why YSK: The "last drop" is a struggle for many men as it often finish its course in the underwear and this inconvenience can be avoided easily.
