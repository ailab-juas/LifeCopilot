EDIT: I've been reading the posts. Thank-you's to those who share very useful information.
I left a word off the title 'cause I was in a hurry.  It should say, "...American Red Cross's CEO".
I understand that non-profits need good CEO and that there are costs involved when running an organization.
I don't think that people should stop donating because of this but they should know going in that it IS a business.  When donating money and goods, one must know about the charity (http://www.charitynavigator.org/) so why not the same when donating blood?
