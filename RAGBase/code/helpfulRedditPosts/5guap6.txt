LPT: When using your laptop in bed, put a large book underneath to help with ventilation and maximizing battery life.

content:
Because bed sheets and comforters tend to clog the airways for fans, laptop devices can overheat fairly quickly. By using a book as a barrier, you get more battery life from your device AND as an added bonus, you won't have to listen to your laptop pretend it's a plane preparing for taking off.
