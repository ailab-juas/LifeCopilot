YSK if you're used to getting a deal from a place from a couple employees, that doesn't mean you are entitled to said deal from everyone. And by saying you are used to getting said deal to a manager, you are screwing over the employees who have been hooking you up.

And you won't get your deal from those employees anymore, and you could very well be jeopardizing their employment there, so just keep your mouth shut and be happy with what you get.
