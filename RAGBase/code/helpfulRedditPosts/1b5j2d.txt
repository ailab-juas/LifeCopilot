LPT: Tired of people swarming into the elevator when you're trying to exit? 

content:
Right before the elevator door opens, move up and stand dead center facing the door just an inch from it. When the door opens, people ready to crowd in will be mildly shocked to suddenly be nose to nose with you, so they'll automatically back up and give way. I figured this out about ten years ago and it has never failed me once.
