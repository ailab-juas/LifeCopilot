title:
YSK the difference between the Nazi and the religious Swastika

content:
Why YSK: Not all Swastikas stand for the Nazi symbol, the Swastika predates Hitler and is part of many cultures and religions around the world.

It was stolen by Hitler and tainted to represent hate and bigotry. He pretty much appropriated the culture of the Indian Subcontinent. This symbol tilts at a 45° angle (called the Hakenkreuz)
Edit: I've learnt that the Nazi symbol doesn't always have a tilt.


The religious Swastika is commonly found in religions of Hinduism, Jainisim and Buddhism. It usually has 4 dots in the middle and stands for divinity and spirituality. If you visit India, you will encounter this in a lot of public spaces.

PS: I am not a religious person

Edit: A word

Edit 2: You should also know that the name "Aryan" is a pretty common Indian name and does not remotely stand for the ~~so called~~ "Aryan Race" that Hitler always talked about.

This post was inspired by [this TIFU](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ildpw6/tifu_by_naming_my_child_a_racially_charged_name/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Edit 3: Many different cultures/religions have their own adaptations of the swastika(clockwise, anticlockwise, multiple arms), the only purpose of this post is to point out the difference between a well known symbol of hate and a religious one.

**Swastika doesn't always necessarily mean a Nazi**
**But if you are a Nazi/NeoNazi, GO FUCK YOURSELF**


Edit 4: To the Redditors calling me anti-semitic for this post, that was not my intention. If some other religious symbols was appropriated by the Nazis, I'm sure those people would be frustrated too.

Edit 5: A heartfelt thanks to all the Redditors who game me awards

**Final Edit:** Many people pointed out in the comment section that Hitler did not appropriate the Hindu Swastika but actually the Hooked Cross (Hakenkreuz in German) symbol which he first saw in a Christian Monastery.

The Hooked Cross is a sacred symbol and can be found in old churches as chapels.

The word Swastika comes due to translations throughout history. Mainly the translation of Mein Kampf by James Murphy.


In conclusion: The Swastika which has its oldest mention in the Vedas(15th-5th century BC)  is found is many many cultures throughout the world.

/u/BigHoney1987 put it well
&gt;Not every culture revolves around the Western scope of history and they shouldn’t have to. Adapting a more global view of history can help us all understand each other a bit better!


In world where it easy extremely easy to jump to conclusions, it is also easy to take out your phone and Google things we may not know about.
