YSK: Google maps has a feature that alerts you if a taxi driver goes off route

content:
This is useful to avoid the common taxi scam where the driver takes a much longer route with many unnecessary turns. It only notifies you if the taxi driver takes a route, more than 500 meters away from the fastest route it found.

Edit: Here is [how](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/21/google-maps-keeps-you-safe-by-alerting-you-if-your-taxi-goes-off-route/):
To get Maps to track your ride, look for navigation directions to your destination, and tap the Stay safer button in the menu at the bottom. You'll find the off-route alerts there. Enable them then start the navigation.

Edit 2:
