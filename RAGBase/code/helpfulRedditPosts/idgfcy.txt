LPT: don't buy the first car you test drive. The salesman is lying. No, this car will not sell within the next 24 hours, so you shouldn't reserve it with a deposit, because they'll put immense pressure when you decide not to purchase, and no, this isn't the only dealer in town. Shop smart, not quick
