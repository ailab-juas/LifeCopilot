LPT: if youre thinking of hiring a contractor youre unfamiliar with to do a large job, hire them to do a small one first

content:
Just used a new contractor today who quoted me 100 bucks to install valves in 2 subpumps I have. Wanted the company to also do a full bathroom rebuild. The worker came in today and at the end of the day charged me more than 3x the quoted price. I said as much quite nicely and he started to swear and get belligerent.

I paid him and all other deals are off.

I can only imagine the financial mistake I would have made hiring this company to do a larger build.

Do yourselves a favor and learn this lesson for free that I paid 320 bucks for.
