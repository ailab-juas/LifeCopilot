title:
LPT: Whether you are working, or in your personal life, of anyone tells you they are going to sue you (or say they've talked to an attorney and will sue you), they are lying. Call their bluff and just say "in that case, this conversation is over and your attorney should contact my attorney".

content:
If they would have talked to an attorney, the very first thing they would have been told is "do not talk to the other party".

Of course, if you are actually served with a lawsuit, make sure you consult an attorney or at the very least, file your response within the specified time. And show up to any court date!
