title:
LPT: it’s not always correct to use “and I” instead of “and me”.

content:
You can tell what you should use by removing the second person. 

Correct Example: “John and I went to the shop.”
If you remove John, it reads “I went to the shop” which is correct. 

Incorrect Example: “The shop sent items to John and I.”
If you remove John, it reads “The shop sent items to I” which is incorrect as it should be “to me”.

Always do the check to make sure you’re using it correctly!
