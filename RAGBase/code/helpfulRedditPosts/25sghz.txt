YSK that when you're bored and want to do good in life, that you can spend a couple minutes talking to someone and save a life.

content:
One of the most personally rewarding things you can do when you have the thought "I'm bored" is to log onto reddit and check out some of the depression subreddits, like r/depression or r/suicidewatch. 

Just a few minutes of talking to someone could completely change their life, and you can be a complete stranger to do it. Just offer encouragement and personal experiences and try to comfort these people. 

Edit: The user u/SQLwitch has asked me to being this to your attention. Please read before making the trip to those subs..

&gt;&gt;  Just offer encouragement

&gt;I mod in both /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch and I have to say that this is a very dangerous recommendation.  What most people think of as "normal" encouragement can be tragically counter-productive.  Please edit your post and stress that before weighing in, in either sub, people should read the sidebars and in the case of SW, the talking tips that are linked from the sidebar!
