YSK that Comcast is currently testing data caps in some of their markets and that you can do something about it.

content:
1) Comcast has had a cap clauses in the fine print of residential services since they were caught sand vining almost decade ago.

2) It's not all areas, just test markets to gauge the backlash. You can see which specific areas are subject to cap penalties, [here.](http://customer.xfinity.com/help-and-support/internet/data-usage-trials-find-area)

3) It is imperative that people located in these areas, [file complaints with the FCC](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824) and contact the offices of [Liz Warren](http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=email_senator), [Bernie Sanders](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/services/casework/), and [Al Franken](https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=email_al), who are [working to open investigations into the cable-based ISPs](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/247497-sanders-warren-want-probe-on-ridiculous-cable-internet-prices) for using their monopolistic positions to extort unreasonable and unjustifiable fees from customers. 

Many thanks to /u/gnice3d for being the source of this info - It's important that as many people as possible know about this issue and contact the correct lines to lodge formal complaints.
