LPT: When planning an invite only party, make sure each guest knows at least one other person attending (not including you)

content:
A few times I've gone to a birthday party or celebration and I haven't known anyone else there except the host. It can be pretty awkward for someone like me who is really shy and doesnt feel comfortable in bigger crowds. The host is always really busy too greeting their guests and whatnot.

So while I'm planning my daughter's birthday I'm trying to make sure that each guest has at least one other friend that they didnt come with, just in case they get bored or feel awkward if they don't know anyone else. It means I might invite one or two acquaintances that I hadn't planned on inviting, and they may not even show up.. But I put the effort in at least. I don't know if this is common sense and my friends just haven't caught on.. but I thought I'd throw it out there!

As a result, your friends may enjoy your parties more and be more likely to come to following ones! And it may be easier for them to meet new people as well.. making it easier on you next time you invite them.

EDIT: this does not mean that if they don't know anybody then you shouldn't invite them. I don't know where everybody is getting that idea. It just means try to include one other friend that they know. If they don't know any of your other friends, invite them anyway. It's honestly just a guideline. Take it or leave it. Seriously.
