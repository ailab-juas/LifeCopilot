title:
LPT Always ask that friend who always says no to going out when planning something with friends.

content:
Wost case scenario, they'll probably say no, but it'll remind them that you do think and care about them. Not being told or informed makes them feel excluded or like you forgot about them, even if they were going to say no anyways. It's better to have the option to say no than to not have it at all. Best case scenario, they say yes and you get to hang out with your friend.


Edit: There are many different reasons why someone would say no all the time. I can't go through every single reason, relationships are complicated like that. Nor am I advocating for people to push friends away by always saying no. Relationships of any kind need effort from both sides. But it is really tempting to not ask someone because "they always say no". All it takes is one event they are not invited to to ruin a friendship. It does not take a lot of effort to shoot a text over to said friends because of all the reasons stated above.
