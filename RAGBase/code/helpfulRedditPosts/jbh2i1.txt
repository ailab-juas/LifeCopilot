LPT: When someone else gets angry, recognize that they are in a triggered state and won't be able to think or reason clearly, let alone truly hear you.

When we get angry, our nervous system can get hijacked into the sympathetic side of our autonomic nervous system. In the field of neuroscience, they call this sympathetic arousal. It's basically that feeling that comes online when we feel endangered or threatened. Suddenly, the amygdala in our brain sounds the alarm to our hypothalamus, which then activates our fight or flight response.

Imagine if you were walking through the woods and suddenly came across a bear or mountain lion. Your heart would start pumping faster, your pupils would dilate, and your breathing would become much more rapid. You would either be getting ready to fight or take flight as quickly as possible.

Fun fact, the brain can't distinguish between an emotional or physical threat. So remember, when we are experiencing anger, we are feeling threatened on some level and don't have full access to our higher executive functioning.

One quick way to avoid fighting and conflict is first to notice that you are hijacked and then give yourself a few moments to come back to yourself by taking a few deep breaths while making contact with your body. If you feel like you or someone else you are in connection with is on the verge of a fight, you can suggest taking a time-out to come back to yourselves and present moment experience before you re-engage.

We need to give our nervous systems the time they need to come back to homeostasis before we can healthfully come back into true connectedness.
