YSK- The 150 plus feet (45 meters) of space (and more) that truckers leave between themselves and another car on the highway is not for you to squeeze in between or use

Why YSK - 
It is called the “kill zone” and its supposed to act as a buffer zone between a car and the truck. Trucks when fully loaded (which is often) can take around two American football field lengths (600 feet or 182 meters) to slow to a complete stop even when applying full braking pressure. Leave that space alone. Use it ONLY briefly for immediate lane changes or briefly in emergency maneuvers, they need it to keep you safe

Edit: I’m not a trucker but I see many people complaining that truckers don’t always follow this rule. Ok great you noticed it, bad drivers come in all vehicles. The point is, do your best stay safe. Every situation is different but this is a general rule. 

You in your car, motorcycle, or SUV are gambling with your life, they aren’t. Call me crazy but I’d rather follow the rule that’s in the DMV drivers handbook than to play the blame game and lose my life and my ability to have an open casket funeral.
