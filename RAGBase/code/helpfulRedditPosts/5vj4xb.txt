**The short of it**:
Make a purchase $50 or more, sold by Amazon, no digital content, no video games, no gift cards and enter the code "BIGTHANKS" to save $8.63 today.

**The long of it**: Amazon just ranked #1 in the Harris Corporate Reputation Poll for the second year in a row. The survey  uses the opinions of more than 23k people in the US to determine a company's reputation - and Amazon got the highest score in 18 years. To thank customers, they've created a coupon code which saves you $8.63 - their rating was 86.27, so I guess it fits.

You can use the code once per customer and account, and it expires at 11:59PST today. You can't use it for digital content, video games, Amazon Gift Cards, or items not sold by Amazon.com. You also can't use it for orders placed through Alexa, Prime Now, Amazon Restaurants, or any mobile app other than the Amazon Shopping app. Items must be purchased in a single order and shipped at the same speed to a single address.

**The official of it**: [Here is Amazon's official statement.](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=15240005011)

**Why you should know this**: Most people purchase items on Amazon, and discounts that apply to this many items are hard to come by. If you purchase items that usually have the same value across stores (technology, household goods, etc) you could save money today.

**Why you should discuss this**: Reddit is a great platform for discussion, and with a sale like this there's going to be plenty of discussion about the best use for the discount. Let's post in the comments items that normally don't drop in price, have a consistent value among stores, and are generally usefu.
