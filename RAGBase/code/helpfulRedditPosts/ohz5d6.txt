LPT: As soon as you get a name for your baby, create an email address for her/him and share it with your family. They will be able to send messages and pictures. It's going to be the best present for your kid in a few years.

I did it for my 3 kids. They (and I) will have a blast going through it with them at one point in the future.

It's the best baby book possible.
