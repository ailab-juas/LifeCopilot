LPT: Just because you got paid, doesn’t mean you have to spend it. It’s important to remember needs vs wants.

content:
Most people get paid on Friday, whether it’s weekly or biweekly, and automatically think “I just got paid today” to justify themselves to make a purchase. Keep in mind what you need vs what you want. It never hurts to spend a little of you’re hard earned money on yourself every once in a while but most people get careless with spending.
