LPT: If you need to ask someone for a favour, but also want to have a chat with them and ask how they're going, always ask about the favour first!

content:
Something my mum taught me. If you need to ask someone for a favour or to do a task (like cover a shift, drive you somewhere), but you also want to chat and ask them how they're going; always start with the favour first!

Doing it in this order makes them feel like you're not just after their help and you genuinely care about how they're doing. Which of course you do! 

However If you go about it the other way, you might have a great conversation, but all of that will just be viewed as 'buttering you up' once you eventually ask them for that favour at the end. And you'll probably get the good old 'ohhhh so that's what you actually wanted.'
