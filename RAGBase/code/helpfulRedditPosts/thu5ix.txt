LPT: Physical Therapy isn’t just for people who need to learn to walk again, it can help people with acute or chronic pain, balance and vertigo, headaches, concussion, jaw pain, incontinence, pain with sex, neurological disorders, or any physical problems limiting you from doing what you want to do.

content:
A lot of people don’t fully understand what physical therapy (and speech and occupational therapy) can do for them.  Our goal is to get you out of our clinic as soon as possible so your condition has either resolved completely and/or you now have the tools to manage it well without us!

Edit: Also, to the people with long-Covid who still feel really fatigued and out of breath with your activities—come see us! We can help!

Edit 2: based on a comment I want to add the following info: some of the areas we treat require seeing a PT who specializes in that area. A regular PT should know if you need to see another PT with certain certifications or a specialization. For example, I would suggest that the long-Covid patients see rehab specialists who advertise working specifically with that population, since research in that area is new and evolving.
