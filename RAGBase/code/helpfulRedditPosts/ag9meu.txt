YSK there are a large number of CBD brands out there selling unsafe product with heavy metals and other toxins.

With the rise in popularity of CBD products, I feel it's important to educate as many people as possible about product safety.  CBD has changed my life.  I want to see it widely available and inexpensive to others like me well into the future.

There have been some issues with unethical companies in the space, here just for the 'green rush'.  Let's talk about what's happened and how you and your friends/family can avoid consuming any dangerous products.

For one, the FDA released several open complaints against CBD producers over the course of 2015, 2016, and 2017.  These complaints mostly pertained to the complete lack of CBD in the brands' products, or simply not as much as the brand advertised.  Some complaints referenced noncompliant claims in the brands' advertising.  Read here: https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm484109.htm

It gets worse.  A user complained that their vape liquid from Diamond CBD, a well-known brand in the space, got them really, really high.  Further testing found synthetic marijuana (K2 or Spice) in the product, as well as cough syrup.

[Lastly from me, ProVerde Labs, a top lab in the space, recently sent out this warning letter to suppliers.  It speaks for itself.](https://i.imgur.com/i6CaU4u.png)

Please, friends, if you are going to try CBD, buy it from a brand that publishes clean lab results openly and transparently.
