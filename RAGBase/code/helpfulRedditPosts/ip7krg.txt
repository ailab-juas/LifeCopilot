YSK: NASA has been uploading daily Astronomy pictures since 1995

content:
Why YSK: Currently, a huge percentage of people in the world dont truly understand how beautiful space is with it's vast beauties, and I want to expose this rather unkown archive with over 6000 images and diagrams taken from outer space. In addition, all of these images are usable without copyright because NASA is a public funded company.
