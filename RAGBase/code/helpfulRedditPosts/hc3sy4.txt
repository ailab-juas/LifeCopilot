LPT: After going through a breakup don’t snoop your ex’s social media. At best you’ll see something you don’t care about, at worst you’ll see something that breaks your heart.

The key is to “move on” and constantly checking in to their life keeps you static. You won’t move forward with your own life if you’re constantly tethered to theirs. It’s ok to miss them, and long for them, but you have to keep moving. Snooping is something we can truly control, and after a week or two you will be proud of yourself for not giving in.
