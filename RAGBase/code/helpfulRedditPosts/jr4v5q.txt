LPT: use Ctrl + shift + V (paste without formattting instead of Ctrl + V (paste) to save time

content:
Ctrl + shift + V (paste without formatting) keeps the text font/colour/size the same as the rest of the text. So essentially you don't have to change the text font, colour and size after pasting text. 

This has saved me loads of time and effort.

Edit: as people have been saying in the comments, unfortunately this doesn't work on every program.

Also, on mac, the command is option + command + shift + V.
