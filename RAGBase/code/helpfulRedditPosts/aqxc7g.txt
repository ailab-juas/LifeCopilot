YSK: You can permanently close the right pane when you open a PDF using Adobe Reader DC

content:
1. Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Documents, and then select Remember current state of Tools pane.

2. Open a PDF document in Reader DC, and then collapse the Tools pane. Click OK. Relaunch Acrobat Reader DC.

3. Voila! Acrobat Reader now remembers the state of your Tools pane. 
If it was collapsed (or expanded) during the last launch, it remains collapsed (or expanded) when you launch again.

Edit: I've never received so much love from reddit (and close to Valentine's at that)! I love you too!!

And OMG my first gold! Thanks stranger!
