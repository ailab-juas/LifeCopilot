title:
LPT before spreading potential gossip, see if it passes the "3 sieves test"

content:
The first "sieve" is truth: do you know it is true.

The second is kindness: is this a nice thing to say about someone/thing.

The third is utility: is this information beneficial or useful to the person being told to or about.

If it doesn't pass through these then it is best not to say it, and move on with your day.
