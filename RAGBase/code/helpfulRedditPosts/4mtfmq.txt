YSK about the Dunning–Kruger effect, and how people who are very bad at something think they are actually pretty good.

Has it ever seemed to you that less competent people rate their competence higher than it actually is? It’s not just your imagination. 
It's is a genuine cognitive bias called the Dunning-Kruger Effect.

The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which relatively unskilled persons suffer illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is. Dunning and Kruger attributed this bias to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their own ineptitude and evaluate their own ability accurately.
