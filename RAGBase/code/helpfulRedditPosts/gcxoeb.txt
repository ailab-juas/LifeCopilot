title:
YSK that just because autistic people are bad at social interaction, they have the same range of emotions as every other person, if not even more complex.

This is a common stereotype, that autistic people are apathic, or kind of a sociopath. That is a myth that isn‘t true. In reality, autistic people - who aren’t coincidentally sociopaths as well - feel the same empathy as everyone else. As someone with autism I can say I seem to get easily emotional over simple things such as when when someone is smiling. My feelings are complex to understand, but quite simple to get out of me. I‘m very sensitive, I‘m not „a robot“, not „apathic“ and not unemotional just because I have autism. It‘s just a common misconception. I have a friend who also has autism and she’s always super nice to me. She always cares for me and everyone, she is very hard-working and very supportive just to make everyone happy. She’s non-verbal, which means she doesn’t like to speak to communicate but that doesn’t stop me from admiring her a lot. Oh, and we‘re not always good at maths or physics. It‘s actually my worst subject. I hate to do science in school, I always liked languages more.
