YSK homeopathy does not work at all and is quackery

content:
Homeopathic remedies have been evaluated scientifically numerous times, including in meta analysis and highly regulated experiments. Every time, homeopathy has been shown to be PLACEBO, and nothing more. Homeopaths create these “remedies” and believe they are stronger the more dilute they are, yet these bogus remedies are so dilute that there is less than one molecule of “active ingredient” in many of the bottles sold. Essentially, homeopaths cheat naive individuals by selling them nothing more than water. Even the plants and such from which the solutions are made have been shown to not be based in science (many homeopaths will make different remedies for the same patient, as there is no standardization because there is no real scientific basis).

This is dangerous not only because it propagates lies and cheats ill individuals, but it also gives sick patients a sense of false security. Patients need to be educated about quackery in medicine so they can receive real, evidence-based medical treatment from licensed physicians (NOT naturopathic “doctors)
