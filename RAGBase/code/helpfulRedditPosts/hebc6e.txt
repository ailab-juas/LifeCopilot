title:
YSK that lack of eye contact does not mean that a person is being rude. Autism, ADHD, PTSD and social anxiety can all make it difficult to look someone in the eye.

content:
If people with these conditions force themselves to make eye contact they will often find it so distracting they won't be able to focus on what you are saying.

Also there are many cultures, including Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Native American, where eye contact can be considered disrespectful. For example, Japanese children are taught to look at others' necks to avoid making direct eye contact.

Consider that not all behaviors considered "rude" are intended to be, or even universally considered rude. This is especially important to remember if you are a parent, teacher, boss, or other authority figure.

Edit: Would also like to add people with eye and hearing problems too!
