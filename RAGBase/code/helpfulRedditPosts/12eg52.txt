LPT: Switch to bamboo pillowcases/sheets if you like cooler temperatures (colder pillowcases!) Bamboo blends are a more breathable resulting in 2-3 degrees colder than other sheets.

My boyfriend would always rave about how much he liked the cold side of the bed (and would often take the cool parts I didn't get to yet when we cuddled in bed together).  I looked into new bedsheets and found out that bamboo blends (rayon from bamboo) are more breathable and wicks away moisture allowing for a cooler feel.

Bought them for him and he absolutely loves them. Keeps his pillowcase nice and cool too, moreso than the pillowcases he had before.

Definitely would recommend if you are a fan of cold bedsheets and/or you suffer from hotflashes when sleeping.
