title:
YSK that mental illness is a hinderance to ability just as physical illnesses are.

content:

Why YSK this: Because ignorance on mental health feeds into the stigma and worsens the level of care those with mental illness often receive.

If someone with depression says they can’t brush their hair, you’ve got to treat it like someone without limbs says they can’t brush their hair. Just because you cant see the disability doesn’t mean it isn’t there. If someone with anxiety says they cannot talk to someone without assistance, you’ve got to treat it like someone who is mute needs a translator. If someone with OCD says they can’t leave the house, you’ve got to treat it like someone with an autoimmune disease. Or whatever comparison it takes to understand that the hinderances caused by mental illnesses are the same as hinderances caused by physical disabilities!!! It’s not just we ‘just don’t want to’. Of course I want to shower and go out with my friends or do the jobs that need to be done. I’m not lazy for not being able to. I just can’t do it without extra help. Please understand this.
