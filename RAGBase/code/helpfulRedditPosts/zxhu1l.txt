LPT: If you work an office job, save your time off for non-holiday seasons

content:
During Christmas, for example, most people use their PTO. Therefore, the flow of work is slow, and it can feel like a holiday anyway. If possible, take time off when most of your peers will not be taking time off. 

(I learned this lesson too late in my career. Instead of wondering why I feel burned out after the holidays when everyone is back in the office, I take time away after the holidays instead.)
