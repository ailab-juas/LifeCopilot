LPT: If someone you know is going through a rough time, try to be specific and proactive in your offers to help them. People undergoing hardship often feel like asking for help and delegating tasks just another overwhelming task on their plate.

Having gone through tough times (losing a parent to cancer among other things) one of the least useful phrases I encountered was “If you need anything, let me know / don’t hesitate to ask.” 

However, the best sources of support were from those who were responsive and took initiative for things they knew I may need help with. 

For example: “Do you need help sorting through household items (of deceased parent) to donate? Can I take those things to Goodwill for you?” or “What are you doing for groceries / dinner this week? What can I make or get for you?” These efforts make a tremendous difference.
