LPT Good way to recover a stolen vehicle

content:
If you've ever had a vehicle stolen, you may not feel like you have any recourse. This isn't true. Go down to your local garbage company's truck yard at about 5am and hand out flyers to the drivers with information about your car. Offer $50 or a case of beer and chances are that we (garbagemen) will find it. We cover every street and alley several times per week and are generally pretty aware of our surroundings.

I had my stolen motorcycle recovered within a week, and another driver recovered a different stolen bike about a year later.
