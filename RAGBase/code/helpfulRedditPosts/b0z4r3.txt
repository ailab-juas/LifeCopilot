LPT: When you apply for job, save the details of the vacancy for later. Most employees take it offline once they invited some candidates.

This mistake is easily done! When you get invited and want to prepare for the interview, it could happen that the specifications are already taken offline.
Better save the informations directly beside your application documents.
