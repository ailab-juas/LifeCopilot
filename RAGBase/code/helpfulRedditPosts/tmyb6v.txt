LPT: Hobbies and active interests are absolutely necessary for a happy, fulfilling life.

content:
I know too many people that don't seem to have one of either, and their lives appear to suffer for it.  The average person's hobby is "Netflix". Netflix is not a hobby.  GET A HOBBY.  Better yet, get a bunch of them and jump back and forth between them.  It can be anything... collect driftwood, get into bicycling, learn how to program, read books, birdwatch... anything.  You'll be better for it.
