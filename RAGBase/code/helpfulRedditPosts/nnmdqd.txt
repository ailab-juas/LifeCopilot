LPT: You don't save money buying items that are on sale if you weren't planning on buying them for their original price

content:
You waste money buying items that you wouldn't have bought/cared about normally, thus, you are still wasting money on items you don't need even if they are on sale. 

Don't fall into marketing tactics and buy items just because they are on sale if you weren't planning on already buying the item before it was on sale. You'll save money and feel better.
