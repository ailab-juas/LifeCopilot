title:
LPT Don’t hang out with constant complainers.

content:
Don’t spend time with—or date/marry—people who seem to constantly complain about things. It’s tempting to say, “We’ll, they just don’t like X. But they’ll stop complaining when they [move, graduate, get a new job, buy a new house].” No, they won’t. Perpetual negativity is a personality trait. They will always find something to complain upset about, regardless of their surroundings or material well-being.
