YSK: If your items in your refrigerator are starting to freeze, it may be time to clean the back/underside of it.

content:
At least twice a year I will start to notice items in my refrigerator starting to freeze.  This has been going on for as long as I owned it over 10+ years.  It is by no means a newer expensive model but it's all I have an no room in the budget to replace it.  

We have a lot of pets so it gets dirty fast.  If you are able to get inside the back behind any panels with a vacuum nozzle then have at it but most of the inner workings are very tight and compressed air although messy, will get the job done.  

Hope this helps!

***EDIT: Since a lot of my the comments are telling me to turn it down as if I didn't know this is an option, yes, this is even with it turned all the way down.***
