LPT: learn to pick your battles, especially while you’re young

content:
It’s so easy and feels very noble to be passionate about things such as human rights and the protection of others, but there are so many people, specifically strangers on the internet, who have no interest in changing their minds. 
 
Im specifically referencing a video hot on r/therewasanattempt of a young (presumably) girl going off on a young man who just isn’t taking it. I don’t think they deserve the sheer ridicule they’re getting, as they’re addressing something that is indeed a problem on the internet. however, because of their inability to read the situation and know that it was fruitless, they’re being roasted to hell on reddit.

Learning to hold your tongue not only can save you from embarrassing yourself, but also saves a lot of energy. by not engaging those who don’t want to listen, the amount of possibly successful conversations can be much higher. along with picking your battles, know your audience.

I know it’s the internet and young people making mistakes and being foolish will always be entertainment to some, but lessons like these really can stop mental heath crises by helping dodge bullying situations. 

stay private, my friends.

edit: these situations could also be stopped by teaching bullies not to bully, but i don’t know how to do that so I’m picking my battle for those who want to stay out of it all.
