LPT: Your kids WILL do what you do. Think of everything you do now as your kids doing it as well. Learn new skills, engage in new activities and develop good habits now. If you have bad habits, your kids will pick them up and stopping them now is also preventing your kids from developing them.

let us all know some good habits you have, so that maybe others can lead by your example :)

Saw this in a friend who picked up skateboarding later in life and thought it was pointless that he even tried. His kid is now a real good skateboarder and may not have ever picked it up if he didn't learn later in life.
