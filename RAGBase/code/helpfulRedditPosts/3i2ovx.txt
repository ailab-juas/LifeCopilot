title:
LPT: Donâ€™t small talk with people when you're asking them for help. It shows that you only care when you need something from them. Be honest and get straight to the point.

content:
Proceed with small talk with them AFTER they've helped you, it'll show that you weren't just interested in the favour. They'll appreciate your honesty and will probably like you more.

**Edit:** Wow!! I really didn't expect this to make front page! Thanks for all the up-votes guys!
