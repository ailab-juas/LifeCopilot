LPT: Get cotton items extra white by using vinegar

content:
When cleaning white cotton items like socks, shirts, sheets and washcloths use white distilled vinegar to get all the stains out. Add 1 cup of vinegar to a large pot of water and heat to boiling. Add the articles, let soak overnight and then launder as usual. This will also remove any odors such as mildew.
