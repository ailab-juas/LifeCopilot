LPT - When calling emergency services, you can request the responders to roll up on the scene with their lights/sirens off.

I have requested them to come in "dark" as to not escalate the situation.  Every time, the operator transmitted my request, and the responders respected it. And it helped.

Edit:  The real tips are in the comments.  **"Be informed and Speak  out in a crisis."**  might be the real tip.
    I woke up to this.    I appreciate everyone being so civil &amp; sharing tips
