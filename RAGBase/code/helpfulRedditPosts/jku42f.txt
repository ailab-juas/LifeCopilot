Why YSK: With “I’m Feeling Lucky,” users will be taken somewhere among tens of thousands of notable tourist spots only with the click of a button by Google Earth. After having arrived at a point of interest, you can also open a Knowledge Card to learn more about the history and facts of that place and have a look at some of the pictures. Just discovered this feature and I am more than ecstatic to share it with you guys!
