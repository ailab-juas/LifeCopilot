title:
YSK that laughing at your kid when they're crying or in pain because you think it's stupid or funny, especially when they're old enough to understand, might lead to a traumatizing experience for them.

content:
The child will most likely always remember you laughing or mocking their emotions when they were clearly in pain. Even if YOU think they're crying because of something stupid. Don't laugh at them.
