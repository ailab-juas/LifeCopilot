LPT: Flour is highly flammable.

content:
Every now and again we see individuals joking around by throwing flour at people during birthdays and other events.

Flour is highly flammable when in a dust cloud. Any contact with an open flame or hot enough source will cause a dangerous flame.

Don't throw flour for fun!
