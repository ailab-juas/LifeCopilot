LPT [Request] Doing a Eurotrip - What are your pro tips for a problem-free adventure?

content:
Feel free to post any advice you have. 

Specifically, I'm going on my first multi-country trip and am concerned that I'm forgetting something vital. I fly in to Italy (Australia -&gt; China -&gt; Italy) and out of France (France -&gt; China -&gt; Australia), traveling through Austria, Czech Republic, and Germany via train. Flights are booked and accommodation is being sorted out, but what else do I need to consider? 

Never done anything like this before, so I have no idea what to take care of beforehand and what should be done on the spot.

Visas, train tickets, tourist attractions, luggage, tourist attractions, etc. - What's the smart way to do it? Also if you know of something I absolutely must do, I'd be happy to hear it. 

Thanks!
