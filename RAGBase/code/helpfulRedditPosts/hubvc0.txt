title:
YSK that if you find a dead body in the snow/retrieved from falling through ice, that they are not dead until they are dead and warm

content:
(VT student but this also applies to human medicine as well) Whether you found them outside or just watched them get pulled out of icy water, it is important that you get them to a warm dry place and remove any wet clothing, and continue resuscitation attempts until medical personnel arrive. You'd be surprised at how dead hypothermia victims look while still being in the zone where recovery is possible. Just remember, a hypothermia victim is not dead until they are warm and dead.
