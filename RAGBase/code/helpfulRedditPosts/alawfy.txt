LPT - you don't realize how much you miss your hearing until it's gone. When engaging in anything that involves a lot of noise (concerts, festivals, gun range, etc.) make sure you use earplugs. Tinnitus is just the beginning of a nightmare.

I work at a music venue, and have for a long time. My hearing isn't near as good as it used to be, and the tinnitus is just a reminder that I need to make sure I use earplugs. Spend the money on some good ones. Your ears will thank you.

**Edit:** well, who knew this was going to blow up?  :). RIP to my inbox for sure.

A few things about myself: I'm 44 years old, and have been working in and around music since I was 8. My tinnitus started in high school band. I was a tuba player, and being around all the brass instruments definitely played a part in it. Also I was playing in a punk band, and neither activities did I use ear protection. I've been living with tinnitus for over 25 years, although for the last 15 or so, I've coddled my ears, because I'm afraid to do any more damage to them. The ringing is constant, and sometimes, even with noise in the background, the ringing is so loud I can't focus. It's horrible, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

It doesn't take much. Sustained noise at 85db is enough to cause damage. Heavy traffic is often louder than this.

You *do not* want to be deaf. Protect your ears.

Edit: Thanks for the silver kind stranger!
