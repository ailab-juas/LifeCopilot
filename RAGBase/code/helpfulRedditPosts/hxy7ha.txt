LPT: if you're a redditor, for a happier day, follow positive subs like aww, GetMotivated, HumanBeingBros, MadeMeSmile, and unfollow negative subs like PublicFreakout, RelationshipAdvice, JusticeServed, any Karen type of sub, or sub with violent content.

content:
Believe me this is a big change.

Looking at those Karen subs made me concerned about any American White woman I saw on the internet. PublicFreakout is nowadays filled only with violence from the roads. You unfollow them and look the positive subs.

Cops helping a baby who's just about to die, a small kid donating her restaurant food to homeless and her dad being proud of it, people motivating each other to fight depression - these are the things you should have more in your life.

PS - You can still be active about protests like BLM without following PublicFreakout. Just read the newspapers. Or maybe one video once in a while to be aware.

Bonus tip: Unfollow people who always spew hate on Twitter. Follow what people who are artists or experts in the field you like. I unfollowed political activists and followed tech experts. I can happily look at my Twitter feed now.

Edit: Two awards. Damn! Thank you people. I guess spreading happiness gives you happiness.
Edit 2: Removed GetMotivated. It never helped me but I thought it helped others. But a lot of backlash here.
