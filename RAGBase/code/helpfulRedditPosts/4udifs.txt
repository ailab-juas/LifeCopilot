LPT: Showing someone 'reflective appreciation' for something they did for you earlier that day means more them than it did when you said 'thank you' as it happened.

content:
E.g. If a friend gives you a ride home, I am sure you say 'thank you' as you leave the car. Before you go to bed that night send them a message telling them how much you appreciate what they did and how thankful you were for it.

Everytime you said 'thank you' to a friend, you should show them 'reflective appreciation' later.

EDIT UPDATE : Wooow. I had no idea this would get so many upvotes and comments. Despite the fact I missed out words and had several typos on my post I am glad to see that so many people have taken from it what I intended. 

A key phrase is 'catch them doing it right'. Let's be positive and show appreciation and love.
