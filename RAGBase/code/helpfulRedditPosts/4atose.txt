LPT: If your dog is addicted to tennis balls, call a local racquet club and ask if they sell their used balls. Yesterday my local club gave me over 100 for free!

content:
I took 40 of them to the local dog park. Not a single one left today when I went, which means some dogs had a good time!

EDIT: Yes, tennis balls can be bad for your dogs teeth. If you don't want to use them, fine. Those that do, it is indeed smart not to let them have free reign with them. But doesn't this go with everything we give our dogs? So use your own common sense and your own judgement and give your dog what you want. Just spoil the dogs, that's what is important.
