LPT: Have an annoying fly you just can't swat? Work smarter not harder. Use a spray bottle filled with liquid instead. This gets their wings wet so they can't fly. Let them crash &amp; swat at your leisure.

Everytime I've done this with someone around, they tell me they've never used this method. I've never gone without success for more than a minute using the spray bottle. I hope this helps anyone frustrated by unsuccessful swatting .
