YSK that if you have someone in your household that takes care of most of the Holiday shopping, and you have stockings make sure that person has stocking stuffers.

 WHY YSK: Stocking stuffers are often something you forget about until the moment happens. In some cases, the primary holiday planner will buy something for themselves to go in the stocking or just completely forget about it all together. If this is your household than maybe something small and simple could brighten up their day. I'll leave a few ideas below that may help or spark another idea for you. Happy holidays everyone!

Small gift ideas: Nail manicure kit, gift card to favorite restaurant/ store/ game, ChapStick /lip balm, face lotion/ beard oil, stress ball/ fidget toy, signed note from family, pictures drawn by children, Pet art (foot/paw print on paper), bath bombs, favorite candy, car air freshener.
