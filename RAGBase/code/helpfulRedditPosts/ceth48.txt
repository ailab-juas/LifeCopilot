LPT: Get a cheap dashcam and set it up in your car. Even if it is not working just having it will force people to tell the truth.

content:
My dashcam of 2 years stopped working a few months ago and I never got around to getting a new one.  Well someone backed into me and I felt a pit in my stomach when the person actually tried to blame it on me.  I knew my dashcam wasn't working but after he made a few comments I pointed to it and said, "You better start telling the truth when the cop gets here because I have a dashcam that shows the truth."  You could see the shock and horror in his face when I told him this and he told the cops the truth when they got there.
