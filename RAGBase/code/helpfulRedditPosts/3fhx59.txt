*How does this game work?*

JohnnyAppl is a trivia game that lets you plant real trees by getting questions right. Everyone plays together to crowd-fund reforestation projects in Madagascar, Ethiopia, and Haiti. For every correct answer, a micro-donation is automatically sent to one of these planting sites. These micro-donations are paid for by banner ads. When you plant trees, you also offset CO2, so we track how this offsetting makes you carbon neutral.


*Will planting a tree really fight off climate change?*

Yes, trees fight climate change. We know that CO2 (carbon dioxide) is a major contributor to global warming. Trees suck CO2 out of the air and store it in their trunks and roots, acting as carbon-sinks. A recent study by NASA suggests that tropical forests [may help end climate change](http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/nasa-finds-good-news-on-forests-and-carbon-dioxide/#.VKY_nIfFut8). When you plant trees, the CO2 your trees offset can make you carbon neutral. Staying carbon neutral is a great way to take responsibility for your impact on climate change. 


*Is there any proof the trees are really planted?*

Yes. Our partner [Eden Reforestation Projects](http://www.edenprojects.org/) is one of the largest and most successful reforestation groups. They have already planted over 60 million trees in [Madagascar](http://www.edenprojects.org/madagascar). They are a verified, non-profit, 501(c)(3) charitable organization. To see more information on where your trees are planted, visit [Madagascar](http://www.edenprojects.org/madagascar), [Ethiopia,](http://www.edenprojects.org/ethiopia) or [Haiti](http://www.edenprojects.org/haiti) on Edenâ€™s website. They often update us with new photos and videos on their [blog](http://www.edenprojects.org/blog). 


*Who pay for the trees, and who plants them?*

100% of revenue is generated from advertisements. There is a banner ad on the right-side of the game screen that pays for all the trees. This money is sent directly to our reforestation partners - [Eden Reforestation Projects](http://www.edenprojects.org/). Eden restores hope, alleviates suffering, empowers people and builds local economies in impoverished communities. Local workers benefit immensely from the jobs created by the trees you plant on JohnnyAppl.
