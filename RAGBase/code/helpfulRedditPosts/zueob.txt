LPT: Getting rid of flies en masse, in less than an hour

content:
I see a lot of tips here on fly traps and fruit fly traps, which are pretty effective.  However, they do take some time to complete work.

**Boil vinegar.**

A few weeks ago over at a friend's house, I was cooking dinner.  Part of it was a Balsamic reduction, which I needed a lot of (many people).  We'd had the windows and doors of the house open all day because it was warm, and there were probably 10-15 flies meandering around the down stairs as well as the upstairs.

As soon as the vinegar fumes hit the air, they starting dropping out of the sky like they'd been sprayed by raid.  They weren't stunned, they were dead.  As the fumes spread, the ones upstairs died too.

Today, I came home from work to find a small cloud of horse flies in my living room (probably about 10 of them, but those assholes are huge).  I opened the back door to see if they'd go OUT, but more came IN.  My neighbor's garbage was apparently infested.

I figured I was having pasta and beef for dinner anyway, so I'd see if the vinegar worked again.  I started simmering some Balsamic... and lo and behold, they all died within 10 minutes.  I swept them out the door.

Yes, your house is going to smell like vinegar for a few hours, but that's easily aired out.

**TL;DR Simmer or boil vinegar on your stove.  The fumes will kill flies almost immediately.**

***WARNING: STRONG VINEGAR FUMES CAN HARM SMALL MAMMALS AND ESPECIALLY BIRDS.  PLEASE TAKE CARE WITH YOUR SMALL PETS.***

Edited to add (05/13): Comptp35 just messaged me with this, so obviously at your own risk:

&gt;Apparently this thread no longer accepts comments, but I wanted to give you some feedback on your LPT. I unfortunately didn't have the same luck. Either it doesn't work too well across the board, or I have a plague of mutant NYC flies. I boiled a whole bottle of vinegar, and all that happened was my roommate and I had burning eyes, and the flies were more active in their aerial acrobatics :/
