LPT: Don't minimize the value of being a social initiator. It feels great when people ask you to make plans, but it doesn't mean they don't really want to see you if they aren't asking. Many adult friendships dwindle or never take off as people rely on others to initiate without doing it themselves.

Friendships in the adult world often take a lot more effort than back when we were in school.

This is particularly true as people settle into their partnerships, get busy with work, and start to have kids. If you are less busy with any of these things than your friends, you will likely need to be the initiator with them. Even if you are just as busy or more so, it might still fall to you if you are better at prioritizing your friends or organizing your time.

However busy or lacking in social energy someone might be, it doesn't mean they don't want to hear from you and see you.
