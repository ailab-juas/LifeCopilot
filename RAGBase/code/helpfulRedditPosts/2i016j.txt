LPT: Cover food with a wet paper towel when reheating in a microwave.

content:
Your microwave will stay much cleaner, your food won't be dried out and will heat more evenly. This also works for cooking whole~~baked~~ potatoes in a pinch too. Wrap raw potato in a wet paper towel and microwave for 2-5 minutes per potato...not quite the same as from the oven but, it beats waiting an hour for them to cook.

edit:  Forgot to mention the toothpicks....if you have something like a sauce or cheese on top of the dish you're trying to reheat, break a few toothpicks in half and prop up the wet paper towel to prevent it from taking the goods with it.
