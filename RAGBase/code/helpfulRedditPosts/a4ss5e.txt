[LPT] After witnessing/being involved in a traffic accident or crime, make a voice note of what you saw, heard, and felt before speaking with anyone. Your memory of the incident will change drastically with each encounter, and the notes you make will stand up in a court as more viable evidence than

went to bed. Sorry, y'all! (east-coaster here)

... also to everyone mentioning photos. Yes, do this. 
I was rear-ended on my bike by an 87 year old man in a Buick, who said I "came out of nowhere," which to the world sounds like an ass-hole cyclist who swerved in front of a car. That wasn't the case. I had been waiting to turn left, so was in the left lane (which becomes a turn lane for a more prominent intersection up the road). I was waiting for a minute or two, waiting for oncoming traffic to cease when along he came, on his way home, driving in auto-pilot, neglecting to see a bike that isn't on his radar to notice. There were 6 witnesses who all said that I had been waiting, and was there long before he was. The one witness who saved my ass left a voice note on his phone detailing everything he witnessed, that I had been waiting. That he expected the car to stop, To swerve. I got unlucky. This witness was the only one who had a clear view of the incident, and in his voice note, you can hear the sirens from the ambulance and police. 

They thought I'd died, sent me to the hospital, and charged the old geezer with following too closely. 

I saw him in court, after everything was said and done, and he never once apologized.

Update: I get it, get a dash cam. I was hit while on a bike. I was rear-ended. The person who left the voice note was on a bike across the street. Sure, the driver should have had a dash cam. Tell him that.
