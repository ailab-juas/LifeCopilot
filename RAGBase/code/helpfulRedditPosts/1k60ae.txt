EDIT: A few users below have started a referral train... consider joining them, and share some of that yummy storage. :) :) :)  

EDIT 2: okay guys seriously!!! Join the referral train!!!! :D

EDIT 3: okay people... I have more than 500 GB of cloud storage now. Seriously, help out the people in the referral train.

EDIT 4: guys, it's been brought to my attention that posting a referral link will let people see your full name that you enter into copy. Please use an alias!

**EDIT 5: I'm now posting random referral links in the original post to help out some of my fellow redditors!** :)
