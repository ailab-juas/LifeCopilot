title:
Eliminate the prickliness of freshly-trimmed armpit hair (or other body hair) by using conditioner.

content:
I'd never thought of this before, but recently I trimmed my armpit hair nearly all the way down, and it was really prickly/scratchy/annoying. I ended up putting conditioner on it and leaving it on for a while before rinsing, and the hairs weren't nearly as sharp!

Also works for people with prickly beards or after a good "man-scaping" if you catch my drift.
