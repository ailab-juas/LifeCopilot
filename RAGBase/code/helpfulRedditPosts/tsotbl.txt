LPT: Finding a Public Restroom in a City

content:
Have a hard time finding a restroom while in a city? 

Walk into a hotel lobby like you know where you’re going and go to the restroom. 

If you can’t find it quickly, find an employee and say “ I need to use the restroom really quick, but don’t want to go all the way to my room. Can you point me to the lobby restroom?” 

As long as they have one and you don’t look homeless, it will work nearly every time. 

I’ve used this all over the US and Canada in many, major large cities.




Edit 1: As many have pointed out, the first option is to just walk in and go straight to the restroom like you own the place. Being confident and acting like you belong somewhere will get you into a lot of places you otherwise wouldn’t. The example I gave has variations to it and there have been some solid ones mentioned in the comments. You can typically read the hotel employee pretty quick and get a sense if you can just ask or if you’re going to have to get a bit more creative to get access. 

Edit 2: Thanks for all of the awards kind strangers! Of all things, it blows my mind that this is the post that gets me on the front page for the first time. 

Edit 3: Some have pointed out that this likely works well for me because I’m white and that is a very valid point. I’m definitely aware of my white male privilege and it sucks that that is still a thing in 2022. We still have a lot of work to do. 

Edit 4: It’s cool to hear that some countries like India have made access to public restrooms and clear drinking water a basic right afforded to everyone. We’re behind on some of this stuff here in the US.
