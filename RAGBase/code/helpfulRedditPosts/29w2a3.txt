LPT: How to pick a good, store bought bottle of wine

content:
Know nothing about wine but don't want to bring a bad one to dinner? These two simple checks have always done me well. 

1) **Check if its produced and bottled in the same place** 

If a vineyard is truly proud of the wine it produces they will tend to bottle it themselves.

2) **Check the indent at the bottom of the bottle** 

Often the deeper the indent the better the wine. Steer away from bottles with a completely flat bottom.
