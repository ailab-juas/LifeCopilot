LPT: Don't just talk to kids about fire safety, have them explain to you what they'd do in an emergency, so you know what you need to explain further.

My son has anxiety. I realized that if he had to exit his bedroom in an emergency, he might be afraid to break a window in order to leave, thinking I'd be mad if he broke a lamp to break a window. I sat in his bedroom, as it was, and asked him to name things he could use to break a window, if needed, and I promised him that I absolutely would not punish or be angry if he broke anything in order to exit in an emergency. Adults tend to be fast acting in emergencies, but we have to reinforce with children the best thing to do because they often freeze up or fear repercussion. Don't just tell children what to do in an emergency, ask them about different scenarios that could occur.
