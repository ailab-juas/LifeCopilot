LPT If you're someone's boss don't debate politics with them. It isn't an even playing field. They can't defeat you without consequences. Odds are, if you felt like you "won" a debate with an employee you came across like a massive tool.

When you're someone's boss you can't afford to forget that you are holding someone's livelihoods over their heads. They may laugh harder at your jokes or take your opinions more seriously than they merit, but if you let that go to your head and start thinking you're smarter and more clever than you are, your employee may start to resent you. And God help you if you ever start thinking it's a good idea to debate politics or religion with your employees. You could offend them all day long. You could cross the line and attack them personally and there might not be much they could do about it. But they know all they have to do is slip up slightly in these "debates" and suddenly they don't hold any favor with you. They get passed up for promotion or they are the first on the chopping block when it's time to lay someone off. If you really want to see how smart you are and how well you've developed your arguments, save it for your friends. Just don't be surprised when they easily dismantle your opinions.
