YSK That if you can't afford to bury or cremate a loved one, there are services that will do it for free.

In the past year I've lost both of my parents to cancer. They weren't well off financially and neither were my sister or myself. We knew we couldn't afford to bury them and cremation was even a bit pricy for us. Thankfully the hospice nurse made us aware of [Life Legacy](http://www.lifelegacy.org/).

If you donate the body to science Life Legacy will cremate and return the remains to you for free after a few weeks. There are some awkward question when you call them, but generally it was a simple procedure to donate. 

I am beyond grateful to this company for helping me and my sister.
