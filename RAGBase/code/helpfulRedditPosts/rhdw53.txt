LPT: Open your kids Christmas presents and undo all the annoying packaging before you wrap them. It will save you so much time and frustration on Christmas day.

content:
I have been doing this for years; untwirl to sandwich ties, cut the tape, snap the plastic tag holders off. Your child can now open their gift and then immediately or with little effort get their toy out to enjoy it. If there are pieces or it will rattle too loosely under the wrapping, you can always re-secure some things with some scotch tape

Edited to mention you can use common sense and only remove some of the annoying doo-dads to make it less frustrating later but still hold things in place, and also re-secure things so they look nice and new. And never unpack LOL dolls or surprise/mystery box gifts! (duh?). You're also allowed to...not do this...its jut a suggestion for some of those peskier packages!
