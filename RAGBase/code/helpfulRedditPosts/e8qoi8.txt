LPT: if your child does something (like cleaning) out of the norm, don't ridicule them for it. Positively reinforce it.

When I was younger, I got to the age where I started helping out. I can't remember exactly what happened the first time, but I think I cleaned up the house (5 kids, 2 adults, big house) because my parents needed that extra bit of help. Instead of "hey, thanks for helping out" the end. I got "what's wrong with you? Did you bump your head or something" and I remember one time I was washing up, my mum called for "everyone come quick" because I was doing the washing up and it'll never happen again so take a look whilst you can.

Even now, as an adult, if she's over and I get the hoover out she'll say "are you feeling alright" and my sister now says it too.

It makes me so uncomfortable that I have to clean in private, when my partner is out. I feel like I'm being ridiculed or judged if there is anyone in the house. Then once I've got it perfect if my mum or sister come over they'll say "oh has _fianc√©_ been polishing?"

I usually say yes, even though its me that does it and I'm a grown ass adult. But then this further proves them right that I do nothing when in actual fact I do. But the thought of saying I did it makes me feel sick because they'll just poke fun at me. 

This has turned into a rant - TLDR don't ridicule someone if they're helping, or they won't want to help again.
