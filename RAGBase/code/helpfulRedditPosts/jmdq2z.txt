LPT: For those who are deaf and suffer from insomnia like me. If you go down stairs to watch tv in the middle of the night, as soon as you turn the tv on, turn the volume down or mute the tv. Just pissed off the rest of the house because I forgot to turn it down and cannot hear it being loud. Oops!
