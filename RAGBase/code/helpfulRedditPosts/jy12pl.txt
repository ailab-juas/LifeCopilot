LPT: if you ever find yourself embarrassed or nervous to do something in public that’ll catch attention, (e.g taking a picture, dancing to some music, singing, etc) remind yourself that you’ll never see those people again

content:
this might be a little cliché and you’ve might’ve heard it before, but it really helps. telling yourself things like, “what are these people going to do? call the s.w.a.t team because i’m (insert activity) in public?”, “i’m never going to see these people in my life again, so why does it matter what they think?” or “we’re all going to die, so i might as well enjoy it and do what i want without shame” will really help you if you feel anxious or embarrassed in public.

(also, for the people with social anxiety, i know this doesn’t help you fully and that it’s an actual illness that requires treatment from professionals, so don’t take this the wrong way. it’s not my intention, it’s just to help out the people who are just naturally really shy. if you have social anxiety, i advise you get help from a professional, but again, i’m no expert on social anxiety, so i obviously don’t have the best advice for you all. anyway, i hope this helped some of you! my best wishes to everyone.)
