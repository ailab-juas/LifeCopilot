YSK: If you cancel your phone plan with AT&amp;T they won't give you any *credit* owed for your last month unless you call and specifically ASK for it.

This just happened minutes ago- 

I was a loyal iPhone customer of 4 years (Thats almost $5,000 revenue), without ever missing a beat on payment. AT&amp;T's plans ceased to be competitive, so I ported my line to T-mobile (who is CRUSHING my old bill, by the way... down from $120 to about ~$70). Being the savvy consumer I am, I knew that every month is paid *IN ADVANCE*. 

Since I cancelled my plan only a few days into the month, I called to confirm that I would receive a pro-rated credit for the unused time- which they confirmed. Well, I went online to check my final bill- guess what? No credit- a balance of 0$.

I got back on the phone, and the customer service rep was surprised that I was previously told I would receive a credit automatically. She had to go in and MANUALLY process my $93 check, which I should receive in 11 days.
