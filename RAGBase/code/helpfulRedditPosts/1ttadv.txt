LPT: Car headrests are detachable because they can save your life

content:
If you go off a bridge/bank into a deep river, you can't open the car door until the pressure equalizes (your car fills up with water) - and while your car fills up with water, it's sinking the whole time, by the time it's full - you're likely on the bottom on the river, and that means you have a long swim ahead of you, and are likely to die if it's a deep river.

EDIT because people keep pointing this out - the first thing you should do is immediately try opening the door, if you're quick you'll be able to open the door before the door is too submerged. If you cannot open the door, try rolling down the window, if that doesn't work:

You'll have to break the window. If you have a special tool in the car (eg. Life Hammer, ResQme), it's easy, if not then you should know the **headrest is a window smashing tool!**

If you find yourself sinking like this, turn around and pull out the headrest - the metal prongs on them are good for smashing windows. Simply grip the headrest at the softhead and ram the prongs down the side of the window in one of the corners, that's where the glass is weakest, hammer down deep, then pull back on the headrest to put pressure on the window - now SHIELD YOUR EYES, because the glass is going to shatter, once the window's shattered, remove most of the leftover glass in the window and swim to safety - it's also been pointed out that some newer cars have buoyant headrests, so if that applies to you, hold on the headrest and it'll act as a floatation device.

If, for whatever reason, you can't swim out through the window, then you're going to have to wait for the pressure to equalise. With the window smashed, the car will fill up much quicker and will equalise pressure quick enough that you're still close enough to the surface to swim. While you're waiting for the pressure to equalise, take slow and deep breathes, remaining calm. Then open the door and swim to safety, again - if your headrest doubles as  a floatation device, you should hold on to it.

Now obviously, DO NOT go taking off your headrest and storing it in the glove compartment for the day you're sinking in a river, the headrest's primary function is to prevent you from breaking your neck in a collision, keep it on your seat and (of course) adjusted to the correct height.

There's also **no guarantee this will work**, if you have the money, you absolutely should go buy one of those special tools designed for this.

**TL;DR** - See video demonstration below.

**ALSO NOTE:** You should check that your headrests are actually detachable before going racing on bridges - it appears some cars don't actually have detachable headrests, if that's the case for you. Go get a Life Hammer or a ResQme, or as /u/NyQuil012 says, you could just buy a cheap centre-punch (but I don't know how effective a centre-punch is versus the proper tools - so, uh - at your own risk and all that).
