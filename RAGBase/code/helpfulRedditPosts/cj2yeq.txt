LPT: If you have a 1-3yr old, occasionally open up the family album and have them recognize family members and practice saying family members' names. They will be very happy to be recognized and hear their name spoken when they meet for family get-togethers.

My sister and brother-in-law did this for my nephew. When my nephew first starting talking he was able to say Ty-Ty(name is Tyler). It meant the world to me. Just to see the smile on his face and to be able to recognize my face and say my name.
