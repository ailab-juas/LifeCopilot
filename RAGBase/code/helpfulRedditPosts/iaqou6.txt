YSK that trimming a cats whiskers can be psychologically traumatic for them as they are needed to properly gauge and make sense of their environment.

content:
In short, cat's have a sensory organ at the end of their whiskers called a proprioceptor. If you trim them, it can cause them to become disoriented and have trouble moving around. My friend's mother trimmed their cats whiskers when giving him a haircut, and it truly hurt my heart. I wanted to share this in case some might not be aware.
