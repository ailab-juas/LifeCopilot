YSK you don't always have to brake; most of the time just ceasing to accelerate will suffice

Don't be the cause of the [slinky effect]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion_effect) 


Please just learn how to drive your car and think about more than the text you're trying to send. Pretty please.

Edit: Could we just make PSA driving tip commercials? Broadcast them on TV and before youtube videos? Someone with lots of money should do this as a charity write off or something.  

Edit 2: to apply this technique, there must be approximately 3 seconds between you and the car in front of you.  A large part of the problem is tailgating, and both tailgating and unnecessary braking  together contribute to our problem. This only applies to moving traffic, not stopped traffic in large cities, obviously.
