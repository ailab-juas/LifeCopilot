YSK: When walking your dog in the sun, you should use sunscreen on yourself if the walk is 15+ minutes. Certain dog breeds should have sunscreen too!

Sunscreen and walks - protect yourself and your dog(s)!!

Why YSK: It takes just 15 minutes for UV rays from the sun to damage our skin, increasing the likelihood of cancer, wrinkles and aging. If you're like me, you walk your dog multiple times a day and often times for 15-30 min, maybe longer. It's summer and the sun is more present than ever, so you can end up in the sun multiple times a day.. It's very important to protect yourself!! Daily sun exposure can be bad in the long term without sunscreen. 


If your dog is one of the breeds that have less fur, light thin fur, etc, they also may need some type of protection! There is sun screen for dogs.   They don't know any better and if they're a breed that is more at risk to suffer complications from too much sun exposure, it's your job to prevent it!!

I know a lot of people may not consider this health risk for something as simple as walking their dogs, but if it helps just one person, I consider this post a success.
