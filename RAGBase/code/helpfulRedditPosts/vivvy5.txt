LPT: During a job interview after they question you about your experience turn it around by asking them why you would want to work for them and what they have to offer for you. shifting an interview like that will show MASSIVE confidence and gets you into a much better position for discussing terms.

Edit: Sorry for the way I worded it in the title. In a real situation of course you'd ask that with more tact like "What would be the benefit working for you compared to the competition?"
I also don't want to imply that you should answer their question with another question. 

I genuinely wanted to say with that, that people should interview the company the same way they are getting interviewed. Both sides want something out of this so not just blindly accepting everything and instead also asking them questions will have a positive effect. 

I am truly sorry for misunderstandings

Edit 2: there might of course also be differences between different countries and cultures of course so I guess this applies differently depending on where you live.
