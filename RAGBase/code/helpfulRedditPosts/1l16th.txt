YSK about Amazon Lockers which are password protected lockers located in stores such as 7/11 that you have items shipped to and you can pick-up.

I just found out about these earlier this month when i saw these large yellow lockers in one of my local 7/11s and they turn out to be Amazon Lockers. Which are lockers that you can have products, that are handled via Amazon and within certain dimension restrictions delivered to. I think that these are very useful for people who leave in urban areas where packages my be taken off your stoop. I'm currently in University City, Philadelphia and i can see this being a safe alternative for having items delivered to me should i choose.

Having read into the service here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201117910

You put the address of the locker which you can look up the nearest one to you and it's shipped there. The downfalls i see are that if all the lockers are full the delivery person will try again the day after so one must relie on the promptness of people to pick up their packages in a timely manner.

You also are emailed the electronic password to the locker in which your package is placed once it has arrived at the locker and i assume that these passwords change but i'm not sure.


All in all, i think that this is a nice service and a fair alternative to the post office/p.o. box if your post offices are further away or something.
