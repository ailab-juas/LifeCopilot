YSK: Stuff to keep in your car (Rest of life edition)

Why YSK: You can save yourself a ton of headaches with a minimal amount of preparation

I was responding to this (very good) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/wexthg/ysk_roadtrip_edition/) about various tips you should know for driving. The tips are great, but the stuff to carry in your car felt incomplete. This started as a comment but got so big I didn't want to hijack that OP's thread.

To add to the list of Stuff to keep in the car as a fellow road warrior (and ex-Private Investigator who sometimes had to spend days on the road) :

* JUMPER CABLES: Absolutely number one on the list. I was originally typing this as a reply to a post that already mentioned them.
* SPARE TIRE: Evidently this isn't standard any more, based on the comments! Seriously, go check your vehicle right now. You do not want to need this and not have it.
* Tire air compressor and pressure gauge (Compressor is another one from the comments. Gauge is from me. Know the right PSI for your tire. You can usually find this on a sticker inside the door but ~~it's actually on the tire itself too~~ EDIT: don't use the number on the tire; that's the max PSI the tire can hold. Use the one on the door sticker. Thank you to the user who pointed that out!).
* $20 bill, cash (Another one I was reminded of in the comments. This will feed you, gas up your car, or get you a little bit of help if you need it. I've used every one of these I've ever had in my car).
* Pen and paper (Another from the comments. I actually just carry these on me all the time, but it's handy in a car too. I suggest one of those little notebooks you can fit in your pocket that you can buy in packs of 3-5 and either a Sharpie or a [Zebra F-701](https://www.zebrapen.com/pages/f-701-all-metal-retractable-ballpoint))
* Duct tape (you've no idea how useful this is til you need it and don't have it)
* First Aid kit including antiseptic wipes
* Gloves (basically a second thicker set of skin to put on whenever you need to do anything like change a tire - you do NOT want those potential little cuts to get infected, believe me)
* Multi-tool (best you can afford - go full-sized with a toolbox if you can)
* Flashlight (as solid and excellent as you can afford, and you can actually find some that effectively replace the multi-tool - especially with a knife in the handle. It should be heavy enough to be a deterrent to violence. There's a reason police officers carry those huge Mag Lights...)
* Seatbelt cutter and Window smasher (Lots of people commented to say this. My flashlight actually has a window smasher on the bottom and the knife inside could make fast work of a seatbelt)
* Roll of TP + roll of paper towels
* Water (This is the most suggested thing in the comments and it's a good call. Useful for drinking, cooling the engine, cleaning, and so forth. I'm adding it after paper towels and a regular towel because it's my list and this is where I think it's the funniest.)
* Towel.
* Blanket (I listed this separate from "towel" because it is separate. Don't dual-purpose this one)
* Complete change of clothes including shoes.

I actually keep two changes of shoes in my car. The change of clothes is best when it's as versatile as possible. I'm a guy who works in offices. For me that means a pair of Haggar slacks, a belt, a t-shirt, a button-up shirt, and underwear/socks of preference. That way I can change at work or wherever else. Add a tie if you wear one at work (I kept three of them in the car when I wore a tie at work - they tend to be spill magnets).

I keep a pair of loafers in there, completing the outfit so I am neither particularly over/under-dressed in any situation. Nor particularly noticeable - Gray Man Tactics are actually quite practical in day-to-day life!

I also keep a set of work boots in there. Not because I'm ever about to suddenly go to a construction site, but because I might suddenly have to change a tire or take a walk through some weird terrain. It helps to have a solid pair of boots in either scenario. The kind with the metal sole. Ever try to stomp on a tire iron in trainers or loafers? At best you mess up your shoes. At worst, you can break your foot.

To that note, use your foot to turn your tire iron when loosening lug nuts. There's some discussion in the post I linked about using the "mule technique" ..... I don't know about lying on the ground and kicking up to change lug nuts.. That "mule technique" or whatever? Admittedly I'm bad at picking up on social cues, but is that meant to be a joke? YSKs don't feel like the right place for that. So, like ...  No. Don't do that. Don't lie down in the road...... You're better off using the full force of your body by stomping downward. Let your weight do the work, not your ... Back muscles from the dirt/asphalt.

That said, you should absolutely spring for a cross-bar tire iron. You'll only need to buy it once and the difference in torque will make your life a lot easier. At the very least, find a way to make your tire iron longer. Torque!

Also, if there's a woman in your life for whom these things would be useful (frankly, even if there isn't), a set of women's hygiene products will *absolutely* get used. This is actually somehow the most-used item in my vehicle; for 20+ years, I can't keep them stocked, lol ..

Equally important, stuff to NOT keep in your car: Toiletries like soap and shampoo. Bring that along with you only if you actually think you'll need it. Same with condoms. Don't leave that stuff in your car.

I hope this helps someone out there.

If so, please send this comment to me 20 years ago. Fully everything on this list is from lessons borne of awful experiences. Frankly, it was a little bit traumatic writing this lol ...

EDIT: A lot of people have posted a lot of really good ideas below! The only one I'm going to share here is jumper cables. As I mentioned, I started typing this as a response to another post and decided I didn't want to hijack it - that post included jumper cables which is why I didn't mention them. But yes jumper cables too. They will save your butt. Tons of other good ideas in the replies! :)

Also, a few people are like "THAT'S SO MUCH STUFF!!!!" ... Is it? Someone said you couldn't fit it in a Mini Cooper. Y.. yes you can, I did it for years, lol. And no, I don't have kids. I imagine the list would include *more* stuff if I did.

And as someone else pointed out, this isn't for, like, driving to the grocery store. Again, the context got lost - the post I was replying to was specifically about road tripping (though I still do keep all this stuff in the car at all times). Sorry for the confusion :)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Moved Jumper Cables up to the original list since so many people didn't see that last edit:)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 3: Somewhat-stealing one more idea, since evidently cars don't come with spares any more!?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 4: Waattter.... ::cough:: ... Watttttttterr...

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 5: Editing to add the tire air compressor and to say I'm not going to leave these EDIT notes if I add any more Stuff, lol
