LPT: When giving birth, you are NOT limited to wearing a hospital gown. More comfortable in a (nursing) bra/sports bra, dress, or morning robe? Want to wear nothing at all? Go for it! You get to wear whatever makes you happy.

Added note: I did not expect this to take off, maybe a couple hundred votes of appreciation, but I am glad that this is something y’all appreciate knowing. There are lots of caveats depending on your situation, and this is not for C-section. I am not able to keep up with the comments, but thank you for your time and energy! To all L&amp;D nurses and health professionals, it cannot be said enough, thank you for keeping us safe.

It blew my mind when I learned this even though maybe it should be obvious. You get to wear whatever you want because your comfort is absolutely key. 

*Maybe don’t make it your absolute favorite dress unless you have a real incredible stain remover :)

Media and even hospitals don’t exactly make this clear, so I thought I would put this here.

ETA: I didn’t point this out, but since many others have, I am adding it.
1. Don’t bring clothes you care about. Personally, I’m opting for a sports nursing bra and maybe underwear or an adult diaper depending on needs at the time. Whatever you bring will most likely be ruined.
2. Make sure your clothes don’t obstruct the health professionals. They’ll get cut off in an emergency and they should not obstruct IVs, checking vitals, all that which may be necessary.
3. Clothes should be loose-fitting if you bring any, and avoid sleeves, tight collars, and the like.
Thank you for the feedback!
