LPT: If you're moving or relocating for a job, try to a home/apartment east of your workplace. This will make it so the sun is on your back during the commute to and from work.

Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. In the morning, you'll be traveling west, which makes the sun behind you. In the evening, when the sun is on the west, you'll be traveling east which also puts the sun behind you. 

Edit: Alright all you smartasses. I didn't say that this was the *sole* factor to consider when buying a new house. There's obviously a lot involved in the process, and I'm just sharing one aspect that has been a pleasant surprise for me. I just moved into an apartment that's east of where I work, and  noticed that I'm almost never staring into the sun on the highway, which is the majority of my drive. Sure this isn't applicable to *everyone*, but it could just be another factor to consider when finding a new house if you know you'll be driving everyday.
