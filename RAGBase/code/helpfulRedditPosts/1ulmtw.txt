YSK there's a site where you can listen to different types of background noises in any combination, especially helpful for trying to get to sleep.

There are static sounds, nature sounds, etc. that can be played together or individually.  I just open it on my phone while it's plugged in and go to bed.  It's significantly cut down the time I just lay there trying to sleep.
