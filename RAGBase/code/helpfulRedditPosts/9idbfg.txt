LPT: High schoolers, dont think you have to go to college to be successful. Not great at school?, look at learning a trade. You can make a good, sustainable income as an electrician, plumber, welder, etc. You can enroll in a technical college, or better yet find a apprenticeship at a larger company

Wow didnt think this would blow up over night, thanks for all the advice anyone.

I personally graduated an electrical apprenticeship at a shipyard after failing out of college twice.  I wish I found the apprenticeship straight out of high school, but my school, and I'm sure many others, really pushed you to get a degree.

I now work for a military contractor making a pretty good wage.  I encourage anyone looking to get into an apprenticeship to reach out to their local trade union. Not only will they provide quality OJT, but most places will provide a free college degree like mine did.
