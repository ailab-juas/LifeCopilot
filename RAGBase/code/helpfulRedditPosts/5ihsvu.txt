title:
LPT: You need motivation only till a habit is formed. After that, routine will take care of itself.

content:
You want to start going to gym? Muster enough motivation to go for a couple of months. Body will get into the habit and it will get effortless down the line.  

Edit:  
- Wow, woke up to a gold! Thanks to that person. Also, don't form a habit of gilding people. Bad for your wallet gainz. :) 
- Yes, I know "until" should have been used but I felt "only till" had a better punch due to the use of "only".   
- Lots of people are having a negative reaction in the comments citing things like "discipline is more important", "I have been doing X for Y years and still is not easy.", etcetra. To those people I say: This is a LPT on reddit that is condensed to a few lines. Of course, it doesn't have nuances and further explanations. It would be a much better and productive experience if you use this subreddit as a place where you get things to ponder about and use it by customising it to your life. Of course, you are not going to become a robot who will happily do every thing good for him/her/entire world. Westworld couldn't do that even with actual robots. Gosh, people!     
- I have skimmed a very few number of comments but it feels good to see that I helped push someone out there in a [positive direction](http://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5ihsvu/lpt_you_need_motivation_only_till_a_habit_is/db95fak).
