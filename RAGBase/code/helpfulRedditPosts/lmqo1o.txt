YSK Even if you go to a reputable breeder, mutts universally carry a lower risk of health issues than pure bred dogs.

Why YSK: This is regardless of the ethics of backyard breeders and puppy mills. I talk to a lot of people that go out of their way and pay top dollar for certain breeds to ensure a strong, healthy dog. Unbeknownst to them, if their main concern is the dog’s health and longevity, they’d be better off dropping $25 at the local shelter for a mutt.

Edit: A lot of salty breeders in this thread. I don’t mean all pure breeds are inherently worse in any way, and I absolutely understand seeking out pure breeds as working dogs. I was more directing this post at the average person looking to get a pet dog.
