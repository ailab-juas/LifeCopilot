LPT: If your toothpaste says it repairs 
your teeth check for Novamin as an 
active ingredient. It's the only one that 
does repair teeth.

content:
A lot of different brands claim to strengthen your teeth. **Novamin** is a substance that turns to artificial enamel when in contact with water and binds to your teeth. If the toothpaste you use doesn't have it as active ingredient then it doesn't repair dick.

EDIT: Ebonyks mentioned it's also named "**calcium sodium phosphosilicate**" on some packaging
