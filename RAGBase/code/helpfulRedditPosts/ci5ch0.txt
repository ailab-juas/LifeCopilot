YSK what happens when you throw trash into a recycling bin.

content:
This article came out a couple months ago, and it's pretty accurate about what happens.

As someone who works in this industry, recycling is our most hated line of business. Too many customers and businesses do not adhere to all the instructions given even when the container itself says right on it "CARDBOARD ONLY". My company gets charged over $2,000 a month for contaminated loads.

Recycling isn't all sunshine and rainbows many people think it to be. It's not as simple as the plastic getting melted down and reshaped, and not as simple as paper or cardboard getting "reused".

Many municipalities are jumping on the fad that is "going green", but in all honesty, recycle is anything but green. Not to mention, I have lost count how many times we see recycle trucks come to our landfill to dump their recycling. Dumping at the landfill is sometimes more financially efficient than dumping at the recycling center.

***Here are some excerpts from the article:***

&gt;You might think you’re helping the environment when you start tossing everything into your recycling bin willy nilly, but you might be causing more harm than good. Take, for instance, an unwashed pasta sauce jar. It could potentially contaminate sought-after items, like paper and cardboard. Plastic shopping bags pose the biggest problem for recycling facilities, as the bags can wrap around machinery and could cost over $10,000 to replace

&gt;And that Starbucks cup we mentioned earlier? While technically it *can* be recycled, [it’s usually not](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/business/starbucks-cup-problem/index.html) due to the fact that the paper cups are lined with—you guessed it—plastic, and recycling facilities would have to separate the plastic liner from the paper cup, a costly process. Like plastic bags that damage machinery, trying to recycle these cups without separating the plastic from the paper can also do harm to a recycling center’s machines.

&gt;Your good intentions may be costing the environment *and* the economy. Aspirational recyclers, the Starbucks cup tossers, for instance, or those who hope that their greasy pizza box will go through a metamorphosis into a beautiful cardboard butterfly, are better off throwing it away. “If more than 1 percent of the box is soiled with grease and cheese, we have to throw it out because food waste is a prohibited item. There are very stringent standards we have to meet,”...
