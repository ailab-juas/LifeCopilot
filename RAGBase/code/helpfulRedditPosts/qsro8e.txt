LPT: Next time you are making sloppy Joes / manwiches / maid-rites, grab yourself hotdog buns instead of burger buns.

Why you should know: 
The hot dog buns allow for a much more satisfying experience over the hamburger buns. They allow for a better contained loose meat sandwich which means less mess. It also means you don't lose half of your meat by the last few bites and have to scoop it back up to maintain proper meat to bread ratio. Lastly, hot dog buns are a touch sweeter than hamburger buns... who doesn't like sweet buns? Amirite?

Edit:grammar/spelling
 
Edit 2: Thanks to those who gave awards. Never thought my preferred sloppy joe assembly would get this popular. 
 
To those who say this doesn't belong in LPT; I cannot disagree with you. It really is just my preferred way to eat this food.

To those who ask what is a maid-rite, its a sloppy joe without the sauce. Still seasoned, just no sauce.
 
I am enjoying all the input! I look forward to trying these new variations of ingredients and meat-to-mouth vessels.
