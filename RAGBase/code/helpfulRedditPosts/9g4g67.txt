LPT: Be Completely Honest With Medical Professionals At All Times

content:
I cannot tell you how important it is to be 100% honest. It very well could be life or death for you. Ex: if you are having a heart attack/cardiac symptoms and you have taken viagra, cilalis or any other erectile dysfunction drug it can create a deadly mix when/if you are administered nitro and cause your blood pressure to bottom out. 

People are hesitant to be honest but believe me when I say, they don’t care and they are only there to help you. This goes for all drugs, recreational or prescription. Be honest, stay alive. 

Edit: this also applies for speaking up if your friend/loved one is unconscious. I see this a lot and it happens when someone OD’s and their friend or whoever witnessed/knows what’s going on will lie to try and cover up. There are recreational drugs that need specific meds to save someone’s life and there are others that will react and cause more harm. These are the instances where medical professional (EMT’s, paramedics) need to know the truth.
