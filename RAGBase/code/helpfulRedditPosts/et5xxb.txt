LPT: Open ended invites go a long way. Instead of asking a new friend if they can or can't do something, let them know what you're doing and tell them that they are welcome to join if they would like to. No pressure.

I've been extended invitations to things, so many times, where the person inviting me seems to want an immediate yes or no. As an introverted person, this puts me in a difficult position. I've ignored phone calls in the past because of the anxiety that comes with immediate expectations. Instead of, "can you meet me at O'Neill's on Friday night?" try, "I'm going to O'Neill's Friday night. If you would like to join me, that would be great!" It gives us introverts some time to think over the situation and make an honest decision.
