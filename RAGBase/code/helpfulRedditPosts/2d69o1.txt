LPT: Practice name-remembrance mnemonics while watching television to make it an unconscious habit

content:
Are you terrible at remembering names? I was, and spent a lot of time reading about [mnemonic techniques](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=how+to+remember+names) to fix it. The problem was, it takes a good deal of practice for many people to turn these techniques into a habit, and therefore do it on a regular basis when meeting new people. 

My solution was to practice various techniques while watching television. New characters are constantly being introduced on shows, and many of the techniques out there can be practiced in the comfort of your own home. Techniques that involve saying names out loud can seem a little silly at first, but if you can get past the self-consciousness, it really helps. Give it a try! After a few weeks, I found myself doing these things whenever I met someone new, and haven't had to suffer a horrible "What's your name again?" moment since.
