title:
YSK that is it very easy to apply for federal student loan forgiveness

content:
Why YSK: most people expect a huge hassle when dealing with government services (for good reason: a lot of gov't programs are incredibly difficult to navigate). But for this program, they've focused on making the application very easy. You can get up to $20k cancelled if you have had Pell Grants or $10k if you haven't, which is a potentially life changing amount of money for a lot of people.
