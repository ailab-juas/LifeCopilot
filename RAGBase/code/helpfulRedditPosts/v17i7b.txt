LPT Introverts please listen. You really only need to talk to one person at a party.

I’m 55 with some remaining social anxiety. We are visiting my sister in Virginia. My sister hosted a party for me on Saturday for several hours. By the end I was exhausted and needed to recover. 

The next morning she said she was invited to a large gathering later that night and would I like to join her. I hesitated and she gave me good advice. The person you really need to introduce yourself to at a party is the host. You can play with the pets, wander the yard, talk to only people you know but before you leave always thank the host. Most likely the host is more anxious than you but they WILL REMEMBER you thanking them and appreciate it greatly and they will consider inviting you again. 

Hope that’s helpful.
