LPT: When working in a cubicle environment, disable your laptop's speakers.

content:
I listen to music most of the day on my headphones but sometimes I forget to plug my headphones in before I start the music. Another co-worker did this but they thought the music was coming through really soft through their headphones but what they were hearing was the laptop speakers blaring. To avoid this extremely embarrassing moment, just right click on the volume button on the task bar &gt; playback devices &gt; right click on your speakers &gt; Disable. Also, right click in that window and select Show Disabled Devices to easily Enable/Disable your speakers.
