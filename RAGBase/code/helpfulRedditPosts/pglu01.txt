LPT: Stay out of Floodwater if you can. It's full of things that can hurt you or make you sick.

content:
Every time there's a flood, there's videos of people making funny videos in the floodwaters. This is a very bad idea. According to the CDC: "Floodwater may contain sharp objects...Open woulds and rashes exposed to floodwater can become infected." Floodwater can also contain sewage. Try to avoid floodwater if possible, and make sure you wash anything that comes into contact with it!
