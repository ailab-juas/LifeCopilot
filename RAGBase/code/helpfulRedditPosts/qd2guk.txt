LPT: If you're getting divorced, remember each of your attorneys' hourly rates before arguing over possessions

content:
This was amazing advice my lawyer gave me when I got divorced. Each of them billed $250 an hour. He told me about couples he's seen spend so much arguing over the couch, china hutch, whatever, they could have each bought one brand new with money to spare. It definitely kept things in perspective.
