LPT: Got problems with wasps nesting on or near your house? Brown paper bags may help.

content:
I know it sounds ridiculous, but let me explain. Many years of my life were spent living in the Texas backwoods. And every house out in the sticks had major problems with wasps, every summer.

The last one, I had a roommate. We were shopping for house supplies, and I went to grab a can of wasp spray, and he stops me. I still grabbed the can in case any got inside, but he said he had a solution.

So we bought some relatively small brown paper bags, fluffed them out and stapled them up around the house. And much to my surprise, the wasps were almost entirely gone in about a week.

Roommate explained that wasps think the bags are hornet nests or something, and it scares them off. I'm not sure if I believe that part, but it worked either way.

The only issue comes when it rains, but paper bags are cheap and easy to replace.

Edit: Damn this post blew up. Glad we could come together in our mutual hatred of wasps. Also, thanks for the awards!
