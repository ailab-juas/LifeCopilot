LPT: A few genuinely kind, empathetic words can help you bond and find common ground with people quicker. "I hear you." "I see that was hard for you." "Thanks for making me laugh. I needed that." We all need to know we're seen and heard and cared about. Be kind and kind people will be drawn to you.
