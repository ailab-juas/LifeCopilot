LPT: Reminder that you can create unlimited email addresses in gmail by adding a plus sign followed by a word to your existing address. Use different emails such as email+netflix@gmail.com, email+spotify @gmail.com for different services.

This also helps identify who is selling your email since spam will be addressed to the specific email. You can filter out the address to keep your inbox spam free.

Edit: Just to be clear, you donâ€™t have to create a new email address just use this format when signing up on a website. The emails will still reach your original mailbox.
