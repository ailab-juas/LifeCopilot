[Nikola Tesla’s 3 Best Productivity Tricks](http://lifehacker.com/nikola-teslas-best-productivity-tricks-511266179)

Learn 3 great tips to be more productive and inventive from the great inventor Nikola Tesla. What I really like about these tricks is that they all involve using your thoughts to make your ideas come to life. That is basically what being a thinkist is all about. Nikola Tesla was a great inventor and thinker who used his imagination to come up with amazing ideas that changed the world. One of his best tricks was to make sure he spends time in solitude thinking, away from the noise and thoughts of other people and the world.

&gt; “The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.”

Spend some time in solitude to think about and create ideas to solve your problems.
