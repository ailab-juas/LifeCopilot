LPT At the beginning of EVERY semester, make a dedicated folder for your class where you download and save all documents ESPECIALLY the SYLLABUS. Teachers try to get sneaky sometimes!

Taught this to my sister last year.

She just came to me and told me about how her AP English teacher tried to pull a fast one on the entire class.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had it happen to me before as well in my bachelors.

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher changes the syllabus to either add new rules or claim there was leniancy options that students didn't take advantage of. Most of the time it's harmless but sometimes it's catastrophic to people's grades.

&amp;#x200B;

In my case, teacher tried to act like there was a requirement people weren't meeting for their reports. Which was not in the original syllabus upload.

&amp;#x200B;

In my sister's case, the english teacher was giving nobody more than an 80% on their weekly essays. So when a bunch of students complained and brought their parents, he modified the syllabus to act like he always gave them the option to come in after school and re-write the essays but they never took advantage of it. One of my sister's friends was crying because her mom, a teacher at that school, was mad at her for not going in for the make-up after school.

When confronted about this not being in the original syllabus, he acted like it was always there. My sister of course had the original copy downloaded and handled it like a boss! Now people get to make up their missed points and backdate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry to all good teachers out there but not all teachers are as ethical as we'd like to think.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

AP English is in high school, it's an advanced placement class equivalent to a college credit. Difficult but most students in there are hard working.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Edit:

The goal of doing this is not to catch a teacher in their lie, the reasons to make a folder dedicated for a class from day 1 and keeping copies of everything locally are too many to list, they include taking ownership, having records, making it easy for yourself, learning to be organized, having external organization, overcoming lack of organization in an LMS, helping you study offline, reducing steps needed to access something, annotating PDFs, and many more. The story here is teachers getting sneaky but I have dozens more stories to show why you should do it in general for your own good.
