LPT: If you're ever in the situation where CPR is urgently required, compress hard to the beat of "Stayin' Alive" - by the Bee Gees. It's the correct timing of compressions.

Thanks all for making this a highly visible tip. My message as a first responder (firefighter): If you're not first aid trained, **book in to get trained, now!** It's easy, doesn't take long (a weekend at most) and gives you the skills to save lives. Emergencies happen without warning, I know from experience. Knowing what to do and how to delegate tasks during an emergency will dramatically improve the victims chances of survival. 

**Get trained. Do not put it off. You do not want to regret putting off your first aid course if a friend or a loved one needs your skills and focus.**

Regarding liability: **check your local laws** as this varies by state and country. Almost all jurisdictions have 'good will' or 'good samaritan' legislation that waives liability for assistance rendered in an emergency. If in doubt: **always call an ambulance/render assistance if able**.

Orangered me more trainers if you know of any.

Seems strange, though is true. The rhythm beat in ["Stayin' Alive"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY) is the correct rate of compression to give to a heart attack victim.

Play the song in your head, or get someone to play it on their phone for you **after you've asked how far the ambulance is away** - this both ensures that someone has actually *called* an ambulance **and** gives you a estimated time of paramedics arrival. 

One other thing: **press hard**, with **locked arms**. CPR shown on TV shows and movies where the first aider's arms bend during compressions is **incorrect** and is most definitely not hard enough.

Effective compressions are 1/3rd of the way into an adult victims chest. Don't be afraid to break bones. A few cracked ribs are a much better alternative to death.

Keep calm and keep compressing until paramedics take over.

LPT2: If you're not first aid trained (or at the very least CPR trained), **do it**. It's easy and equips you with the skills to save lives.

Rules in this sub-reddit advise against giving medical advice. Screw it. This is a vital skill that **everyone** should know how to do in a pinch and does save lives. 

**Immediately providing CPR compressions after an apparent cardiac arrest will --dramatically-- improve the victims chances of survival**.
