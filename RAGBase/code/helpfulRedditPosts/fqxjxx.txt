YSK if you can't find your favorite brands of food staples in stores, you can often order them directly from the manufacturer

content:
Many companies accept orders from individuals as well as wholesale for store shelves, and will even waive shipping fees over a certain amount. 

Just Google the company name to find their website and it should be easy from there.

This is especially useful right now, I've found, with dry goods and pantry type items (noodles, powdered soup mixes, canned evaporated milk, etc.).

Hope this helps - and please, don't hoard.
