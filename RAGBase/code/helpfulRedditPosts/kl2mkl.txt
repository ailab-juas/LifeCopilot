LPT: If you have any questions for the USPS, the fastest way to get an answer is right here on Reddit: r/USPS has actual, knowledgeable employees hanging around being incredibly helpful.

Be sure to be kind to them!  They have had a very hard peak season and even if you don’t have a question for them, it would be nice to tell them how much their hard work means to you and your family this Christmas season!

Edit:  The people at r/USPS don’t know where your package is. They don’t have any better way to track it than you do.
