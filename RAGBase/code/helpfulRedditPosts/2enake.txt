YSK the difference between the two types of Open Bar

content:
**Hosted**

Client puts down a deposit (maybe $20 per person x 150 people = $3000), prior to the event.  Depending on how much is consumed they may have to pay more if the $3000 deposit is exceeded or possibly receive a refund if it is not.  Basically, they are at some point paying for every drink.

**Flat rate**

They put down a set amount (say $30 per person x 150 people = $4500)  prior to the event.  Regardless of how much or how little alcohol is consumed they will not pay any more and will not receive a refund.  This is the closest you can come to getting "free" drinks if somehow the bar is broken. In most cases this means the average number of drinks per person hits about 5 liquor or about 7 beers. *Average* Meaning someone's gotta make up for granny who had water all night.  It very rarely happens.

Working in weddings for a few years now I'm assuming a good amount of people don't know this as I see dozens and dozens of abandoned drinks through out each night that have barely been touched.  9/10 open bars are going to be Hosted, not flat so unless you know for sure which it is I would assume hosted and don't be as willy nilly with your drinks assuming they're "free".  Your hosts are most likely paying peak prices for them.
