title:
YSK that underage drinking will not be penalized in 17 states if reporting a medical emergency.

content:
Alcohol should never be the reason medical help is not obtained but in 17 states even if you are too young to drink getting help for someone will not get you in trouble even if you were illegally drinking also. In addition to that, underage drinking is allowed in 29 states with parental consent(on private land) and in 6 states it is allowed(on private land) without parental consent.
