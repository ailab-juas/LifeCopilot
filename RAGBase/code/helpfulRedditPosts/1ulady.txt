LPT: Be prepared when driving in extremely cold weather by putting blankets, snacks, and a small tool kit in your vehicle in case you have any car troubles on the road.

Also, try to avoid keeping bottled water/drinks in the car especially in subzero weather because they can explode.  If you're stuck in the snow, then just use that for liquids.  Bonus: use a cup to put the snow in for easier consumption.

Edit: As others have already pointed out, let the snow melt into water before drinking it.
