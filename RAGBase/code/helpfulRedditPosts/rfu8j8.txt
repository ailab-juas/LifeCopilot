YSK that Time magazine's "Person of the Year" isn't necessarily praising the person selected

content:
Why YSK: often when Time announces their Person of the Year, it's met with backlash because people think the person they chose is undeserving of praise, and they suggest people they think should have been person of the year instead, providing less influential but morally better options.

Time magazine isn't always praising the person they select. It is who they think "for better **or for worse**... has done the most to influence the events of the year"

Hitler and Stalin have been person of the year. Elon Musk being person of the year doesn't mean that time thinks Elon Musk is the greatest person of the year. They think he was the most influential, whether that be good or bad.

Edit- couple things- I do believe Time was praising Elon this year with the award, however that doesnt change what the award is. If you hate Elon, you shouldn't consider it an insult to the award or to the other people who have won it or anything. And again, when people go around saying that so-and-so deserved it more, they are often misunderstanding the meaning of the award.
