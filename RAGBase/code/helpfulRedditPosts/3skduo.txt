LPT: Whenever you have someone working for you like a landscaping crew, remodeling crew, or any other hired workers, make sure to let them know you appreciate their hard work by taking some time to shoot the breeze, tell them how much you appreciate their work, or simply wave.

Source: I'm a landscaper, and I actually enjoy working for people when they take a couple minutes to shoot the breeze. It makes me want to do a better job than when we're mowing a yard where I've never even seen the person or they try to avoid us at all costs and don't acknowledge our existence. Something as simple as a wave goes a long way.

Edit: Shooting the breeze = chatting.

Edit 2: For those of you saying that a customer shouldn't do something like this because they're the one paying the bill, blah blah blah...I think you missed the point. I'm not saying any hired workers should EXPECT anything like this, I'm telling the people who hire them an inside tip that they'll probably do a better job if they treat them like a human being.
