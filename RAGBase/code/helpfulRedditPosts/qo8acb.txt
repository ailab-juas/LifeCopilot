LPT: Green potatoes contain a neurotoxin called solanine. Throw them away!

content:
Posting because what I thought was common knowledge isn't as well known as I thought. My roommate recently ate several green baked potatoes and got really bad headaches and nausea for several days. They only knew it was the potatoes because I noticed one on the counter and mentioned it needed to be thrown away, to which they responded with a puzzled expression. Explained that they make you sick (and can potentially kill you) only to find they had already eaten 2 whole mostly green potatoes.

Also, green potatoes aren't "underripe". Once they are green, they won't be edible again, you have to throw it out, or at least cut off the green part if it's very small. Posting to hopefully save someone from similar suffering, as apparently many people doing know this.
