LPT: Express gratitude, rather than apologize, to keep people on your side when you make a mistake.

content:
I work retail, and if a customer is waiting for a while, it’s natural for me to say, “Sorry for the wait.” That immediate puts fault on me and puts the customer in a position to either admonish me or forgive me. Neither is appropriate in a sales situation. 

Instead, I’ve started saying things like, “Thank you for waiting. I appreciate your patience.” Then you’ve complimented them. They feel like the bigger person, just for having done the ‘kind gesture’ of not knowing *you still hold the reins.*
