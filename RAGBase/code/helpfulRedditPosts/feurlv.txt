YSK if you're thinking about hoarding toilet paper, get a bidet attachment for your toilet seat instead. It's cleaner, costs less and it's much more environmentally friendly/sustainable.

Actually, just get one no matter what. I was sceptical at first too, but it's so worth it. They're cheap and easy to install and you'll wonder why you waited so long to have a clean butt.

And because manufacturing toilet paper uses so much water, it actually uses less water to have a bidet instead.
