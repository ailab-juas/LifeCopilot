LPT: Compliment your perpetually single friends, or even tell them why you love them, regularly. They may not have anyone to do so for long stretches of time and it can take a toll on their mental health.

I’m the perpetually single friend.  There’s nothing wrong with me, I’m just career driven and unlucky in love. I also have a shitty family (shout out to r/raisedbynarcissists). Due to this I have gone months, almost years, without anyone telling me they love me. I regularly go weeks without anyone complimenting me or reminding me I’m cared for.  It’s rough. 

I’ve also been in a number of long-term relationships and I know it’s common (in the western world at least) to compliment your partner on the reg, and for some to use the L-word almost daily. 

Life can be tough alone, and it’s easy to forget why people should care about you.  So remind your friends why you care every once and a while. It could make a big difference.

Edit: Wow! Thank you everyone.  I’ve never won an award before so this response is incredible (but please save your coins peeps)! I’m glad (and sad) this resonated with so many of us, and I hope it leads to more affection and compassion between us all.  I see you guys, you have value, and you are loved ❤️
