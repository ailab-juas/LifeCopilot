YSK You can email pictures (from your phone or otherwise) to Imgur, and they will be uploaded to your account and you will receive a confirmation with a link to your image(s)

content:
Just go into the preferences of your Imgur account and configure the email address that you send from, and you're done. Just send your pictures to upload@imgur.com This is how I typically upload from my phone. There are other ways, this is just an option should you prefer email.
