YSK: A simple fan is one of the most effective ways to keep mosquitos away. Entomologists from Michigan State University found that fan-generated wind greatly reduces mosquitoes and they recommend we use it in our backyards to protect ourselves and our pets.

Why YSK:  Mosquitos are very irritating and people try all kinds of tricks to keep them away.  This one actually works.

Just place a fan or two nearby outside and the mosquitos will mostly stay away as they can't fight the wind generated from the fan.  It works really well.
