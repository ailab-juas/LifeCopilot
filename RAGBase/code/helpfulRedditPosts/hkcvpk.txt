LPT: looking for a good therapist is more like dating than making an appointment with your general practitioner; it has to be a fit, not just any one will do. It might take a few bad “first dates” before you find the one.

I hear a lot of people say therapy wasn’t for them and they immediately describe their interaction with the one therapist they’d seen. Try a few different folks! It can be so beneficial if you click with the right one. Some people want someone older to talk to, others a contemporary. A man, a woman, same ethnicity, etc. Even a sense of humor or particular practice, it’s a really nuanced relationship.

Edit: as a number of people have 100% accurately pointed out, it’s an extremely privileged position I’m expressing to be able to go through that process, let alone afford therapy at all. I don’t disagree, therapy is a luxury good here in the US and it should not be. I won’t go into more as I’m just not qualified to speak on the insurance system and mental health needs of the masses, but I hear you, that’s completely valid and I acknowledge that.
