YSK Starting December 1st any salaried employee making below $47.5k a year will be required compensation for overtime

content:
Just a few months heads up. Talk to your boss about it, make other workers aware and make sure you're getting paid what you earn, since it's gonna be required by federal law.

EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up like it did over the weekend. Just got to my desk at work and was a little surprised. Just to clarify (my bad) this does apply to an EXISTING law in America only. You can find further information [here](https://www.dol.gov/featured/overtime) on the Department of Labor's website. I do not believe that it applies to military, teachers I honestly couldn't find out but I would assume they are impacted just as much as any other salaried employee.

I will edit with any other info I find out.
