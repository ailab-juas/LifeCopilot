YSK: Women experiencing domestic abuse who are choked by their partners are eight times more likely to be subsequently murdered by those partners.

Why YSK: Even if it's spurred by momentary anger and they are as apologetic as humanly possible afterwards, this is a **huge** red flag [indicating that this persons anger is likely to drive them towards murder.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.sacbee.com/news/local/article261397102.html)

If you are in an abusive relationship and find yourself being strangled by your partner, or if you know someone who has experienced this specific assault from a current partner, then you need to remove yourself or the person you know from this relationship*ASAP*.

If you are someone who finds yourself being driven to this level of anger then [you need to get help for yourself and for the safety of those around you.](https://www.betterhelp.com/maurvet-minto/?start=true&amp;landing_type=specialty&amp;specialty_type=anger+management&amp;utm_source=AdWords&amp;utm_campaign=storefront&amp;utm_term=anger+management+psychology_e&amp;utm_content=maurvet-minto_101856&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA37KbBhDgARIsAIzce15tpvIulmpLHMd7hJY8rzhfHgiNQSP6-h_3aH1WavGde_99NFAYa0IaAtgNEALw_wcB&amp;not_found=1&amp;gor=rd_maurvet-minto) However you try to rationalise it, this is not normal behaviour.

EDIT: it's been brought to my attention that I need to change the phrase I used in this post: "strangled" is the correct word to use in this situation as it has an important distinction to "choked". 

To be choked is a blocking of the airways to the lungs by an internal obstruction.

To be strangled is to have your airways squeezed or constricted, especially with the intention of causing death.
