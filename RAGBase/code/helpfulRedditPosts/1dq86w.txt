LPT: Chase ants out of your home with simmering cinnamon

content:
I spotted a few ants in the kitchen but didn't want to use a pesticide on them. Remembering a beekeeping tip on how to keep ants out of a hive, I opened all the cabinet doors and simmered a spoonful of cinnamon in a pot of water on top of the stove. They were all gone by the end of the day and were still gone this morning.
