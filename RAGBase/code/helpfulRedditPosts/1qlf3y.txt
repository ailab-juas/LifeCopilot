LPT: get a VPN and change your country before booking on hotel/airline/car rental websites. they often charge vastly different prices based on your location. (explanation in comments)

Many hotels, airlines or rental car companies try to charge different prices based on your I.P. address.

It's a fucked up idea in principle until you realize that you can use this system to get the best price for yourself: all you need is a VPN service that allows you to pretend to be in a different country.

I tried to rent a Mercedes-Benz from the german car rental company EuropCar in Hamburg for two days.

They offered me prices from 142,28 EUR (when they thought I was in Canada) all the way to 362,14 EUR when I used an Australian I.P. address.

The VPN service I use is Astrill. They're okay but pretty much any other VPN service will work for this, too. I heard good things about bolehvpn and pro xpn.
