LPT: Stress Management (Lessons learned from a USAF fighter pilot)

**UPDATE:  TL;DR at bottom of post.  Also, I AM NOT/WAS NOT A FIGHTER PILOT.  I was an enlisted member (Staff Sergeant), being *taught by* a fighter pilot.  Sorry for the confusion.)**

**UPDATE #2:  YOGA IS NOT BAD, YOGA IS GOOD.  Sorry for the confusion there.  I am not hostile towards yoga.  At the time of the training, yoga had surged in popularity and people were using it as a substitute for actual problem solving, so the instructor used it as an example because it was a hot topic.  Yoga is good and DOES make you feel better and DOES relieve stress, but it's imperative to not RELY on it solely for stress management.  Also, others things like yoga, working out, etc, are very good for clearing your mind and focusing.  The instructor said he fed his animals (he had chickens, lol) as a way to clear his head and re-evaluate his pile of stressors.  Yoga is great for that, as is going to the gym, etc.  It will *temporarily* relieve your stress, and also allow you a calm time to make your list of stressors, or even if need be, forget about them for a while.  But it is not a final solution to removing stressors from your life.  So, just to clarify, YOGA IS GOOD.  I didn't mean to demonize it.**

**UPDATE #3:  Thanks so much for the Reddit Gold.  I've never gotten that, so I have no idea what to do, but it's a great honor nonetheless!  I'm just glad I could help (if I was able to), and also must give full credit to the instructor that taught me these lessons in the first place.  I really wish I'd gotten his name, so I could force him to go to every school and workplace to give the same briefing lol**

Long story short: I was forced to go through stress management training during my enlistment, given by an active duty fighter pilot.  Turned out to be the best training I've ever been through.  I don't have his slides, so my version will be the abbreviated one.  Also, I have added some things like analogies and such that helped me understand things better.  I'm going to fit the real meat and potatoes of the training into the first section, then afterwards I might into more detailed descriptions of this or that.  It's gonna be long winded, but if anything just get the middle section read and you'll be good to go.

**Stress Management:**

Stress is not a feeling, an emotion, a mood.  Stop treating it like one. It's a physical thing that happens to your body.  It's your body saying "something is wrong, fix it."  Symptoms of stress/anxiety include things that can be measured by doctors, such as weight gain, lack of sleep, blood pressure issues, acne, hair loss, etc.  Many people try to treat stress as a feeling, and do things to make them *feel* better, like yoga, workout, have sex, go to the gun range, or buy little stress balls that they squeeze when they feel stressed.  This is the incorrect way to deal with stress.  

Think of stress as *financial* stress.  What is financial stress?  You have too much to pay for and not enough money.  If you were financially stressed and I told you I could make you *feel better about it* by selling you a squeeze ball for 20 bucks, would you fall for that garbage?  I hope not.

**This is how stress stacks up on your life:  Imagine a graph.  There is an invisible line somewhere on it going straight, horizontally, all the way across.  That is your personal "stress threshold".  Literally *everything* that you have to do in your life is a stressor.  Imagine them as blocks stacking up on top of each other.  Some are bigger than others.  The closer you get to your threshold, the more stressed you feel.**  If you do not prevent them from *crossing* that threshold, you will enter depression, which is your body saying "screw it, you won't fix it, I'll just shut everything down until it works itself out.", much like how if you're freezing to death in the woods your body starts shutting down to save the vital organs, but you will still eventually freeze to death anyways.  Think of stress as you shivering when it's cold, and depression as your body shutting down to preserve vital organs.

So, this is THE way to manage stress:  You *manage it*.  The pilot giving the training said to make a list, either mentally or literally, of **EVERYTHING** that stresses you out.  Next, look at the list and see what you can actually take care of right then and there, and start knocking things off the list.  You will literally be removing stress from your life.  You ever wonder why people say they feel like their "load is lighter" or "weight has been lifted off their shoulders" after they complete a task?  Because it has.  Ever wonder why people say they feel good after mowing the lawn, or going to the gym, or whatever?  It's because they've actually removed a stress block from their life.  They've *done* something.  Often times, people try to manage stress by drinking tea, or doing yoga, or doing things that *simulate* to their mind that they're accomplishing something, when really they're just tricking their brain into releasing the chemical that it does when you *actually* get something done.  The **REAL** way is to actually identify the things that stress you out, and REMOVE them from your pile of stressors.  

When you make your list, literally write out everything.  Pretty much if you think about something and say "Oh crap, I have to do that.", it's a stressor.  Everything from brushing your teeth in the morning, to changing that light bulb in the laundry room, to gassing up your car, to studying for that test, to out-processing for that deployment, to going to that job interview, etc etc.  Write them down, look at it, and think "Oh shoot, I could just change that lightbulb right now.  I could mow the lawn.  I could fix that door hinge."  Do this and you will be on your way to becoming more productive and less stressed.  I've been doing this for years now and it works GREAT.  It's how these fighter pilots manage their personal lives *and* flying a stupid fast war machine in combat.  There have been a few times where I *did* still get too stressed out, but it was because I literally just had too much on my plate that was beyond my control, but since I *understood* how stress works, I was able to still get ahold of it and break myself out of the slight depression I had slipped into.

**FURTHER NOTES:**

**Types of stress:**

-Residual Stress (AKA Emotional Baggage):  This type of stress cannot be eliminated, or is VERY difficult to remove.  It is things that have happened to you in the past that you drag with you forever.  They *feel* like things you need to "fix", but since they're locked in the past, you can't do anything about them, so they cause your stress pile to start out a little higher no matter what you do.  You fell on your face that one time at school, or your parents never loved you, or you got stage fright that one time, etc etc.  Some people have more than others, and it just always eats at the back of your mind.  I have found an awesome way to get over this, but it is using my interpretation of the "heathen worldview", which is another tip for another time.

-Reoccurring Stress: These are things that pop up on a reoccurring basis, such as daily chores, bills, house or work maintenance, etc.  They are usually small stressors for people, but since they pop up often, they're always needing to be removed anyways.  People often shrug these off, but they can sneak up on you.  If you don't take care of the small things, the big things will stack higher, faster.  Ever heard the phrase "the straw that broke the camel's back"?  That straw was probably a Reoccurring Stressor.

-Time Sensitive Stress:  These are stressors that are hanging over your head but *cannot be taken care of yet*.  Your college finals.  Job interviews.  Upcoming vacation.  Etc.  They are among the hardest for me to deal with, because they *are* there,  but you can't do them yet.  The way to reduce their impact is to ensure you are knocking out the easier stress blocks in the meantime.  Change that lightbulb, get your car serviced, mail that package, etc.  Another way is to recognize the *precursors* to that Time Sensitive Stressor, like *studying* for the college finals, or *preparing* for the job interview.  You will still be knocking things out, being productive, removing stress, *and* will be better prepared for the TSS when it does arrive.

**A note on Depression:**

This part of the training has to basically alienate a specific group of people.  **If you are *clinically* depressed, then this method may not help you manage your depression because your brain works differently.**  Depression is where you haven't removed enough stress blocks and so your body says "screw it".  The danger here is that it will remove your energy, motiviation, etc.  By *understanding* this, you will be able to get back in the saddle, remove some stressors, and get your life back under control.  The pilot/instructor went deeply into the phases of depression, and what is known as a "psychotic break".  Depending on where you are in your depression when you hit your psychotic break, you will lash out in a certain way.  Example: if you're in "inner", you will hurt/kill yourself.  If you're in "outer", you will hurt/kill someone else.  But what makes it a "psychotic break" is that is will be completely bizarre.  The example he used was Brittney Spears shaving her head vs. the NASA officer who went to Florida to kidnap her boyfriend's lover.  Brittney Spears had much less stress on her life, yet she flew through all the stages of depression and basically hit her psychotic break at a point that caused her to just completely snap and shave her head.  The NASA officer underwent a TREMENDOUSLY stressful entire life before finally lashing *out* at a person who made little to no impact on her overall life.  It basically demonstrated how much some people can mentally endure compared to others, and how failure to manage it can cause serious problems. 

**A story of my usage of this training:**

I'll make it quick.  I was a SSGt in USAF.  I was in college full time also.  I had orders to the desert.  I was a crew lead at my base for my specific job.  I had finals for college coming up.  In that *same* week, I had WAPS testing, which is how USAF enlisted troops test for rank.  It's a big deal.  I *ALSO* had to out-process for my deployment that week (anyone in can attest to what a stupid pain in the ass that can be).  I was super stressed and it got to be too much.  But I *understood* how stress worked.  I couldn't make my finals come sooner, nor my WAPS test.  Out-processing could be done during work hours.  But I still had to lead my crew, which entailed all kinds of bullcrap.  So here's what I did.  First thing first, I told another NCO on my crew "Listen man, you're an NCO, you know the ropes, you're the crew lead now."  I literally just dumped part of my plate onto his, but he was trained/qualified/capable of doing it, *and* that's literally what he was there for was to lead the crew if I wasn't around.  So I just made him the primary and I took the alternate slot.  A huge stressor gone.  Next, I ensured all my little stuff was taken care of, such as chores/ honey-do's around the house.  After that, I made sure I had a dedicated time for WAPS and college studying, so that that stressor didn't bleed into my thoughts all the time.  Finally, I made out-processing my primary concern during the work day, so no work-related stressors could pile up.  All I had to do was make appointments and knock things off a checklist.  This literally saved me from becoming overwhelmed and let me make it through the ordeal.  When it was all said and done I did great on my college finals, I didn't make rank (that's OK though, the cutoff score was high for my career that year), and I got to the desert (and back) in one piece.  Thanks random fighter pilot on instructor TDY!

Anyways, I hope this helps someone.  It has gotten me through a lot, and I share it whenever I can.  Take care everyone!       

**TL;DR:  Don't think of stress as a feeling.  Treat it like *financial* stress.  Think of stress as physical blocks stacking up on your life.  They key to keeping stress levels down is to REMOVE the blocks.  Make a list of stress blocks, and ELIMINATE THEM.  It will not just make you FEEL better, it will *make you better*.**
