YSK that the iPhone Reminders app can notify you once you've entered a certain radius of a chosen location.

content:
I use this feature quite frequently while traveling and it's proven to be successful every time. 

For example, today I set my phone to notify me once I'm within 800ft of Ginza Station in Tokyo. This is how I did it.

1. Go into your Reminders app and create a [new reminder](http://imgur.com/IYHXYBN.png) and select the (i)nformation button.

2. Turn on ["Remind me at a location"](http://imgur.com/Q4ic2Nf)
 
3. Enter your desired location, choose "When I arrive" and [set your desired radius](http://imgur.com/lkEVlZn.png). Note: the location must be registered in Apple's native Maps application.
 
4. Go back, select "Done" and it should look [something like this](http://imgur.com/OULvoUe.png). 

Enjoy!

My iOS is still on 8.4 so interface may have changed a bit for updated users.
