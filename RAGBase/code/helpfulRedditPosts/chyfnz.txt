LPT: In your professional life, you don't get what you deserve; you get what you negotiate.

content:
We've all seen people in our careers and asked ourselves, "How the hell did s/he rise to that level?" With the exception of nepotism, the answer is that through whatever means, they negotiated for it. They acted as their own advocate and made the case for themselves. 

Being undeserving but convincing will produce better results than being unconvincing but deserving.
