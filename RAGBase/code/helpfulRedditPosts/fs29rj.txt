title:
YSK - Never mix Ammonia and bleach

content:
Ammonia and bleach are both common cleaning agents in everyday households. But mixing them together as it turns out creates fucking chlorine gas. For those who don’t know chlorine gas was a chemical weapon used in WW2.

Don’t mix bleach and Ammonia

Edit: WW1, actually

Edit2: Chloramine gas then. Still dangerous
