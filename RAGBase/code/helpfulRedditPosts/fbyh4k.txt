LPT: being nice to retail workers is far more likely going to get you what you want

content:
As a manager, if customers were nice to me I would do anything in my power to help them as best as possible. Of course, my default is helping the customer. But if you approach me with an attitude, start demanding shit, or being rude to other workers I will absolutely not help you. There is a difference being frustrated at the situation vs taking it out on the workers. The best managers are the ones that stick by their workers.
