YSK you can stop telemarketers in Australia by putting your number up on a government website. If they call you when your number is up they are breaking the law and may face penalties.

Even if you aren’t on the register they’re breaking the law if they call
* before 9 am or after 8 pm on weekdays
* before 9 am or after 5 pm on Saturdays
* anytime on a Sunday or a national public holiday

If you are still contacted after 30 days you can report it [here](https://www.donotcall.gov.au/consumers/lodge-a-complaint/)

Edit: this only applies to a company trying to sell you something, surveys and such are ok while on the register. Scams are unavoidable obviously and are reported elsewhere.
