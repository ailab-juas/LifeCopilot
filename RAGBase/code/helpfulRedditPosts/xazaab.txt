LPT: Rule of H.A.S.H. -- Don't make important decisions when you're Hungry, Angry, Sad, or Horny.

Using this trick is probably the closest I'll ever come to dodging actual bullets.

Even if it's something "small" like sending that text, replying to that email right away, submitting that online order, having that important conversation, or any other action that has some permanence to it... if you're feeling HASH, don't do it right now. Just hit snooze and revisit it later with a clear head. Odds are you'll find a better option that you didn't see the first time, and you'll avoid potentially shooting yourself in the foot.

The hardest part of this is that once you're gripped by one of these emotions it can feel like a *reeeeaaaally good idea* to act RIGHT NOW, especially if you don't realize you're in a state and believe that you are thinking clearly. Pulling that trigger is going to feel satisfying for all of two minutes, until your head clears and you realize you were being an ass and now you're saddled with the consequences of whatever rash decision you just made. Just hit snooze and come back to it later. The odds that the situation actually needs immediate, drastic action are very low.

The more I follow the role of HASH in my everyday life, the more aware I become of all the situations where I *definitely* would have self-sabotaged had I acted when the impulse first hit me.

I had shared this idea with some friends, they said I should post it here. Hope y'all find it as useful as I have. 

Do any of you follow a similar rule for yourself? Any experiences that would have benefitted from this in hindsight?
