title:
YSK that there is an app called TraffickCam that allows you to upload photos of your hotel room to a database that allows authorities to determine where perpetrators of sex trafficking are committing their crimes.

content:
Easily downloadable from the App Store. üòä

Edit: this is how the app works‚Äîyou snap a few photos of your hotel room. Identifying characteristics help, such as a unique piece of art, landmark out the window, or specific bed spread. These photos get logged into the database where they can be compared with photos that detectives already have of suspected trafficking victims. Lots of times traffickers will use hotel rooms to ‚Äúshowcase‚Äù (yuck) their victims and post those images to the dark web. The app has smart software that can digitally read the room and hopefully provide quick answers in the future to catch these things happening in the act.

I‚Äôve posted some resources below as well, in case anyone doesn‚Äôt have a smart phone or doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable downloading an app like this.
