title:
YSK that OCD is not about being neat or anal

content:
Why YSK: Obsessive compulsive disorder is often misused as being obsessive over alignment and patterns. The mistaken views can be quite damaging and misleading. The compulsions are often a result of an irrational fear of themselves or loved ones becoming sick or die if they don’t perform different actions almost ritually, despite knowing its irrational. A lot of issues regarding mental health has been wrongly portrayed in media and can lead to people not seeking help because they don’t know that their struggles might be treatable.
