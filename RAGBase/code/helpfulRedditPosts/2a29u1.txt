title:
YSK Comcast could be using your router as a Wifi Hotspot

content:
If Comcast is your internet provider, your router may now be set as a WiFi hotspot. A representative from Comcast said, "this is a new feature which Comcast has enabled by default." Check out the link below, and your account to verify. If you care about your personal information, giving a paid feature away for free, or internet speed, I highly recommend you disable this feature.
