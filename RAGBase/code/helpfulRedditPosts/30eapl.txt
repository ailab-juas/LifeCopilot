YSK about YouTab, a website that turns YouTube videos into chords

content:
This site seems to be using an algorithm to extract the chords from YouTube videos. In most cases it does a decent job. There's a fix button that allows you to improve on the content and lyrics are supported to some extent.

While they still have some work to do it seems very promising and is a useful tool for aspiring musicians.
