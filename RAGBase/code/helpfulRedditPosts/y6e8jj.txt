LPT: When you learn someone is grieving a recent loss, just say "I'm sorry for your loss" and then shut up.

content:
The chances if you adding even a tiny bit of significance to your well-intentioned condolence is approximately zero. However, the chance of saying something offensive or outright stupid are significantly higher. So just say you're sorry for the loss and then shut up.

No you don't know what they're going through because you also lost a loved one. Or your pet Fluffy died. No, you didn't have the emotional connection to the departed the way the other person did.

You'll be tempted to say what a wonderful person/pet they were, or some other flattering observation. You'll want to use words to expand on a point and wax poetic. Just don't. You'll end up waxing idiotic.

Remember the formula: Condolence + shut up== faux pas avoidance and social grace achieved.
