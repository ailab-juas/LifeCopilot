LPT: Turn the sound on your TV to 'night mode' (sometimes called dynamic range compression).

content:
This normalises the sound, so you don't get parts which are much louder, like explosions, or quieter like dialogue. 

That means you'll be able to hear everything without worrying about waking people up. The idea is the more constant sound is less disturbing.
