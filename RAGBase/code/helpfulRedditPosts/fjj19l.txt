LPT: A lot of people give good advices to people but they rarely look at themselves from a third point of view. If you're ever feeling down, try giving yourself a therapy session!

Edit: I understand I could've phrased it different so my bad on the wording. Obviously, you can't solely rely on yourself for therapy and seeking help from a professional is highly recommended.

This LPT was mostly just to encourage people to take a step back and look at the situation from a different perspective. There's people that would give up easily on their problem but would give helpful advice to a friend in a similar situation.

Edit 2: You're not using this method to completely uproot a tree of problems. You're taking a step back to look at the tree as a whole and maybe trimming away a couple of twigs or catching and acknowledging leaves that are falling.
