LPT: If you’re having a bad mental health day and cannot do something nice for your brain, do something nice for your body.

This is the one self care tip that has helped me a lot in my struggle with mental illness. If you’re depressed, angry, anxious and it ruining your day and you know you need to use positive self talk but can’t manage it. Forget your brain for a bit. Do something nice for your body. I like to take a shower but throw in some extra nice things like, shaving my legs, exfoliating, using a nice smelling thing, putting on my favorite shirt after, eating something you love after. Etc. it not only distracts you, but it helps to show kindness to yourself when it’s hard to do it in your brain. This also works vice versa. Having a sick day and it’s getting you down? Do something nice for your brain. Watch your favorite show, make yourself laugh with some memes etc. this may seems obvious to others but it’s really saved me in times I was at rock bottom.

Edit: thanks for all the karma that’s wicked cool. Also I know a lot of you are saying this takes energy you don’t have, but it can be something as small as taking a nap, taking your meds, drinking a bit of water. I hope soon the universe throws you a break and you can catch a glimmer of good. In the meantime, I implore you too seek therapy if you have access and look and try out some coping mechanisms to help you through. As fruity as it sounds, there will be better days in the future, stick around to greet them.
