EDIT: Comments make it seem like this is all you should do. This is not meant to be a one-stop solution for phishing. You should ALSO be doing the following if you want to prevent phishing.

3. Try to enter the website by manually typing it in if you can
4. Enable two-factor authentication

Just ONE tip. Not a comprehensive guide to prevent being phished.
