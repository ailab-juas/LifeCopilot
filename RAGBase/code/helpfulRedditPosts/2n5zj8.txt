LPT: How to get your dog to stop pulling on the leash

content:
If you have a dog that pulls at the leash and you want him to walk by your side, practice swinging the free end of the leash in an arc or circle just in front of you as you walk. Your dog might get whacked on the nose by the leash a couple of times, so don't swing it so hard that it will hurt him. You really just want to surprise him.

My dog was a crazy puller when I first adopted him, especially when he saw other dogs. He was also full grown, so he needed remedial help. I had to work with him for a while to get him to stay calm when he saw other dogs, which involved a lot of redirecting his attention. Swinging the leash helped keep him focused on moving forward instead of having his head to the ground looking for every new and exciting scent that might be out there. Now he's calm and can walk easily by my side, even when other dogs are barking at him and crazy. 

I started using this technique with a huge dog that I was fostering who didn't know how to walk on the leash and was a terror to walk. He broke a gentle leader and chest harness with all the pulling. I would come home with blisters on my hands, and I hated walking him. I was at my wits end. One day, we were walking in the woods, and I picked up a stick and started swinging it right in front of me, and he wouldn't walk past it. Best walk we ever had!

Edit: There are lots of great training methods being discussed in the comments. Dogs are not one-size fits all, and my approach definitely won't be for everyone. This is just a method that I found that works for me, and my well-behaved dog is proof that it works. It's awesome if you have a different technique that works for you -- share and help out other dog owners!  I got my dog from a shelter, and he's such a wonderful guy. I don't why he ended up in the shelter, but I do know that not being able to walk on the leash is a huge behavioral problem. I just hope that some of the information here might help out another dog owner.
