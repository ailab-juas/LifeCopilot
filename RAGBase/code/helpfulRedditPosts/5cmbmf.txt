YSK On Monday, 14 November, the moon will be the biggest and brightest it has been in more than 60 years

content:
At 8:09PM GMT, the moon will pass by the Earth at a distance of 356,511km â€“ the closest it has passed the Earth since 1948. As it does so, it will be a full moon, making it a particularly big supermoon. Supermooons are roughly 30% larger in area and 30% brighter than the smallest full moons.
It should be a great time to get outside and gaze at it or take some photos.
