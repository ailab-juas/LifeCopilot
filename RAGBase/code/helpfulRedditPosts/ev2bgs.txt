YSK the signs of being emotionally abused.

content:
Emotional abuse is sadly both damaging and overlooked. I'm not a professional in any field, but I've been emotionally abused all throughout my childhood and strongly advocate for spreading the word about it. It's a horrific thing to undergo, and even worse, you may not even realize you're being abused. Here are some signs:

1. They (the potential abuser) yell and/or curse at you.
2. You feel scared of them even if they've never physically harmed you.
3. They threaten to leave/hurt you/hurt themselves if you do something they don't like.
4. They call you mean names (stupid, ugly, fat, etc.).
5. They make cruel jokes about you.
6. They manipulate you by crying and/or guilt tripping you.
7. They covertly say mean things about you (Ex. "Should you really be eating so much?")
8. They don't allow you to/don't like it when you hang out with friends.
9. They don't allow you to wear certain things/makeup/hairstyles. 
10. They constantly take their anger out on you even when you did nothing wrong.
11. They ignore your achievements and/or put you down for them ("You got a 95 on the test? Why can't you get that score on your other exams?")
12. They gaslight you (denying reality and making you question your own sanity as a result).
13. You feel as though you have to walk on eggshells around them.
14. You're afraid of them. 
15. They make you feel worthless.
