LPT: Using only half an avocado in a recipe? Cut it around the middle instead of lengthwise to reduce browning and spoilage.

content:
I don't eat enough at a time to use a whole avocado so I cut it in the middle instead of along the length. Less of the fruit is exposed to the air and the pit helps protect a lot of the fruit from browning (Where it covers).

If you eat the fat end first, you can scrape the skin out and make a cover for the exposed in as well, or just use plastic wrap.

This goes for any fruit that browns easily. You want to reduce the surface area exposed.

Edit: I get it guys, you're all practically religious about your diets. I will continue to eat as I am, though. I am doing just fine with what I am doing. I'm not going to debate personal preferences as far as dieting goes. It's pointless. There are many right answers.
