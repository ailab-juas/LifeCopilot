LPT: How to clear your car of snow in seconds

content:
I just watched a girl in my apartment complex in CO do this. We're getting tons of snow here, beginning late last night and continuing until who knows when.  Anyway, she put a tarp over her car last night by closing it in the corners under the hood and trunk (clips avoided).  This afternoon when leaving, all she had to do was pop the hood and trunk, pull the tarp off, shake off the ice/snow, put it back in her trunk, and drive off. It took her less than a minute and if you know snow is coming, you can just put it over the car the night before as you come home from work. I thought this was genius.
