title:
LPT: the "make your partner look good" rule applies to almost any situation, even when your "partner" is your opponent in a conflict.

content:
Whether you're right or wrong, others are more likely to side with you when you make both parties look better than if you were to just throw the other person under the bus.



Edit:

Referring to one of the rules of improv. Though it's a "rule" in many other forms as well.

Not referring exusively to significant others - hence the quotation marks around partner.

Also not suggesting to not report abuse...
