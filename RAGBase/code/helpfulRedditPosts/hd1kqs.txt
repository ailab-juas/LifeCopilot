YSK instead of trying to find the silver lining in a bad situation for a friend or constantly offering advice, shutting up and listening can help someone much more.

content:
Being there for someone to vent and just get out their emotions can be much more helpful than trying to fix it. Usually that person will make it clear if they want advice. And more often than not a person will feel better just having someone there to listen patiently and attentively. Especially for someone going through grief. Everyone deals with their problems differently but sometimes all you need to do is be present in mind for them.
