LPT: Not everything has to have some higher purpose, doing things just for fun is just as good of a reason as anything else.

Growing up, i was constantly re-enforced that I was either working towards something better or wasting my time. Now that I am 22 and recently got into streaming (not plugging because that's not the point here), I constantly have to remind myself that I do this because its fun for me, not because I am hoping to be "twitch famous" or anything like that.

Always remember that learning or doing something for the sake of wanting to learn/do it is just as good as any other reason.
