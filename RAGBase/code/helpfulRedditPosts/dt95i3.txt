LPT: For anyone starting/already in college, make a multi-year plan about what classes you will take and when in order to graduate. Plans will change every semester, but keeping it updated will keep you organized and make sure you get all your credits.

This will also help you keep track of what classes you have already taken, help make sure you balance out your course load so that you don’t end up having to take an insane amount of hours senior year, and make registering for classes each semester less stressful!

Edit: a lot of people had a good sub-tip — if you don’t know which classes you should take or want to make sure your plan is effective, talk to your advisor! Not only will they offer good feedback and advice, they’ll probably also be impressed with your initiative compared to the other students they have to coddle through getting a degree
