LPT If you have to make a presentation in front of a group of people volunteer to be the first one up as everyone else will be so nervous about their own presentation that they won't pay attention to yours and will more than likely forget any mistake or stupid thing that you might do.

EDIT: ATTENTION! I have received some messages referencing studies done on the primacy effects and recency effects that say that my LPT is scientifically entirely untrue. I will let you decide for yourselves however:

I personally tend to hold the first speaker as the more dominant and would be more forgiving of any mistakes simply for the fact that they took the pressure off of the group. I also would, as I mentioned, be so nervous about my own that I wouldn't be paying much attention to anyone else's presentation until my time came up.  It has definitely been interesting to see both sides of the opinion though.
