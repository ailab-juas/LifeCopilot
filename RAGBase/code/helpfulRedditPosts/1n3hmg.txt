LPT: Set Your Alarm Tone To Something Gentler!

content:
For as long as i can remember, my alarm tone was loud and obnoxious, how can you not wake up when your hearing some sort of siren, or atomic alarm, loud classic beeping?  Anything that will stir you awake.  Yet I have been a snooze-presser all my life.  I've tried setting the alarm across the room (i will get up, shut it off and go back to bed), Tried multiple alarm times, funny alarm names, glass of water next to my phone,but same result: irritation and lack of motivation.  So i tried something new, or rather ran into something different.  I set an alarm for "sunday funday" which is my day to get together with a local running group and just chill out have a few drinks and just see what happens.  Well i thought my typical alarm was not appropriate so i chose a cool little default french bistro type tune, and loved it the following sunday morning!  gave it a shot during the week and it was a hit! i wake up more relaxed (not as in i got enough sleep, all week i've gotten roughly  hours a night with the same morning result) and am less apt to hit the snooze button, i just sort of lay there and stare at the ceiling while the song plays out and than get up!

tl;dr instead of annoying yourself out of bed every morning, try a relaxed more enjoyable alarm, i guarantee the volume will wake you up and you will be less likely to hit snooze
