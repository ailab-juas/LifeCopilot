LPT: Straight up studying common tactics used by master manipulators is by far the best return on investment you will ever get.

A few days studying how manipulation works and exactly how they do it will save you months, years, even decades of getting beat down by people you can avoid or outwit.

It will help you immensely in business and negotiation; it will help you understand and evaluate politicians, it will keep you out of cults or coercive control; it will keep dangerously trash people out of your life or at least minimize their fuckery; and it will alert you to life-threatening situations. You'll be able to **kick people trying to screw with you to the curb so hard they bounce.**

*And it will change your perception of yourself in an incredibly positive way.*

Knowing you’re no longer stuck taking a target on your ass to a gun fight makes a huge difference in how you perceive yourself as competent, confident, and in control of some of the very few things we can control; how much control you give up to others, and who you let into your life.

A couple of good books on the topic are; The 48 Laws of Power (it’s the classic manipulator’s playbook; **read it defensively**)

The Gift of Fear (deals with imminent threats)

Not sure it’s kosher to link to these books so I didn't but they are very easy to find.
