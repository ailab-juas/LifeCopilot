[This infographic gives a nice clear summary of which supplements are worth having, and which are just a complete waste of time.](http://i.imgur.com/eA7Hxzp.jpg)

Edit: Thank you to /u/yishanwang for pointing out the interactive version of the chart, which can be [found here](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/)

2nd Edit: As many people have correctly pointed out, this chart is true for the *average individual*, assuming a good diet. Everybody responds differently to every drug, including vitamin supplements, especially if they are in poor health, or have a vitamin deficiency. What is true for the general healthy population is not necessarily true for you. If you have any real concerns regarding your health, of course go see a GP or a dietitian.
