LPT: The first thing you should print after purchasing a 3D printer is replacement parts for said printer

content:
That way if one piece breaks, you can easily swap it out without having to order a part. Most 3D printers have at least a half dozen parts built from 3D printed parts. Also, make sure that the first thing you print after replacing a part is another one of those parts.
