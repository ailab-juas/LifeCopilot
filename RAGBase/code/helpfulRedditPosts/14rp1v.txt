LPT: At the end of an interview, the interview will always ask if you have any questions. Ask him what he likes about working there.

I've found this to be a really great tip. It closes the interview on a positive note on two levels: it lets the interviewer talk about himself, and everybody likes to talk about himself. It also has him talking about the things that he likes, which is an inherently positive subject. By ending with this, you're helping to associate yourself with positive memories that the interviewer has.

Edit: If you are lucky enough to actually have a choice between multiple positions, the interviewer's answer will also give you a sense of whether or not the company is right for you.
