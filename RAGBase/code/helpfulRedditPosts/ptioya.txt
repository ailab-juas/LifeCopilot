title:
LPT: Never “lend” money to anyone. If someone is in need of financial assistance, and they come to you asking for money, you shouldn’t lend it to them. If you want to maintain a friendship, treat it like a gift. Can’t afford to gift the money? Then you can’t afford to lend them the money either.
