YSK that if you ever get raped, do NOT take a shower or bathe. Go to the ER and they will have a rape kit.

As much as you want to wash that memory off, the rape kit will provide proof that you dont have to wrack your brain for down the line and this can help identify that motherfucker. Evidence is your biggest weapon.

**Edit:** Um, wow. I've been awaiting for the moment where I could say "Front page of a subreddit!" And not only front page, but #1 when I checked a few seconds ago.

As expected, there are a lot of inane comments and a lot of really helpful ones. I don't think I'm God's gift to the world for this, but I just wanted to help people out and give them a reminder for future reference. A tiny reminder no matter how insignificant it might seem never hurt.
