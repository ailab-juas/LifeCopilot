title:
LPT-keep a running list of “gift ideas”

content:
This is something I started doing a few years back and it makes a huuuuge difference during the holidays! I keep a list at all times on my phones of gift ideas for people. Whenever I’m hanging out with someone and they mention something they really like, I add it to the list with their name. Usually it’s smaller quirky things that people get very excited that you remembered or knew about. I find it especially helpful for people that you don’t know that well but still will need to get gifts for during the holidays (i.e. my boyfriends family). Whenever the holidays or a birthday rolls around, I can just pull up the list and have several ideas already instead of sitting there trying to brainstorm what my boyfriend’s brother-in-law might like. Some gifts I leave on there permanently (like beef jerky for so-and-so), some I make a note of when I get it, and some I take off after I buy it for them once.
