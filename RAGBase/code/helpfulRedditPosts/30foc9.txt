LPT: The one thing that helped me finally quit smoking for good

content:
I decided to quit smoking four months ago, cold turkey. I threw out my remaining cigarettes and went straight to the drug store. I bought bags and bags of hard candies and gum. I stashed them everywhere. In my car, in my purse, beside my bed, in my coat pocket, at work, etc. Whenever I felt the urge to smoke I'd put a candy or a piece of gum in my mouth and start thinking about something else. Yes, it's not great for you to be eating dozens of candies in a day, but it's better than smoking forever. And plus you'll be super popular because if you're with people when a craving hits, you'll have to offer everyone a candy, and everyone loves candy. After smoking for nearly 15 years, I'm finally smoke free! 
**Edit:** a bunch of people seem to think that I've just traded in a smoking addiction for a candy addiction and that I must now be obese/diabetic/toothless. Just wanna clarify that I only used the candy for the first three weeks, at which point the cravings subsided and I didn't need the candy anymore. I did not become addicted to hard candy. **Edit part 2: I'm sorry for the click bait title!! It was an accident!!**
