LPT: Give sleeping earplugs a shot if you have trouble getting enough sleep

content:
I've been sleeping pretty terrible for 4-5 years and couldn't figure out why. I often planned my sleep in a way that I was able to get 8 hours, but I kept waking up at night or I just woke up way too early. A few weeks ago I noticed I often wake up earlier by the sounds of other people in the house, so I decided to give sleeping earplugs a shot- didn't even knew they existed. 

Last few weeks I've had multiple days where I woke up truly refreshed. Haven't felt that for as long as I can remember. I thought I had some sort of sleeping disorder, but I think I'm just a very light sleeper. I also never randomly wake up again in the middle of the night. Guess I just constantly woke up from random noises in the house, like the creacking of my bed. Never noticed it because it would be a one time sound and didn't hear it when I woke up because of it.
