YSK that the juice from rare &amp; medium-cooked steaks is not blood. It is myoglobin.

Why YSK:  There is a misconception that steaks cooked less than well-done are "bloody."  I've heard people say "I don't want any blood," or "It's still mooing."  Well the good news is that the juices are not blood.  They are different.  I'm not a biologist or anything, but it's my understanding that blood carries oxygen to muscles while hemoglobin is where it's stored.  The blood was drained out of the animal long before it hit the grocery store or restaurant.

It's perfectly fine if you prefer your steaks well-done.  That's your prerogative.  If you prefer the texture, flavor, etc... go right ahead.  However, if your reason for not eating (or at least trying) a medium rare steak is that you don't want to eat blood, then rest assured you won't be.
