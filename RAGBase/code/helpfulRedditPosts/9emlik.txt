For Science/Engineering students, hereâ€™s is a good list to start:

**[Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/)** - Mega knowledge engine and online calculator. Good for checking work and trying things out. Not free for the step-by-step solutions.

**[fxSolver](https://www.fxsolver.com/)** - alternative to Wolfram Alpha for solving math and engineering problems quickly. Large library of equations to check, edit, calculate and plot.

**[Cymath](https://www.cymath.com/)** - Nice step-by-step solutions. Math-centric.

**[Symbolab](http://www.symbolab.com/)** - Really good for steb-by-step solutions to math problems. Cymath alternative.

**[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/)** - Amazing for plots.

**[Mathway](https://www.mathway.com/)** - Cool math solver and chemistry solver. Plotting somewhat similar to Desmos.

**[Paul's Online Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)** - Lots of math formula sheets and explanations of various topics.

**[Mattermost]( https://www.mattermost.com/)**- Probably the best Slack-clone for collaborative projects and better privacy.
