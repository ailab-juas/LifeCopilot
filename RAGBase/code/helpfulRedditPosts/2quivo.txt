LPT: Pay an additional $50, $100, or whatever on your mortgage payment. You will save tens of thousands of dollars.

Example: if you pay an extra $150 to your 30 year 200k mortgage with a rats of 4.5%, you will shorten the loan by about 7 years and you will have saved over $43K in interest payments!

Pretty incredible!
