LPT: Don’t worry if you find yourself cringing hard at your past behavior. It’s a good thing! It means that you’re growing as a person!

content:
I often cringe at thoughts of my past self and old behaviors. It wasn’t until recently when I began to question “Why do we even cringe in the first place?”

When observing it as objectively as possible, we can see that all cringe is simply a strong dissatisfaction with ones behavior. This is a good thing! Because its an indicator that you want to improve yourself!

If you truly didn’t care about how your actions might affect other people, then you probably wouldn’t experience cringe from time to time. 

Next time you experience yourself cringing at your past behaviors, try to embrace that feeling of discomfort as much as you can, come to acceptance of who you once were, and then actively choose to improve yourself to become the person you KNOW in your heart you’d like to be. 

Cringe is your friend :D
