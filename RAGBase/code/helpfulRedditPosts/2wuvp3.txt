Here's the site to register for free [MEGA](https://mega.co.nz/#register)

Edit:

The service uses client-side [encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_%28service%29#Data_encryption),  that part of it is **open-source**

In their FAQ they suggest to use your own client if you don't trust them:

&gt; ***What if I don't trust you? Is it still safe for me to use MEGA?***
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't trust us, you cannot run any code provided by us, which precludes opening MEGA in your browser and entering your login credentials. However, due to MEGA's end-to-end encryption paradigm, you can safely use client applications written by someone you trust.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Why should I entrust my data to, of all people, you?***
&gt; 
&gt; We provide for user controlled encryption \(UCE\) where you, the user, control the keys. The UCE implementation is **open source**, and we invite and encourage the community to scrutinize it and provide feedback. We believe that this approach is much safer than storing your data on a provider with server-side encryption where the ISP controls the keys or, worse, no encryption at all. For example, if MEGA user files were suddenly accessible without a password due to a programming error, they would be unreadable without the user-controlled decryption keys.
