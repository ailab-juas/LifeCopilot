YSK better than to hit REPLY ALL on most group emails.

content:
Why YSK: The other people on your group email don't care that your kid can't make it to the big party or that you will bring your famous pecan pie. The sender is the only one asking. Reply to them ONLY. My email is constantly blowing up with unwarranted cc's over various teachers' and scout leaders' emails with tons of parent RE ALL messages. Also there is no need to send an email to anyone that just says "thanks!" and if you RE ALL "thanks!" you can just go to hell. 

You alone have the power to reduce unwanted emails!
