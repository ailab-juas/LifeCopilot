[A Reuters investigation found high lead levels in numerous areas of the U.S. recently.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/)

Lead can cause [severe health problems.](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/health.html)

**You can look up** [**whether your area is affected**](https://www.vox.com/a/lead-exposure-risk-map)**,** and purchase a *certified* filter to clean your water.

## Edit: Thanks to folks who pointed out that [lead paint is a major concern in these affected areas.](https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-exposures-lead)

*Edit 2: PSA, if you live in military housing,* [*the government*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-cleanup-exclusive/exclusive-us-army-forms-plan-to-test-40000-homes-for-lead-following-reuters-report-idUSKCN1LC1ZH) *did something* *following the report, so this may not apply to you.*

*Edit 3:* [*CNN has also produced a report, specifically about lead in drinking water*](https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/index.html)

*Edit 4:* ***BONUS*** \- [check if you live near a hazardous waste site (EPA Superfund)](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live)

*Edit 5: Thanks for the silver!  I will continue drawing attention to important issues* [as I have done in the past.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/4b5h3k/is_this_the_best_ever_name_for_a_ship_rrs_boaty/) /s

*TL;DR - Get it tested before you put it in your mouth, check your paint.*
