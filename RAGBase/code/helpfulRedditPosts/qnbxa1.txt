LPT: If you're asked to take a survey after a service rep/tech helps you out, take it and give them the best score possible.

content:
A lot of bs companies tie performance to those surveys and a lot of times anything other than a perfect score can mean a potential write up for that tech. It normally only takes a minute or two, but it could mean the difference in a raise or a reprimand for the person on the other line.
