LPT: Looking for some Christmas Magic? The International Space Station orbits the earth 15 times a day and can easily be confused with Santa's Sleigh by excited children in December

content:
This does require preparation. That tiny station is rarely streaking directly overhead at an ideal time, so you might need to be flexible or wait for a better opportunity in the future.


* First you will want to find some dark skies near you with a website like: http://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.


* Next, Check this: https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/ and put in your chosen location to see when the ISS passes overhead. 


* And then, a few days before, You will want to check the night sky forecast at http://www.cleardarksky.com/csk/ to check on cloud cover.

It's rare but some people will get that perfect Santa flying overhead on Chrismas Eve but for others, you can say something along the lines of "*I got a hot tip that Santa is doing his famous practice run to stretch the reindeers legs before the big night...*"
