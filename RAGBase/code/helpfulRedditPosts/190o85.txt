title:
YSK that most lilies are extremely toxic to cats, and even getting some of the pollen on their fur can be deadly.

content:
My family just lost a beautiful, seven month old kitten named Franklin because he nibbled on a lily plant. The window for treatment is only about 6 - 18 hours, and there is no antidote.  Cats are especially sensitive to the toxins in ANY part of the plant, including pollen. 


I would provide a citation, but it is something you can easily Google to learn more about. Yet, in my experience it seems many people aren't aware of it, and many common floral arrangements contain lilies without any warning about this.


Rest in peace Franklin.


EDIT: I should clarify that the reason getting pollen on the fur is deadly is because cats are very clean animals and can groom the pollen off of their fur, ingesting it. 

EDIT 2: Some have asked to see Franklin. Here is a picture of him (black and white) with his brother and littermate Theodore (orange). Thanks for the kind words.

EDIT 3: Oh fine, I'll add a source. :) More can easily be found using a search engine.

EDIT 4:  There have been five or more posts with jokes along the lines of "Oh good, now I know how to kill my neighbor's cat."  I get that it's a joke, but not really finding it funny, and plus it's already been said several times. Thanks.
