title:
YSK never to buy a protection plan from Radio Shack

content:
I work at Radio Shack and on many of our products we offer a protection plan. This costs extra depending on the ticket item from anywhere to 99Â¢ to $56 we are told to tell the customer that they can come to any store in the country and immediately receive a full refund or the product in which the customer purchased. WRONG. The customer or associate has to file a claim and if accidental damage occurs then they may not receive the credit. Might I add in store credit not even cash back. 

TL:DR don't buy any thing from radioshack with a warranty we over price it and the protection plans are bullshit

Edit: Guys im not quitting my job calm the fuck down.
