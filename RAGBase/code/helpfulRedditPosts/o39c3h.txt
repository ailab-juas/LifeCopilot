LPT: Never compliment someone for losing weight unless you know it’s intentional. I once told a coworker he looked great after he lost a little weight. He looked sad afterwards. I didn’t understand why. I found out later he had terminal cancer. I never comment on anyone’s weight now.

Edit: I’m just saying don’t lead with “you look great!” Say “wow! Great to see you! What have you been up to?” People will usually respond with an answer that lets you know if they have changed their lifestyle. Then you can say “yeah! You look amazing” 
I’m a super nice person. Not a jerk for those of you saying I’m a robot or making mean comments or saying I should have known the difference. Wow.
This man had just lost maybe 7-10lbs. It was early on in his illness. He eventually get losing weight and passed away...
So I was giving this life tip so people aren’t haunted like I am. In that moment I reminded him he was dying and I hurt him.
