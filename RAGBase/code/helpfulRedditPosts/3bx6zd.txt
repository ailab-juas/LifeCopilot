LPT: When a worker is particularly helpful or friendly to you, take the time to let their manager know. It could have a huge effect.

Story: my mom had a woman helping her at a well-known clothing store who was excellent, very helpful and friendly. My mom ended up writing an email to her manager at the store, telling her how great this employee was, how helpful, etc. The next time my mom went into the store, the employee came up and hugged her. Turns out because of that email the employee had gotten a promotion. Even if it's just telling the manager in person, it could really help that employee. I've started doing it and it is truly worth the few minutes of time to reward those often in thankless jobs. 

Edit: Glad this is my first post to make it to the front page! Thanks to everyone for your stories and ideas. :)
