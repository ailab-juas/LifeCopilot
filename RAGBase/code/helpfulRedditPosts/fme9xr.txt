YSK: With restaurants, bars, bakeries and cafes shutting down the owners will very likely let you buy their excess stock that will otherwise go to waste.

content:
You get good supplies at a decent rate, they make at least a minor return in a shutdown that might otherwise destroy their business. Win win!

Edit: seems to be a LOT of folk being intentionally pedantic or negative here. Firstly, there’s no need to be negative about someone trying to be helpful. Secondly, on the point of “excess” stock, I used the word excess as it IS going to be excess for a lot of places as they can’t sell it or use it the way they usually would. Don’t split hairs. Stay safe!

Edit 2: Stock in this instance refers to food goods and similar people, not purchasing stock in a business! But I love the enthusiasm!
