This post is a result of [THIS video](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1jk9op/no_im_asking_you_a_question_but_lapd/), which is pretty popular right now.  People seem to be woefully misinformed of their rights, and think that you must answer every single question and do every single thing a law enforcement person asks of you.
