LPT: Wash your pillowcase(s) with your clothes every time you do laundry.

content:
Many people wash their bedsheets less often than they should, which usually isn’t THAT big of a deal. However, build up of dirt, sweat, oils, etc. over time can cause issues like acne if you go too long without washing your sheets.

A small step that adds basically no extra work to your routine is to take off your pillowcases and throw them in with your normal laundry whenever you wash your clothes, so at least you’ll be regularly sleeping with your face on a clean surface. (I don’t blame anyone for not wanting to take a fitted sheet on and off all the time though)

note: this isn’t a pro tip about how often you should wash sheets. It’s a pro tip about being able to **passively** wash pillowcases without an additional time input
