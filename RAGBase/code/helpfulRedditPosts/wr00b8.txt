LPT: If your kid is starting at a new school, make sure they know their legal first and last names

content:
I teach kindergarten and I am shocked each year by how many kids don’t know their full legal names. This is particularly an issue when there are 3 kids in the same class with the same first name that don’t have a clue what their last names are. I’ve also had issues with kids not knowing their legal first name since they were always called a nickname by their families. The first day of school is challenging enough when you don’t have teachers scrambling around trying to figure out if they have the right kids. In addition, make sure they know the full name of at least one parent/guardian.
