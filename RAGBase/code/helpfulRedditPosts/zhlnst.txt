YSK what to do when someone has a seizure

content:
WHy YSK: I've watched two people have seizures in front of me in the last few weeks and both times, no one else knew what to do. Idk if the times are causing more stress induced seizures but here's what to do:

obligatory disclaimer: not a healthcare professional, just healthcare adjacent with many friends/family in healthcare. Anyone who knows better, please correct me :

* Stay calm. The moment you panic is the moment you are no longer of any help and you should let someone else handle it. You'll likely notice the adrenaline pumping when you're calling 911 and you say, "Ineedanambulancerightnow." That's natural but you're gonna need to reign it in and channel it away from full on fight or flight. 
* They'll likely fall over and you're probably not going to react fast enough or are strong enough to actually catch a free falling, dead weight human. If you can somehow stop them from hitting their head on the way down, that's already a win but don't try and catch them unless you are very confident you can do so
* Clear the area around them. Do not attempt to move the person, just the stuff around them.
* Turn them on their side so if they do vomit or spit stuff up, it'll hopefully flow out of their mouth
* Do not try to restrain them, do not put anything in their mouth, etc. Simply turn them on their side. Maybe something soft under their head so they don't hit their head more. I've been told its a complete myth that people who have seizures swallow their tongues and you're more likely to get bitten or have them chip a tooth if you try and do anything with their mouth
* Have a rough estimate of how long the seizure lasts. Most last 2 minutes or less. If it lasts longer, 5 minutes or more, that's important information that will need to be communicated later to the pros. However, if someone has a seizure, the last thing I'm doing is pulling out a stopwatch. But, I will call 911 immediately and that will help give you a rough estimate of when the seizure started. Also, take note of if it seemed like one seizure vs multiple or if the person stopped breathing at any point
* When calling 911, and this is for any emergency, the very first things you say to the dispatcher is what you need (police, ambulance, fire etc), the address, and your phone number. What you need so they can contact the appropriate responders, address so they know right away where to go, and your phone number so they can contact you if the call drops. 
* Hopefully around now, the person who had a seizure is slowly coming to. They will be very confused and be very tired. They likely will have no idea why they're laying on the ground. You'll want to do your best to get them to stay calm, tell them they had a seizure, and that you need them to not move for a little. They can sit up if they feel stable but I would highly discourage standing or walking as I've seen someone go straight back down because of how weak and light headed they were. Most EMTs I've met say no food or drink until the EMTs arrive.
* Most likely, the ambulance will not full on emergency rush to the scene. Last time I called for a seizure, it took them 30 minutes. The vast majority of seizures are single events and less then two minutes long and by the time the pros have arrived, all they're really doing is asking the person questions such as past seizure history and recommending they go be evaluated by a doctor. I still always call an ambulance because I never know what else could go wrong and I'd rather have the professionals with the truck that can bypass traffic if shit gets even worse. But, I've also driven people to the hospital myself instead of them getting in the ambulance because of the cost. 

That's all I got. Hopefully, this is helpful.
