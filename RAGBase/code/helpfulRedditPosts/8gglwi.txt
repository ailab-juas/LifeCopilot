LPT: Tired of getting the wrong size shoe because it's not the same number brand to brand. Learn your EUR shoe size. It's more accurate than USA shoe sizes.

content:
I get USA shoe size range from 9-10. But if I stick with my EUR size of 43, I never get the wrong size no matter the brand or type of shoe.  
  
Edit: precise is a better word than accurate.   
  
Also getting a lot of Nike exceptions. Don't own them so I haven't experienced that yet.   
  
But in my case and range of 10 different shoes companies and styles i.e. boots, running shoes, sneakers, skateboarding shoes. They are the same number.
