title:
YSK about the restricted list on Facebook

content:
I have one person who likes and comments on EVERYTHING I POST. This has become very annoying, but I can't exactly unfriend him, because I see him regularly at school. I went and looked at lists.

**How to do it**

Go to the person's page, and hover over where it says "Friends" with a check mark. Then click on "Add to another list..." You'll get a drop-down menu of lists: close friends, acquaintances, your networks such as "_____ University" or "(city), (State)," etc. Near the bottom of all that will be "Restricted." Uncheck any category they are already in on the drop-down menu, and then click "Restricted." [They can now only see your public posts, or things you tag them in.](https://www.facebook.com/help/www/206571136073851)

Edit: I don't see the problem with wanting to avoid conflict.
