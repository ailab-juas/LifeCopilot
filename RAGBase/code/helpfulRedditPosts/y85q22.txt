YSK: How to properly manage a 4 way stop intersection

content:
Why ysk- My daily drive involves several 4 way stops. At one intersection at least, every single day, it's apparent that one or two of the drivers doesn't understand the rules. 

This causes confusion and takes extra time for the other cars to decide who's going when whereas if everyone knew and adhered to the simple 4 way stop rules we would all be on our way while being safe. 

The main ideas are as follows:
First to arrive, first to go.
If it's a tie, then the car to the right goes first. 
Straight before turns.
Right then left. 

Always proceed with caution and never assume the other drivers know what they're doing but if everyone took the time to polish up on the rules of driving things would run a lot more smoothly!
