LPT: Never repost or share a missing person bulletin unless it was posted by the police department.

content:
I still see these things being shared and it’s terrifying, never ever ever share anything about finding someone unless the main contact is the police and it came directly from the police (or similar agency). People flee abusive relationships, are trying to hide from stalkers, are trying to stay safe from someone they had to testify against, and more. These people are tracked down by using these fake sob stories on social media that well-meaning people pass around by the thousands. Do not share, ever. 

Even if you know the person who posted it, if they reported it and the police found it credible it will posted to their missing persons board so go find that and share it. If it’s not there, encourage that person to ask the police to post it.
