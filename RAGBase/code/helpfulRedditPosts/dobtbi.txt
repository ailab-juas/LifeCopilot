title:
LPT: Don't announce to others what you plan to do, instead, AFTER the task is completed, share what you did. Addictive dopamine gets released at a better time for reinforcing productive work in the future!

content:
Psychologists claim that telling people you're going to do something and getting their approval releases dopamine without actually doing the task, becoming a major reinforcement for not following through on plans. By keeping plans more private, you hold off on release of the addictive dopamine until it will reinforce you completing goals. It's a hack for your brain. You get addicted to getting things done!

Also, for those who like to play devil's advocate, the counter argument is that public display of goals does help for them to be achieved. There is truth to this, but is mostly refuted in terms of short term versus long term change. Public announcements hold us accountable out of fear and fear doesn't lead to long term intrinsic motivation and change only short term action as the driving force in the change is external rather than internal. 

Lastly, I'm not saying not to talk through your goals with others, just be sure you're not doing it for the affirmation of setting the goal and be selective with who needs to know (hint: it's not everybody).

Edit: wow this took off

Edit2: thanks for the silver!

Edit3: I get it, dopamine isn't addictive but I can't adjust the title so yeah, there's that
