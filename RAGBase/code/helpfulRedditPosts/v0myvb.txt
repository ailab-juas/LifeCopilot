LPT: When a company interviews you for a job, make sure you interview them back as well.

content:
Best way to see if a company is full of shit or not, is to challenge them on the questions they ask you (not immediatelly of course - first answer their questions and at the end of the interview flip them on their head).

For example, if they ask you "why do you want to work for us?", ask them what makes them so special (phrase it better though). If they ask you about your sales achievements, ask them about their sales team figures. If they ask you how you would represent their values, ask them how does their team represent their values every day. Companies with good structure will have good answers. Companies that have no good answers, will probably throw you in a pile of shit and expect you to sort it out.  


I recently interviewed for a company that is big on sustainability, and they grilled me about what I've done for sustainability, recycling etc, and when I asked them back what they're doing daily within the company, they had no answer. The person that eventually got the job is a connection of mine on Linkedin, and just this morning they messaged me that they handed their notice on Friday because the company is a mess.
