LPT: If you share a bed with someone, you both should have your own blanket

content:
I believe having two blankets saved my relationship lol. We used to share one big comforter and it was a constant battle of who was covered more each night. Since we've switched to two separate queen sized blankets there have been 0 issues. Plus I run hotter so I get to use a thinner blanket vs him having a heavier plush blanket. Life is much better with two blankets!
