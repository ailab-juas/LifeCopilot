YSK: Yes you absolutely do need to test your smoke and CO detectors regularly

content:
WHY YSK: we depend on these detectors to keep us alive in the event of a fire or malfunction.  They are reliable enough and the beep is unpleasant enough that most of us neglect testing them.

I recently tested my smoke detector and it didn't work!  It was only four months old, and it was one of those with a 10 year lithium battery.  Of course I got it replaced under warranty.
