title:
LPT : stay away from *that* older guy

content:
mainly directed to teen girls/ young adults (15-20 ish):
that older guy who thinks you're 'mature' is lying to you. he knows you're young and finds you vulnerable. stay away, there's a reason they don't go for girls their age.
disclaimer: once you're above the age of consent, its fine to sleep with those also above age. I'm on about very specific people who prey on teens or new adults who can't spot the red flags.
