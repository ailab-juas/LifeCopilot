YSK: If you don't have access to Dramamine for motion sickness you can substitute Benadryl to reduce the symptoms.

Dramamine is great for motion sickness but not always readily available. Benadryl is a very similar type of medication and more commonly on hand. Benadryl doesn't last as long, but should take effect more quickly.
