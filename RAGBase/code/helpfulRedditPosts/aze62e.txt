title:
LPT: if you have a basil plant take the small fresh leafs first and not the big old ones.

content:
This tip comes from a friend of mine who is into growing a certain kind of recreational plant. 
I usually did it the other way around, taking the big ones first to make space for the small ones. Turns out the other way around is much better.
The big leafs are basically the main power source of the plant. Taking all of them weakings the plan and it will slow down the growth. 
Takingthe small ones will declutter the plant and make space for more small leafs. 
(This just applies to a heavllily used plant, not a fresh one where all leaves are big) 

Edit: 
As many pointed out, this is not ment to be a tip for growing weed. 

Additionally I have to add, it's true, if the big leaves take all sun from the small ones, take some of them out as well. This tip is ment for already harvested basil plants, with some big leaves and a lot of small ones coming. Like many I always thought, the big ones are "ready" and make space for the small ones. In this situation rather take some small ones than big ones, and help the plant grow back faster.
