LPT: When feasible, remember to follow the rule of “two is one; one is none”

content:
This is a concept that I learned in the Marine Corps about a decade ago, and following it still in my civilian life has saved me from measurable stress. 
Traveling overnight night? Bring an extra pair of undergarments. Going camping? Bring an extra ferro rod. Practicing safe, consensual sex? Bring two condoms. 
There are plenty of examples that this LPT can be applied to.
