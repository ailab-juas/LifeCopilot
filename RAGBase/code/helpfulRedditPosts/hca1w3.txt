title:
LPT When moving put everything you will need the first 24 hours in a separate box.

content:
Label this box "Important!" or "Open first!". Don't let this box out of your sight until you reach your new location. And then put it somewhere away from the rest of the boxes. Include a towel, shower curtain, sheets, a cup, plate, spoon, a set of clothes, toothbrush, shampoo, medications, phone charger and lysol wipes. This way if you don't get to anything else that day, you can at least shower and go to bed without digging through all your boxes.

Edit: Adding toilet paper per request. Also holy moly I'm so excited 100 people think I have half decent advice. Thanks for the up votes guys

Edit: 200 this is so fun

Edit: Aparently reddit it awake when I'm not. Thank you!
