YSK that internet providers sell speeds in bits and not bytes(the typical unit of data transfer speed you're used to)

content:
Why YSK: Oftentimes when you're purchasing or signing up for new service at a certain speed, like 1 gbps, you might think this means you're transferring 1 gigabyte of data per second, when this is actually not the case.

You begin downloading a file and notice the actual transfer rate shown on your device is 110-130 megabytes per second. Some shrug it off, but some may be confused and upset that this isn't the speed they purchased.

What you're purchasing is speed in megabits and gigabits. And bits are smaller units of data than bytes. 

There are 8 bits in 1 byte of data. So for every megabit of speed, you're only getting .125 megabytes per second. 1 gigabit, you'll get 125 megabytes per second.

This is just good information to better understand what you're buying and why it translates the way it does in your everyday use, downloading and uploading files/data.
