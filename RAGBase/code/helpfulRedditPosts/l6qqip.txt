Why YSK: Many of us college kids got screwed out of the stimulus payments because we were claimed as a dependent in 2019. If you meet the requirements for a stimulus check and were independent in 2020 you can file for a Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 tax returns using a 1040/1040-SR tax form. The worksheet to see if you qualify is here: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf) (page 59)
