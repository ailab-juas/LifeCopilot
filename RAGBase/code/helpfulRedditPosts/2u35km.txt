LPT: If you crack an egg and some shell falls in, use the sharp shell half to scoop it out. It wont slip about like it does on forks or spoons.

Edit:  Some other good alternative suggestions coming from this is to wet your finger, and to crack the egg first on a flat surface to make an even split. I like to use the shell because it's fast.
