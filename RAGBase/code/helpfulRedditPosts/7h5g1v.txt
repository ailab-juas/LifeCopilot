LPT: To always know out whether to say “Billy and I” or “Billy and me”, remove the “Billy and” portion and say your sentence to see if it sounds right. “Billy and I went to the store” bc had Billy not been there, I went. Not Me went.

Edit: obviously my grammar isn't that great by how i added an extra word in the beginning! You get the idea!
