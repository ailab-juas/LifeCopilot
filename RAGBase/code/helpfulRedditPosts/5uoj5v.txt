LPT - When you have an item you changed your mind on at the grocery store (especially perishables) just give it to the cashier. We really don't mind and you don't have to be sorry about it. It makes everyone's lives easier and we won't have to go through the store looking for misplaced items.

edit - RIP my post replies !! I'm glad everyone liked the LPT. I know some cashiers will give you a hard time about it but the majority of us really don't mind... and as people said. Do this at ALL retail stores! 

Edit 2 - wow front page and more upvotes than all my posts combined! Please please take this advice. If your cashier is mad about then they can screw themselves because it's not even their job to put it back! Grocery stores have people for that!
