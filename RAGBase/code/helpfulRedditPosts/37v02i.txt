YSK how to get rid of "Sign up to see this page!" popups

content:
A lot of you computer people probably already know this, but I didn't. Getting rid of those pop-ups that grey out the screen is actually really easy. Just right click and go to "inspect element".  Then hover over the pop-up and you'll see the corresponding html down below. Delete that line. Do the same for the grey background. Enjoy!
