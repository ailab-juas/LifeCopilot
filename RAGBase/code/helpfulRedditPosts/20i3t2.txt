YSK that if your Mac trackpad has stopped clicking, it may be because of a swollen battery. This is covered under Apple's quality program, even if your device is out of warranty.

I went to the Apple store to change my battery, and was notified of this. I was prepared to pay for a new battery since the laptop is over 3 years old, but the technician told me that it was all covered under the quality program. Free new battery.

Edit: Mine is a 2011 MacBook Pro. 
This is not a guarantee that your device is covered. I am simply saying that if your trackpad isn't clicking as it should, it's because of the swollen battery, and that is likely covered under Apple's quality program.
