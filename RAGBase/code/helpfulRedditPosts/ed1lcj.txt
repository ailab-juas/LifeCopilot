Blue cross blue shield offers a wellness program that is $25.00 a month (and a one time $25.00 enrollment) that gives you access to thousands of gyms for that inclusive 25 dollar fee.  No commitments. Be smart about your wellness and I encourage everyone to hit their wellness goals! I believe in you!

Edit: Gold? Bless you sir/madam. Happy 2020 fitness goals to you! AND silver? Making me blush.
