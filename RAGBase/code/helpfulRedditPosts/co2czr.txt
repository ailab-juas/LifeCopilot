LPT: Make a recording of your voice with a sweet message or telling a story. If anything happens to you, your loved ones will greatly appreciate being able to listen to your voice again.

Thought of this because  I recently found a recording of my grandpa telling me one of his stories from when he was a cop. Watching my grandma's reaction when she was able to hear his voice again years later... Everyone needs to do this for their family. You never know when something might happen, but especially older people and sick people need to do this. 

And I know people have mentioned saving voice mails before, but having a story or a personalized message is so much better than a random voice message. People don't think about when they are going to die, and not everyone may think to save a voice message from you. Do this for your loved ones. Put it on a flash drive and label it, make sure it is somewhere your family can find it. Your loved ones will greatly appreciate it.
