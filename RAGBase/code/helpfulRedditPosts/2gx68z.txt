LPT: Find a "fake" version of your engagement ring or other expensive jewelry. You can wear it in places you don't think are safe enough for the real deal.

content:
My fianc√©e likes to wear her engagement ring every day, no matter what. A problem is that we go a lot of places and do a lot of things where it's not ideal to be wearing expensive jewelry. For example, going on difficult hikes, going to the beach, doing more rugged travel.

I found a pretty easy solution: I bought a fake engagement ring that approximates her real one. The real one is white gold and diamond. The fake is CZ and silver; it only cost about $25. Now she's able to wear a ring everywhere without putting the real one in danger.

(Let's not turn this into the debate over diamond rings - I know there are strong opinions about it on Reddit. That's not what this post is.)
