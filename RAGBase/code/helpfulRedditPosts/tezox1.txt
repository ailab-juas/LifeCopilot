YSK:some animals "park" their babies while they go off and eat all day.

Why YSK: spring is coming, that means baby animals. That means baby animal "rescue" videos. In some of these cases its actually the worst thing you could do!

What YSK: some animals like deer and rabbits "park" aka leave their babies in a safe sheltered place like tall grass, shrubs or shallow dens while they spend the day eating elsewhere. 

What should you do if you come across a baby animal and no mama? In most cases unless the baby is visibly injured or distressed leave it alone! You should Google the animal, read about the habits of that animal and its babies. Assuming there is no need for immediate intervention leave it for a day or so. If after that time nothing has changed then you should contact a local animal expert. If the situation seems like it needs intervention, take percautions and only intervene if you can actually help or get the baby to someone who can.

Edit to add: taking a pic is fine. Handling/touching the animal to take a pic is not fine. It has nothing to do with human scent being left behind and everything to do with not letting the animal get used to human contact. That can be dangerous for it later if it approaches humans on its own. Not all humans are benevolent.
