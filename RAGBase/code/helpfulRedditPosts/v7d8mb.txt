LPT: it takes practice to enjoy being alone. Take small steps.

content:
back then, i’ve noticed that i couldn’t go out to my favorite places alone such as a local restaurant. tbh it got anxious wondering what other people thought. I started with going to places solo maybe once a week.But with time, i soon found out that it only gets better with going out alone. You get time to be comfortable with yourself
