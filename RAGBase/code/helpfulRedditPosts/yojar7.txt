LPT: Whenever someone you know and like mentions something they'd like to have, write it down. Then, when you need ideas of what to get this person as a gift, you've already got a list of ideas

Keeping notes written down about people you know might seem weird or creepy, but it comes in handy to already have a list of the kind of things that someone doesn't have but would like getting. I have a bad memory, but keeping a list that you can regularly update year round is a life saver when it's time to start thinking about birthday or christmas gifts.

 Even if the things on the list are altogether way out of your price range, it'll still give you somewhat of a guideline of what *kind* of stuff they like.
