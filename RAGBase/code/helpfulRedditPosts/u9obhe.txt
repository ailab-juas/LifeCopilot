YSK: When looking around homes to purchase ALWAYS check cabinets and closets

content:
Why YSK: When homes are done up for sale, many people do a “lipstick on a gorilla” job. In other words, applying fresh layers of paint, new carpets, etc to cover up flaws in the home which could cost you later on. 

I’m an architecture student in a family of property developers, so I’ve been in many open houses ranging from 100,000 to 3+ million. In many of these homes, I’ve opened cabinets to serious mold issues, ripped electrics, rotten wood, and once I even found an active beehive. 

It’s a simple thing to do, but many people overlook it. Please, when buying a house make sure to get a good look of the entire property, including closets and cabinets.
