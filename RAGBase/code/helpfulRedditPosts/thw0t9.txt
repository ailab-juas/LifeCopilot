YSK: If you catch a mouse with a glue trap, you can use vegetable oil to free them.

Why YSK: 

So a few years ago we had a mouse in our pantry.  I was living at home with my family and they ended up purchasing sticky traps for the mouse. 

I’d like to insert that if you have an alternative for more humane methods, please do it. 

I came downstairs one day for some food, opened the pantry and saw this little dude/dudette stuck… on his side and his little chest was breathing so heavy.  It broke my heart. 

I immediately started looking up how to save little man and discovered that vegetable oil would help get my mans off the trap safe.  So I go outside and take a cup (to catch him in after) and poured a little on his booty.  I sorta poured it slowly in spots that could get all sides of him, just be sure not to pour it on their face and not to drown them lol. 

Anyhow, Tom was able to slide off the trap and I kept him in a red solo cup and walked him into the field in my back yard and let me walk out on his own pace.  He walked to the edge of the fence and looked at me then took off.  I’m convinced he thanked me because there was no telling how many hours he was pinned down against that trap. 

Luckily - we haven’t had any mice in my life except that, but going forward I would definitely use something that could do less harm to let the little critters keep their lives.  

Anyhow.  Hope this helps!

Edit: This isn’t advice on how to deal with mice. But something you should know in case you don’t want to kill.  Y’all need to relax in the comments… my instance was a single mouse - not a subway full of rats.  Chill out hang. It’s just Reddit.
