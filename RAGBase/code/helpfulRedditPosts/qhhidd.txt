LPT: if your SO is never in the mood for some sexy time, ask how you can help them relax. Stress is the #1 sex drive killer.

Edit: flair added.

Edit #2:  this tip is not meant to help trick your partner into having sex with you again! In a relationship, you should be a team and helping your partner RELAX so they have enough free headspace to develop lust and desire again is the goal, but it’s still not a guarantee! Please don’t use any favor done for your spouse as blackmail to trick them into sexual actions!

Edit #3: thanks for all the love and the awards!! And the 69 comments… :D
