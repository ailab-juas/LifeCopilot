title:
LPT: Microwave food on half power for double the time

content:
If you find that heating food in the microwave either produces a dish with fridge cold bits or other parts hotter than the sun, try setting your microwave to 50% power and doubling the time you heat it for. 

This way the food will be much more evenly heated. 

This also applies if you find microwaving food makes it too dry.
