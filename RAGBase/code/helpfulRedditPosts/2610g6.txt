LPT: Get gum out of hair without cutting. Cooking oil.

content:
Coat the afflicted hair and gum with cooking oil.  My kindergarten son got a gift from a girl that likes him.  She put gum in his hair.  It was matted pretty bad when I picked him up. I thought for sure we were cutting it out, but his awesome MacGyver Mom found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6hXiKW1JSg) on youTube and it worked perfectly.

This was posted a year ago and only got 10 up votes, so I thought I'd share.  I hope I am not just terribly ignorant of some silly common knowledge thing.
