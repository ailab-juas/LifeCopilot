I recently had two great experiences with different customer service reps and I proceeded to ask to speak to their manager so that I could tell their manager how good of an employee they are and I recommended them for a raise I don't know if they will get a raise or back to help so much but I like to send the Positive Vibes and hopefully help them stay at their job and maybe even get a little raise
