YSK there’s a really good reason to obey 25mph speed limits in neighborhoods: a person is about 70 percent more likely to be killed if they’re struck by a vehicle traveling at 30 mph versus 25 mph.

There’s a lot of research out there about this, and the risks definitely change a bit depending on the person’s age and physical condition. But on average, you have a near-100% chance of surviving a vehicle striking you at 25 mph, and only about a 20% chance of walking away ok as the car nears 40 mph.
