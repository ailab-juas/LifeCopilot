title:
YSK that roaming charges for the EU are abolished for all providers as of last Thursday

content:
In the whole EU, all your data, calling and texting will be deducted from your bundle with no extra charges for being in a different country! This regulation comes into effect June 15!

Also useful for tourists that travel around Europe: get a SIM in one country and you're set for the whole lot.

Edit: corrected date to June 15, thanks!
