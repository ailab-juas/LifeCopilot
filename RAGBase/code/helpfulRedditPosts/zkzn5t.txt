title:
YSK The pharmacy desk has the only strong nasal decongestants, everything in the aisles is weak

Why YSK: If you have nasal congestion, the medications if your cabinet probably aren’t doing much to help. 

Phenylephrine HCL is the only nasal decongestant in DayQuil/all cold/flu meds in the aisles as of 2006, and it’s incredibly weak.

Pseudoephedrine HCL is the only max strength nasal decongestant and you have to ask for it at the pharmacy counter. You don’t need a prescription. Brand name Sudafed, not Sudafed PE. (Edit: this is only for the USA, because apparently we liked to made meth with it.) 

Studies in 2006 and 2009 show Pseudoephedrine to be more effective than phenylephrine.

I’m sick AF right now and just learned from the pharmacist that the meds I’ve been taking have barely been doing anything for my stuffy nose related to cold/flu because they’re mostly formulated as a cough suppressant. This has been a game changer for my sinus pressure and nasal congestion.
