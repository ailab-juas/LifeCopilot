YSK: There are multiple websites that give you recipes based off what ingredients you have on hand

content:
You enter all the ingredients you have in your house and the sites give you a list of recipes you can make using those ingredients, super useful right now, use what you have and stay home as much as possible!

https://www.supercook.com

There are probably more similar sites, list em if you know them!

Edit: there are some for cocktails too in the comments!

Edit2: I recommend that everyone use a sharp knife when cooking. A nice kitchen knife doesn’t have to be expensive, look into utensils they use in food service and they should last you a lifetime at home and typically don’t cost too much. and please, especially now, clean everything very well!!
