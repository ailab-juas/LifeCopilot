YSK If you're in this polar vortex (or otherwise very cold winter) now is a good time to defrost your deep freeze.

content:
You can put everything outside while the deep freeze thaws out, and it won't spoil in the freezing cold. Good way to keep it ice-free so it doesn't break down on you in the hot summer months. :) Take advantage!

Edit: I did not know there was a language difference. I am in Canada so "deep freeze" is a "deep freezer, freezer, freezer-chest, chest-freezer, the super cold part of the fridge etc..." And fridge is refrigerator in case that's different.

Edit 2: If you live somewhere with a lot of animals that go through trash you're going to have to use your own judgement. I live in Canada and we have coyotes, crows and magpies mainly but they don't come out in extreme cold -40C as often. Usually frozen items that are tightly sealed won't have enough smell to lure them in after only one evening, particularly if it's very cold and they're not traveling as much. Your mileage may vary!

Edit 3: Apparently some of you lucky ducks no longer have a polar vortex! Well I live in Canada and it's "a frozen hostile wasteland, and there is much work to be done if we are to survive the elements" lol. But either way it's good advice for next time or if you live in the tundra. :)
