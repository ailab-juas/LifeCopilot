LPT: When scribbling something out, instead of scribbling randomly, write a jumble of random letters all over it. It will be almost impossible to read the original word.

content:
It works so much better, and it is almost impossible to tell what the original word/phrase was.

Edit: Holy-flippin'-cheesecakes. I can't believe I made front page on my first post.... Thanks everyone &lt;3!

Editedit: As quite a few of you have been saying, only do this when you don't want the original text to be legible whatsoever. Otherwise, especially in a work/school/exam environment, it's best to just draw a neat line through it.
