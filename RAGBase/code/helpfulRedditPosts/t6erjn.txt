title:
YSK Antidepressants can cause enduring sexual and emotional issues even after discontinuation, for some individuals, it can persist for years. It is referred to as PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction).

content:
Firs of all: SSRIs can help a lot of people, and never stop taking a medication without talking to a doctor (this can be dangerous if you don't do it right).

A set of criteria were agreed upon for each of the above conditions. Features of PSSD, PFS and PRSD commonly include decreased genital and orgasmic sensation, decreased sexual desire and erectile dysfunction. Ancillary non-sexual symptoms vary depending on the specific condition but can include emotional blunting and cognitive impairment. PGAD presents with an almost mirror image of unwanted sensations of genital arousal or irritability in the absence of sexual desire. A new term, post-SSRI asexuality, is introduced to describe a dampening of sexual interest and pleasure resulting from a pre-natal or pre-teen exposure to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

Why YSK: It is important to bring awareness to this condition, because many people could present similar symptomology to it but are often told its a result of their recurrent depressive symptoms despite not knowing about long lasting effects from such medications. Please carefully understand the risk/benefit of taking antidepressants, for some they are truly a miracle, but for others they become depressed because of their PSSD. The EMA (European Medical Agency) acknowledged the existence of PSSD, Health Canada following suit.

edit: The point of the post is not to discourage the use of SSRI, its more so to bring awareness to this condition!!!
