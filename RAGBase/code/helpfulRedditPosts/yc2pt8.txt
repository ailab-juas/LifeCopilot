LPT: Your safety is more important than someone else’s feelings. If you ever get a bad vibe from someone, do what you can to distance yourself from them. It’s better to be wrong than to be a victim.

Was walking on the sidewalk to a bar last night. A few steps in I noticed a man sitting under the most shaded area under a tree on the sidewalk about 10 feet in front of me. Normally I would have just kept walking but something about this particular situation just felt “off”. For a split moment I thought I should just keep walking where I was so I don’t come off as rude, but I decided instead to step out into the street that’s well-lit and walk that instead. The man then said “You smart for moving cause I was about to jump you.” I just kept walking and didn’t respond. He could have been joking, but with the feeling I got about him in my intuition, I believed I dodged a major bullet. Had I kept walking in the sidewalk to be “nice”, who knows what could have happened?
