Real life testimonials:

    it really revolutionizes the artï»¿ of tying the shoelace

Took me about two minutes to learn once I actually attempted to do it. Ten knots later it feels much more natural than the know I've been using my whole life.

P.S. There's a lot of other cool things on his site as well.

P.P.S. Just noticed I forgot to put LPT in the title :/
