YSK: That if you are out of shape and embarrassed to join a gym because of how people may perceive or judge you, know that most people there is either conscious/insecure about their own looks or just focused on their workout without paying attention to others. It's called the Spotlight Effect.

content:
Why YSK: Because I know a lot of people (myself included) who were hesitant to start working out because they are not in a good shape physically.

The small percent of people who actually seem to be making fun of someone who is trying to better themselves are the type of people you really should pay not mind to what they are saying anyway.
