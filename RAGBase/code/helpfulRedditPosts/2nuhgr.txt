LPT: When wearing a tie on a windy day, slip a coin down the inside of the hem to keep the tie from blowing all around.

content:
I loaned my skinny tie out... came back with a quarter on the inside of the bottom. Frickin' genius.

Obviously does not apply to ties with all seams stitched closed.

EDIT: I see a lot of people saying, "just use a tie clip". I don't like tie clips, myself. So I am offering this as an alternative.

**RE-EDIT**: I asked the person whom I thought I loaned the tie to. Turns out he never borrowed that tie. The only thing that could have made this happen was: when I moved, I had loose change in a dresser and some ties in a separate drawer. In the move the change must have worked its way down to the tie drawer and *by an act of god*, this LPT has been brought to you.
