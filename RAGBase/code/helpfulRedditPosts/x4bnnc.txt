title:
YSK McDonald’s does not recycle

content:
Why YSK: McDonalds has made it seem like they joined the fight against pollution. They replaced plastic straws with paper ones, and plastic utensils with wooden ones. But it’s all a facade…

Behind the scenes, there’s still tons of plastic being used for everything you can think of. There are no recycling bins and everything gets thrown into the same bag and into the compactor.

I should mention, this doesn’t apply to all McDonald’s everywhere (obviously)

(Also we *do* recycle cardboard at my McDonald’s)
