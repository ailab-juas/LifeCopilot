YSK: Walmart conducted an audit of their accounting system and is quietly sending back pay checks to very old addresses of former associates

content:
Why YSK: I last worked there from 2014-2015. I only worked there for 6 months and got a $13 check sent to the address I last used 6 years ago. I know it wasn't a significant amount of money to me but I've heard it being in the $200 range for employees who worked there longer. I'd like the word to be spread so former associates can get the money they are entitled to if they have moved since they last worked at walmart.
