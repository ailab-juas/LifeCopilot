LPT: If you're running late to meet somebody, and don't have a legitimate excuse, don't make one up. Their annoyance to your lateness will make them doubt any thinly veiled excuse you offer. Simply apologise, and tell them you should have left earlier.

content:
They may be annoyed initially, but at least they won't resent you for what they view as you lying to them.

Edit based on a contribution from the comments section:

'Thanks for waiting' is also an effective expression to use when you're late meeting someone. Although, only use this one if the person waiting for you already knows you'll be late.
