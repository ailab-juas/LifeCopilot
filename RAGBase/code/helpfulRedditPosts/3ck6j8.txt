LPT: When you meet someone who is shy, don't tell them how shy they are.

content:
It won't help them feel more confident, actually quite the opposite. I am a shy person myself and I think it's like telling fat people that they're fat: we know you know, you don't have to say it, it's only going to make us feel bad/angry/sad. That's just not a good way of greeting someone or making friends. At all.

What you should do instead is trying to find out more about their interests and make them feel comfortable. If there's other people with you, you should try a one-on-one approach, since it's really hard for them to speak up in front of many people. Make it more intimate and they'll progressively open themselves. Once they are at ease, try to make them interact with the rest of the group, one by one, slowly breaking the ice.
