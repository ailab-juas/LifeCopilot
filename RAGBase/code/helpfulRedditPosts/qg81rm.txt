LPT: If you can't clearly see your house number from the street in the middle of the night, neither can your friendly neighborhood firefighters and EMTs.

I'm a city firefighter and if I can't find you, I can't help you.  Lots of times seconds matter.  Before anyone comes at me with "Hurr durr just look for the one that's on fire" remember, we respond to all sorts of emergencies, not just house fires.  And if it is actually a fire, maybe we can get there while it's still small and put it out and save the house *before* it's blowing out of the windows.

Related: strategically planting bushes to hide that unsightly eyesore of a fire hydrant in your front yard defeats the purpose of putting it out in the open and painting it a bright color.

**Edit:**  For everyone **still** telling me to just look for the one on fire, that's a great tip.  But even better is finding it, getting everybody out, extinguishing the fire and saving the building *before* the fire is even visible from the street.  If the fire gets so big that it's blowing out of the roof, every living thing inside has likely already died a painful death.
  
And for everyone informing me that GPS is a thing, yes it is helpful but we still need to have visual conformation of the address before we go smashing someone's front door with an axe in the middle of the night.  Also it takes longer to use GPS when seconds matter.  And do you really want me taking my eyes off the road to look at a screen when I'm weaving through city traffic in a 50,000 LB truck?
