LPT: If you are in the process of applying for a job, please make sure you have set up the voicemail on your cell phone.

content:
My job responsibilities include setting up interviews for open positions that we have. We get flooded with applications. I call those who are deemed most qualified. Most people do not answer the phone and that's fine. But too many candidates have not set up voicemail on their cell phones and I can't leave a message. I hate for that to be the reason they don't get an interview. I will call back later and will even send an email if I have time.

UPDATE: you all have made very good arguments about contacting people via email rather than calling them (texting is not an option from our work phone). Especially since they have applied online. My boss is very old school in other areas as well. But this makes alot of sense. Thanks!
