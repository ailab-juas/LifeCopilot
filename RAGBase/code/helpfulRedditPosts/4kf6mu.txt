LPT: If you screw up at work, let your boss know as soon as you can.

content:
If you make a mistake huge or small, you should almost immediately try to let your boss know what happened and your side of the story. Do not wait until someone snitches on you or a customer confronts your boss.

Always cover yourself as fast as you can.
