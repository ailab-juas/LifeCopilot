title:
LPT - It's not your duty to care about everything

content:
This applies for everything in life really. There's too much out there and too many things going on to care about everything. Find the things that you love, make you happy and are good at and focus on those. You don't have to worry about or pay attention to things because someone thinks you should. 

It's perfectly acceptable to say "this is outside the scope of my interest, I'm not going to be giving this any attention right now" 

You just gotta be you, you're the only one who can so be you and do you proud.
