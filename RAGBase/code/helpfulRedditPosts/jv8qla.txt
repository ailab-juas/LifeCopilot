title:
YSK that the XBox One S is not the same thing as the XBox Series S

content:
Why YSK:  XBox One S is the current/old generation console; XBox Series S is the just-released version, and probably the one that Little Johnny is wanting for Christmas. What makes it worse is that they are both advertised at $299 at various retailers.

This is terribly, horribly confusing naming decision. I predict a firestorm of confusion and disappointment this holiday season...
