title:
YSK that Spectrum is offering free WiFi to students who don’t have access

content:
Since everything is online now, Spectrum is offering 60 days of free access to any students who don't have access to internet/can't afford it right now. If you qualify, you can call the toll free number 1-844-488-8395

edit: this is for people who literally cannot afford internet. if you can pay for your internet, then chances are you don’t qualify.
edit 2: I am not trying to promote spectrum, or any internet provider company for that matter, I just want to make people aware that if you or anyone you know doesn’t have access to internet, there are options available to help:)
