title:
LPT: New parents, buy a red headlamp for nighttime diaper changes.

content:
It keeps your hands free, your night vision stays sharp, and it doesn't wake the baby.

~~Edit - My other pro tip is to get a cheap laser light show off Amazon and do a "dance party" before bath time to get all their excess energy out. If there's two of you, one can smoke a joint and really vibe lol.~~ apparently those lasers aren't safe for eyes and kids stare into them. I'll have to do some research and maybe buy a new one.
