LPT: when online shopping for black shoes (bags, hats etc) Review pics of same in lighter color before buying the black

content:
Took me way too long to learn this LPT. Seeing the pics of the beige or brown version I can distinguish the stitching, textures and details that would be obscured on dark pics. This also helps to see whether it is well made or poorly made. Doing this has saved me from some really bad purchases!
