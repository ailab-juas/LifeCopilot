LPT: The costs of buying a home from a first time home buyer.

content:
Disclaimer: Some of this may be regional (appliance deposits, I'm in Louisiana) research is key. 

I'm 29, married and just bought my first home. Please do not go into this blindsided. 

So when buying a home with a realtor you do not pay them, they are paid by the seller once you close. Our realtors were amazing, they weren't from a major firm. Even since we've closed they've helped us move appliances in and so much more. They're doing it so that when we go to sell, they know we will call them first.      

Good-faith deposit - paid when you make an offer, tells the seller you are serious, does not always apply, can be between 0-$1000+     

Inspection - $300-$500 this is to make sure the home doesn't have defects. If they are found you can ask the sellers to fix them, they may say no. 

Appraisal - ~$500 checks the value of the home against other homes in the area most similar to yours. Some banks may not finance the home for more than the appraised price, the seller may choose to drop to the appraised price or they may not. If it appraises for higher than the selling price, you do not have to tell the seller.    


Closing costs - ~3% of the selling cost of the home. I just closed at $198k and our closing costs were ~6k. You can see if the sellers will cover some costs. We got them to cover 5k of them. Your realtor will be able to negotiate this. 

Look out for PMI which is a mortgage insurance. I didn't have to pay this because I am on a VA loan.   

What is escrow? Escrow is when they take your homeowners insurance and property taxes and roll them into your monthly payment. Our mortgage is $860/mo, but the escrow brings it to $1100. 

Also shop around for interest rates. We got a 3.25% which saved us a ton of money.

Here's the fun. You've bought the home and want to move in.

Here is what we needed.   

Electricity - May require a deposit, if you had power before you may ask for a letter of credit to waive the deposit.    

Water - requires a deposit.    

Sewage - requires a deposit.    

Gas - requires a deposit.    

Trash - requires a deposit.    

Internet - may require an activation fee, Att was running a special and waived it.    

Appliances - the previous owners took the washer, dryer and fridge. They left the microwave, oven, and dishwasher. Lowe's and Home Depot's stock is so bad in our area that we had to drive 40 minutes away and pay $1100 more than we wanted to. Our washer and dryer won't be delivered for another two weeks. Not to mention a lawnmower, which they only had one in stock and we had to buy one so the HOA wouldnt fine us. In total we spent $4600 on appliances and lawnmower because of shortages due to covid.    

We started with about $7200 in savings and are down to about $800 from everything we had to pay.   

Our neighborhood offers a $99 quarterly pest control and we have a home security system that costs $50/mo. If you want the remote services (in case something happens when you arent home).   

Thats not including a shed if you don't want to store the lawn mower and gasoline in the garage.   

Tldr: there is so much that goes into just buying the home that people forget about the stuff post buying the home. Good luck everyone.

Edit: MONEY DOWN some may ask for up to ~~20k~~ 20% down deposit. Because I had a VA home loan we did not have to put any money down.

Edit2: according to /u/annieisabitch : 
&gt;Blinds alone cost us $1500. No one ever thinks of blinds.

Edit3: Also look into Homestead Exemptions when buying. It can save you a nice amount on property taxes.
