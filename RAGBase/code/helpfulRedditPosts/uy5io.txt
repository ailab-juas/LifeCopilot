LPT: Drink a glass of water every morning, right when you wake up. 

content:
Keep it next to your bed, make it a habit to fill that sucker up every night. 

What does your body need after 8hours in dreamland? Water, and lots of it. You're dehydrated and you seem to be the only one who doesn't know it. 

Every morning drink a tall glass of water right when you wake up. Why you ask?

- It wakes you up. Not as good as coffee but it beats the snooze button
- Rehydrates you, sleep leads to dehydration
- You'll feel better, and almost immediately too

It's an easy practice, a healthy practice, and it helps get you going in the morning.
