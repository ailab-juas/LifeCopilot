title:
[LPT] Make friends with your buildings maintenance man

content:
Ive lived here just over a year, I usually BS with the maintenance man whenever he doesn't seem busy. So far this has rendered me:
A brand new couch for $50
unlocked my door for free when I locked my keys inside(usually$30)
heads up on single girls who move in
heads up on who smokes &amp; sells weed
and last week an 18" glass on glass umm tobacco water pipe. free.

I highly recommend you do the same. 

Edit: thanks for the up votes wasn't expecting all this. :)
