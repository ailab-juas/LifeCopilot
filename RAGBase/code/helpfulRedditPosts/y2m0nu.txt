LPT: Start a diary. It doesn’t have to be a daily thing, but writing down exciting thoughts, big memories, small memories, and little things and momements that excite you in your life, will be great to look back on, years down the line.

I’ve had a diary for 6 years now, and have made around 100 entries. It’s been great as a therapeutic tool, and for remembering moments that show you how wonderful life can be. 

It’s never too late to start!
