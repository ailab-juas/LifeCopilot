LPT: if someone offers you something you want, take it. Don’t decline every kind offer out of politeness.

Something I’ve had to grow out of that has cost me so many opportunities. Growing up with severe social anxiety I found it so hard to accept things people offered me: drinks at their houses, going on outings with people who I think are inviting me out of kindness, money, job opportunities. There is NO shame in saying yes when someone offers something and usually they’re asking because they WANT to help. Help yourself out, you don’t have to do everything on your own
