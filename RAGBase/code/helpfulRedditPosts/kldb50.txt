title:
LPT: double the size of your ziploc bag. If you need to seal something, large, get two ziploc bags and turn one inside out. Pull each bag over opposite halves of the item. Because one ziploc is inside out, the slides will stick to each other and voila, you have a double-sized bag.

Edit: apparently this LPT briefs well but execution sucks - very hard to line up the parts to connect on the two bags and the seal wonâ€™t be watertight/airtight. So the real LPT is buy a bigger effing ziploc.
