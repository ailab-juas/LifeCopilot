LPT: Take a video of your loved ones and family just to have a little memento of their voice and mannerisms. One day, you'll be glad you did.

It's been a few years since Dad died.  We did *not* have video or audio of him and are still always hoping one of his old friends will find a video or recording so that we can hear his voice again.  

Looking to spare someone else from having to deal with this one day, hopefully long in the future.
