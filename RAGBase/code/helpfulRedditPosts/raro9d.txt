YSK If your car is totaled, tell your insurance company to find 3 similar vehicles in the market for the amount of $ they're offering. You do NOT have to accept their first offer or agree to repair a car which often times SHOULD NOT be repaired.

Why YSK:

**1.)** Insurance will ALWAYS try to offer low first, sometimes leaving you with a balance owed on your old vehicle loan or leaving you unable to replace your vehicle with a vehicle of similar value.

**2.)** They may also try to force you to repair a vehicle which is so damaged that it will be nearly worthless **(or dangerous)** after the repair.

With the price of used (and new) vehicles skyrocketing, insurance companies are pushing heavily to "repair" vehicles with fire damage, frame damage, firewall damage, etc; due to the high cost of replacing your vehicle often leaving you with something unsafe and also worthless to any potential buyer in the future.


**What to do:**

**Situation 1.)** Ask the insurance company to provide you with a list of 3 of the exact same trim of vehicle, in the same condition, with the same mileage for the $ they're giving you. They will be forced to give you a proper amount, in order to replace the vehicle you were paying them to insure.

**Situation 2.)** Get an **independent estimate** from a reputable body shop, and if you believe your vehicle is beyond repair and ask the body shop if it were their car, would they repair it? If the answer is "no", then fight your insurance company because you're about to get a raw deal..and possibly end up with a vehicle that's now dangerous and also possibly worthless to any lender or any future buyer (or any future insurance payout..)
