YSK that Youtube is updating their terms of service on December 10th with a new clause that they can terminate anyone they deem "not commercially viable"

content:
"Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes

YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google accountâ€™s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. "

this is a very broad and vague blanket term that could apply from people who make content that does not produce youtube ad revune to people using ad blocking software.
