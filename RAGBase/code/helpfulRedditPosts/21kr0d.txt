LPT: If you can't figure out of it's "I" or "me," take the other person out of the sentence and it will become clear.

content:
"My brother and me are going shopping." -&gt; "Me am going shopping."
That doesn't make sense, so it must be "My brother and I are going shopping." -&gt; "I am going shopping." 


Edit: Here's the thing about this post. Being well spoken in life gets you everywhere. Correct grammar is an asset to navigating adulthood. Also, if this mistake didn't smack me in the face on a regular basis, it wouldn't have occurred to me to put one of these up. So, congratulations, bitchy commenters, on knowing grammar. Not being a dick gets you pretty far in life, too! (:
