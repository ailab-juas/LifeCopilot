LPT: Wait until you see your luggage to step up to the baggage claim carousel. Donâ€™t be THAT person. It makes it easier for everyone to grab their bags.

I see this all the time when I travel. Some airports are worse than others but it is extremely annoying when people just crowd the carousel when their bags have not even came out yet.
