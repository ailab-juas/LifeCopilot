title:
LPT: If your water gets shut off, turn off your hot water heater too.

content:
You can't use it anyway, but it'll keep running if you don't and cost you even more money you don't have.

EDIT: 

Just so I can cut down on repetitive comments: 

1.  I get it. Its a WATER HEATER not a HOT water heater. You're not original either. Go show off elsewhere.

2. Judging by votes, this is something many don't know. If you think "Don't get your water shut off" is a LPT, submit it yourself and see if anyone cares. (Hint: they don't) 

Why? Many people--my neighbor included, whom I gave this advice to originally-- are not aware of the dangers &amp;amp; are far more likely to have old or outdated equipment in their homes. 

3. Thank you all for your useless advice on paying bills. You are a unique and magnificent snowflake who deserves their own star in the sky. Bravo, you magnificent you!! Bravo.

tldr; yep. Water heater. Pay bills. Thanx.
