LPT: There's four things you need to keep your room clean: a hamper, a trashcan, a coin jar, and a file holder

content:
If you don't have a place to put things, sooner or later they are going on the floor, or a random pile. If your room is a mess right now, look around, I guarantee the mess consists of 90% garbage, clothes, papers, and coins. The only big mess-maker this doesn't handle is dirty dishes.
