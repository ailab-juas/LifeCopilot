LPT: Moving? Call your local liquor store!

content:
They have boxes that are made for handling weight, and some have handles. And best of all, (at least at my local liquor store) they are FREE.

I was moving and just gave my local place a ring, and they were more than happy to give TONS of them away. They even loaded them into my car. Some of the boxes had slots for bottles, which is perfect for loading glasses and keeping them protected.
