LPT: when taking family group photos at special events, take one with and without significant others (non-married).

content:
If you ever have a family gathering (IE: grandma’s 90th or family Christmas dinner) and people bring a new boyfriend or girlfriend and you get together for a group photo, always take two. Take one including them and another without them. Over the years I’ve been asked countless times to photoshop ex boy /girlfriends out of important family moments. 

I know it seems like a downer, but if you do it right, nobody should get offended. First take the entire group photo and then after, simply say “let’s take one more with just the family!”. This way if there is an ugly breakup with someone in the photo, you can at least preserve the good memory with a photo without them.
