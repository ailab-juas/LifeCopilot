LPT: Being highly selective about the things you enjoy does not mean you get more out of them than someone who isn't. Let people enjoy what they want.

You don't get more out of your Neutral Milk Hotel album than an Ariana Grande fan gets from hers. Elitism and gatekeeping does not enrich your life in any way, or anyone else's. There is no reason to be a jerk about things you don't like. It does nothing for you and will just make people think you're an insufferable prick. This also applies to cheeses.
