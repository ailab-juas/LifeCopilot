LPT: Always talk well about people behind their back, especially at work

content:
If you say good things about people behind their back, you come across as genuinely thinking these things and as a really positive person. It works in everyone’s favour and will boost your image! In my experience it’s helped me be more well-liked and fit in better in the workplace as well.
