LPT: drivers, if you think you are being followed, remember the rule of 4

If you have a gut feeling, weird moment or simply not trusting the car behind you, remember the rule of 4

You know like, after a weird date, that person you cut off and he is raging behind you, at night after class, after work going back home or simply not trusting that car that as been behind you since you came back from the shopping center. 

It’s a good thing to know the streets near your house, driving around a few blocks to see where you can do this rule of 4

You take 4 consecutive left turns or 
You take 4 consecutive right turns. 

So in essence, you are doing a square and coming back to the start point. 

Ex: you are going back home, this car is on your tail and something feels off. Before arriving home or you continue pass your home. You proceed to take a left turn then a left, another left and finally a left.


The probability of someone in a spur of the moment doing 4 left turns with you is extremely low, either they will fork off at a intersection, enter a driveway, park in the street, make a u-turn or simply continue straight. 

This makes you go back so you can go home without that car behind you. Helps you clear your mind of the doubts, is that car really following me. Doesn’t show where you live.

A simple 4 left or 4 right turns, doesn’t take more than a few minutes.
