YSK that if you feel depressed and feel like a therapist would just turn you away because your problems aren't 'serious enough', you should still go and talk to a professional. The feeling that your problems are insignificant is actually a symptom of depression.

Seriously, I see this misconception repeated so much all over the internet. A lot of people really believe a therapist would just turn them away. By no means do you have to be "obviously" mentally ill to seek help. Depression and mental illnesses have many ways of manifesting. 

I am here to tell you that any therapist, counsellor, psychologist etc that turns away or belittles someone that comes to them saying they're depressed should lose their job.

The DSM has the criteria that therapy is a good option when social, work, or personal life is impaired by symptoms. Even if you get good marks at school or perform good work, the feeling of drowning or struggling is an indicator of impairment, and can often lead to burnout. Managing well on external indicators says nothing about what's going on internally. 

Symptoms for depression can include feelings of anhedonia (loss of ability to feel pleasure), over or under sleeping, unexplained weight changes, declining to maintain social relationships, and a host of other things. If you suspect it is affecting you, there's a good chance you are right.  

So hopefully someone sees this post, bites the bullet, and finally sees the therapist they've been thinking about. It is very common to spend a long time 'screwing up the courage', but please definitely go sooner rather than later. 

Good luck and good health to anyone out there struggling.
