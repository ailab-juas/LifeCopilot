LPT: If you are ever bound with duct tape

content:
Raise your hands above your head and puff out your chest. Then slam your hands into your chest to break the tape off.


EDIT: A lot of people are asking a lot of good questions that I would like answered as well. I will TRY, when I get home tonight, to bind my hands in different ways to see if I can use the technique. The GF works as a server so she might not get home till late so it wont work out possibly. I'll also try to find gorilla tape but I'm not gonna drive all over hells half acre for it.

EDIT 2: Ok guys I'm back home. I was able to get the gorilla stuff and I also picked up some zipties. GF is still at work.When she gets back ill bug her about wrapping me up. I'm gonna do 10 wraps around with the gorilla first. Don't know if ill be able to get video up though, I really don't want my face up on here.

also [this video shows good examples of what I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gr6HX_IKpw)

EDIT 3: OK everyone, GF got home and I tested some stuff out:

1. zipties= Easy to break off
2. Regular duct tape 5 wraps around= Easy to get off
3. Regular duct tape 10 wraps around= No way coming off
4. Gorilla duct tape 10 wraps around (shouldn't have done this one first)= No way coming off.

I did not try anything behind my back because my wrists are burning from the hair removal I just went through.
