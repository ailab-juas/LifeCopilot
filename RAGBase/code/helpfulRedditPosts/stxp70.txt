title:
LPT: Learn and use the first names of people who regularly serve you.

content:
Know the name of your letter carrier, the person who serves you at your pizza shop, bakery, garbage man, ect. 

This is not a gimmick and you will likely not get special perks from doing this.  You will be better than 95% of their daily interactions and you will make someone else feel appreciated.

edit # 1:

I did not expect this to be a controversial LPT.  Thanks for speaking out, especially thank you to people who have worked in frontline retail jobs.  Seems like it is a mixed bag in the comments with some retail folks not liking the whole greeting-by-their-first-name thing and some seeing it as the only positive interaction in an otherwise empty day.

I am talking about trying to spread humanity and  kindness in the often impersonal world of commerce.  If you cannot 'read the room' and tell if someone you are talking to is on the more reserved side, then best not to make them feel awkward or worse uncomfortable.  And no, please do not be a creeper, that is no good either.

Edit # 2: 

From the comments, the only one consensus seems to be a universal dislike of being called your name if you are wearing a name tag.  I will update this LPT to include the caveat "Never read a name off someone's nametag, that makes everyone feel icky. If you are a boss, please do not make your staff to wear name tags."
