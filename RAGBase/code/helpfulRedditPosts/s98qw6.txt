YSK: To move your cursor to a specific position on your phone, you can (for Android) swipe on your spacebar or (for iOS) long-press the spacebar and move without lifting your thumb.

**Why YSK:** It gets annoying when you need to edit a typo and have to erase the whole word just to correct it. With this feature, you can precisely move the cursor around your typed content without having to gnash.

Edit: Bonus YSK:

• On Android, you can tap and swipe left from your backspace icon to delete whole words or sentences.

• You can tap and hold the caps lock icon and drag your thumb to any letter to quickly get an uppercase letter.
