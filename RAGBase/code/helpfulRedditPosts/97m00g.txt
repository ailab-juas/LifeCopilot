LPT: "Nutritionists","Nutritional Therapists", "holistic nutritionist", or "Nutritional Coaches" don't require any formal certification, education or training to use those titles. "Dieticians" do require it. Be careful who you accept diet &amp; nutrition advice from.

**EDIT** 
Important note to this. Only Registered Dietitians or RDNs (registered Dietician Nutritionists) are technically certified to diagnose &amp; treat food/nutrition related illnesses, diseases, &amp; conditions such as eating disorders &amp; deficiencies. 

1) Some or most people might spell it Dietitian, not Dietician. Unsure if one is correct or if its just regional.


2) YMMV. Certain countries or states likely have different regulations on this. AFAIK in  most parts of the US and UK, Nutritionists *can* get some sort of certification and higher ed training, but its not generally required, and its not as regulated as a Dietitian or Registered Dietitian.  In almost all cases, anything like "Diet Coach" or "Nutrition Coach" or "Heath Coach" or "Nutritional Specialist" are bs terms. Main takeaway from this LPT is do your research on your own country or state's rules, and be careful who you trust.


3) I'm not intending to imply that there aren't any Nutritionists with 4 year degrees, graduate degrees, or proper training. Just saying rigorous education &amp; certification is not always required, unlike Dietitian, which is a regulated &amp; protected term almost universally. I'm sure there are some great, knowledgeable Nutritionists and Nutritional Therapists out there...and some terrible quack Dietitians. Again, do your research and be careful who you trust.
