LPT: Never deal with a professional who mocks their clients on social media, even as a joke. It’s a huge red flag.

content:
I’m not trying to pick on any one profession, but the volume of real estate agents, mortgage brokers etc… I see on social media posting videos critical of or mocking their clients/customers is unreal. 

It says a lot about someone’s professional conduct and integrity if they’re willing to mock their clients publicly on social media. Don’t deal with people like that.
