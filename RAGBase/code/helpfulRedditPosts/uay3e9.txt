LPT: You have the right to both unionize and strike, and during a strike you can not be fired from your job, as long as its a planned legal strike that is non violent your workplace must re-instate you after its over.

content:
Sit down strikes where you show up to work but refuse to work are not legal, its not legal to be violent or threaten violence, so if you are striking make sure you get an attendance sheet to cover yourselves from saboteurs. Make sure everyone is accounted for.

The National Labor Relations Act is your best friend, all you need is 30% support to get a union vote. The larger the union the better. If you are in a non "right to work" state everyone must join the union, if you are in a "right to work" state make sure the union refuses to bargain for anyone who refuses to join. Let them make several dollars less, with awful hours, so they join.

Turn the tides on your employer, and document EVERYTHING so if they try to fire you, you can show that nothing changed other than union talk, or striking talk.

Edit- being fired for union is a civil offence meaning that you simply need to prove to a jury that your story is more believable than your employers story. Which is why they fight so hard against unionizing vs just firing people.
