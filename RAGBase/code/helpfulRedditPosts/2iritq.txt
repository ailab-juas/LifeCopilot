LPT. Like to play sports but have weak ankles? Stand on one leg with your eyes closed while brushing your teeth. Seriously.

Someone recommend especially this to me when I was 22 and spraining ankles every other month. I finally tried it when I was 28 and wow. My balance and ankle strength have never been better. So many micro muscles are used and it really wakes me up in the morning. I'm almost 30 now and haven't sprained the ankle since I started doing this

Edit: A lot of people have suggested better and more strengthening activities which are cool. I thought this may help some people out by doing something that doesn't add any time to your morning/evening routines. 

Ok Double edit: I do switch legs halfway through. 

Also props to the user that does this while washing dishes. I wouldn't have any dishes left if i tried that.
