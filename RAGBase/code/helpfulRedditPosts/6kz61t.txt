YSK: Use "[insert keyword] filetype:PDF site:amazonaws.com" to search a plethora of publicly available information hosted in aws

content:
Eg: [CRISPR](https://www.google.com/search?q=CRISPR+filetype%3APDF+site%3Aamazonaws.com&amp;oq=CRISPR+filetype%3APDF+site%3Aamazonaws.com)

You might be surprised by the amount of stuff that gets maintained in AWS these days.
