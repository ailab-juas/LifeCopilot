LPT: Take a picture of your car's milage before dropping it to the shop.

content:
I took my car to get the door repair (dent). Before I got out I took a picture of the car milage and battery percentage and sent it to the owner of the shop with no explanation. The shop has outstanding reviews online 2 complains of people suspecting their car being used during the repairs. When I went to pick up my car today, it had 87 more miles than when I dropped it. One mega tantrum later, I was not charged at least. 

Also, my dashcam video was deleted.
