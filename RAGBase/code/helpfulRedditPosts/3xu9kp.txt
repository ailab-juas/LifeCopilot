YSK about f.lux if you work with computers at night; it restored my circadian rythms and i no longer have tired eyes.

[This](https://justgetflux.com/) is pretty much the first *actual* app i install in any new machine (Windows, Linux or Mac).

It works in a remarkably simple way by automatically adjusting the color temperature of your screen trying to match whichever indoor lighting you may be using - blocking most of the blue light coming out of your display in the process, which is what keeps you awake.

It's a very underrated piece of free software imo; it may take you a few days to get used to it but once you do you won't even notice it's running.
 
PS: There are alternatives for Android, but i can't recall now.

EDIT: Thanks /u/kthomaszed, Twilight for Android.
