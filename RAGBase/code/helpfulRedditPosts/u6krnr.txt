LPT- if youâ€™re packing up a slice of cake in a piece of Tupperware, flip the container over and place the cake on the lid and use the container as the lid so it works like a cake display. Makes it easier to serve the cake later.

Had friends/family over for a get together and a ton of left over cake.  I bought some containers knowing I would be sending cake home with guests.
