LPT: Going on vacation? Leave a cup of ice in the freezer

content:
I recently went on a break and decided to see if there would be an extended electrical outage in which case I would have to throw away all the frozen food. 

What I did was to leave a few ice cubes in a glass cup in the freezer. In the even of an extended electrical outage, the ice would melt and re-freeze on bottom of the cup indicating that there was an outage.

Hope this helps. 

Edit:

Thanks everyone for input. Some really valuable feedback and as always, lots of people not paying attention to 'extended outage' criteria and hats off to you clowns trying to keep it real (funny).
