LPT: Screenshot/photo an AirB&amp;B listing BEFORE booking

content:
I just had a listing that said free cancelation prior to to a certain date/time. I was well within this and when I tried to cancel Air tried to insist that I only get partial refund. Thankfully I had a photo of the listing showing free cancellation before X time, without it I would have lost money because their "system says otherwise".

Don't trust them not to change details/terms after you book!
