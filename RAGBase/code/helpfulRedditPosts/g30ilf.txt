LPT: Never sign into any of your accounts by clicking a link in an email.

Even if you're fairly sure it's a legitimate email. Instead, load up a new page and go to the website yourself to log in. Anything that you would be asked to do via email you will be able to find on the main site and it means that you don't risk being caught out by a scam email.
