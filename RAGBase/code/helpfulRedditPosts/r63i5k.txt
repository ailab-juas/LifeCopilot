YSK: There is an extension that lets you see the number of dislikes on a youtube video

content:
Not sure about the policy of linking directly to things, but if you just google: "Return Youtube Dislike" you can find the right extension. It works for Chrome and Firefox.

Why YSK: apparently I have to explain why youtube dislike counts are important. Well it's helpful when you're trying to sniff out a scam, or maybe it's helpful when looking up instructional video's or DIY stuff. It's also amusing to look at youtube rewind and see how many dislikes it gets.

Basically you should know because youtube took away it's functionality and this brings it back.
