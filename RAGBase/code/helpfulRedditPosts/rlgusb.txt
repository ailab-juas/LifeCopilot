YSK: If you get asked in an interview whether you're planning on having children, you don't have to answer and you can just say no.

Why YSK: was recently asked this in an interview as one of the final questions and it was super obvious why they were asking me it. As a women in an industry that is made mostly of men, I felt slightly unfairly treated as I'm sure they don't ask men going for the role that question. I've also read that it is illegal to ask that question in some countries. Has anyone else been asked this in interviews? Or is it just me?
