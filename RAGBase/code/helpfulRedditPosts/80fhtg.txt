LPT: Need to quickly divide a number by 5? Multiply the number by 2 and move the decimal point once to the left.

content:
For example, if you need to quickly divide 73 by 5, just multiply 73 by 2 to get 146. Move the decimal point to the left to get 14.6, and 14.6 = 73/5.

Another example. Need to divide 630 by 5? Well, 630*2 = 1260. Move the decimal point and your answer is 126.


Edit: Woke up to quite a bit of exposure. Thanks all so much!
