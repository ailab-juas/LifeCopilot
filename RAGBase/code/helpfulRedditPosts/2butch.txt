[Alton Brown's cooking method](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/perfect-popcorn-recipe.html) for popcorn makes perfect popcorn erryday. The way it is cooked leaves no kernels uncooked and every piece of popcorn crispy and light.

**Edit: I apologize for the terrible recipe [this video](http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/perfect-popcorn-0101809.html) from the TV show will help.**

E2: Sorry for the arguing and the shitstorm of trolls downvoting my comments I'm a fairly inexperienced at posting and dealing w/ the masses (although I did just get my 1-year trophy..)

E3: Right now we are #126 on /r/all, thanks!
