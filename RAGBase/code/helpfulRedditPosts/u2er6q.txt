LPT When cleaning a microwave, put a cup or a bowl (microwave friendly dish) with some water in, and heat for a couple of minutes. The water will steam and loosen dirt and grease on the walls and you'll be able to just wipe the inside with a paper towel or a cloth without any scrubbing.

content:
For particularly stubborn dirt, or messy microwaves the process can be repeated. Heat water, wipe inside, heat water gain.
