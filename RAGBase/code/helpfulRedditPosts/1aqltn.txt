LPT: If you made less than $57,000 in 2012, the IRS has a list of websites that you can use to file your federal taxes free of charge (reposting this as a reminder now that we're closer to tax day)

Most of these cost between $20-$40 if you were to just go directly to them. Make sure you visit them through the link on the IRS page to file for free.  Some of these sites will let you file your state taxes for free too, make sure to read the fine print.
