YSK that the average reading age in the US is that is that of a 13 year old, so when writing something for mass communication you should keep your language clear, simple, and unambiguous

So firstly I need to say a couple of things.

I'm not picking on the US, it's just the majority of people on Reddit are from there. I'm from the UK and our reading age is lower at 9 years, so it's not a dunk.

Secondly some people try to link reading age to intelligence which just isn't the case. People with a low reading age can be very intelligent. There are many difficulties that people struggle with that can impair their reading age, but doesn't affect how intelligent they are.

Why YSK: If you want to get your message across to the widest number of people you *have* to use simple language, you can't assume everyone has the same vocabulary.

Being overtly and overly sesquipedalian can make you seem churlish, and alienate your audience. ðŸ˜œ
