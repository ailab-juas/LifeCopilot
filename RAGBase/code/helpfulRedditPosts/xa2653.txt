YSK: Amazon isn't always the cheapest route

content:
Why YSK: i saved $14 today, simply by going to the seller's website instead

a company called Lumiram, makes a brand called Chromalux for full spectrum lightbulbs that mimic the sun's light, i mention the names because the orders have different names in the picture below

lightbulbs dot com has an account on Amazon

6 bulbs with shipping was $75 which is a not terrible/not great price

but when i went to lightbulbs dot com, the exact same order was $14 less after finding a 10% off code, and that is a great price
