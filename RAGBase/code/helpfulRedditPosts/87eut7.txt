LPT: millennials, when you’re explaining how broke you are to your parents/grandparents, use an inflation calculator. Ask them what year they started working, and then tell them what you make in dollars from back then. It will help them put your situation in perspective.

Edit: whoo, front page! 

Lots of people seem offended at, “explain how broke you are.” That was meant to be a little tongue in cheek, guys. The LPT is for talking about money if someone says, “yeah well I only made $10/hour in the 60s,” or something similar.   it’s just an idea about how to get everyone on the same page.

Edit2: there’s lots of reasons to discuss money with family. It’s not always to beg for money, or to  get into a fight about who had it worse. I have candid conversation about money with my family, and I respect their wisdom and advice.
