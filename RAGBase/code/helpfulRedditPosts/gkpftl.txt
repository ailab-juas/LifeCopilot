LPT: If you don't match 100% of the qualifications, apply anyway!

People who fit 100% of the qualifications are most likely applying for higher jobs. Companies will hire you if they believe you can learn fast and adapt to their company culture. 

Apply anyway! Get in contact with the recruiter! You've got it. I believe in you
