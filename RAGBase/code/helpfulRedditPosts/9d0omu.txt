LPT: If an online advertisement asks you to answer demographic questions, just say you are less than 13 years old and they won't show you any ads.

Tested this multiple times while using an online citation machine that forces you to watch an ad video every 48 hours. When the pre-ad survey pops up to "improve my advertisement experience" I just select the youngest age and the whole pop-up closes.
