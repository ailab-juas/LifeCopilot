title:
YSK there exists a Star Wars prequel trilogy (ep 1-3) recut by fans to remove most annoyances

content:
Episode 1 - Shadow of the Sith

Faster pace, barely any Jar-Jar interaction, no toilet humour, Anakin saves the day, and no midichlorians whatsoever. https://ifdb.fanedit.org/sots/

Episode 2 - The Republic Divided

Strongly reduced awkward romance between Anakin and Padme (only the better scenes are left in), clearer plot, R2D2 never fliies, and Yoda doesn't jump around like the Energizer bunny.

Episode 3 - Dawn of the Empire

https://ifdb.fanedit.org/dote/

Anakin is shown in darker personality, he kills Dooku without being goaded by Palpatine, his reason for learning the dark side feels clearer, and more importantly, the twins are never named, and Vador doesn't yell "Nooooooooo" when he gets his armor for the first time.

Please keep in mind these are fanedits and as such you must own a copy of the movies first.
