LPT: If you lose your gas cap, Go to a gas station and tell them you lost it and ask if anyone turned one in. Gas stations often have 2 or 3 found ones.

The kid at my local gas station showed me a box of "lost and found" gas caps once, there was like 10 of them. Then, I actually lost my own gas cap. The next time I stopped for gas(it wasn't the same place), I told the lady I lost it. She said she only had one there, and it was there a year or so and I could have it if it fit.
