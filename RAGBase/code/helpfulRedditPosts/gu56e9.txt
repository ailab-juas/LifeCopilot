title:
LPT: if you start crying while having an emotional argument or discussion, just keep talking

content:
Crying is not a sign of weakness, it shows that you care a lot about whatever you’re talking about. However, it’s also often distracting to all the parties involved. 

If you stop talking, it draws even more attention to you crying, and the other party may stop your discussion to ask if you’re alright or if you need to stop. If you keep talking and draw as little attention to it as possible, it keeps the conversation going and draws the attention away from you and back to the discussion. Wipe away your tears as you need, and ignore any voice cracks as well. 

Eventually no one will pay attention to you crying and your voice will steady out. You may even stop crying without noticing. Not stopping keeps the conversation moving and draws the attention from you and back to the the discussion.
