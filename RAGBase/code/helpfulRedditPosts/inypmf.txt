YSK using a dishwasher will help you save time, money, and the environment.

content:
Why YSK: Dishwashers manufactured after 2013 only use up to 5 gallons of water per load and can save you up to 5000 gallons of water a year. 

Additionally, it will save you electricity as it takes a lot more energy to heat all the extra water you need to use with your hand washing. 

With the newer models, no need to rinse every dish before sticking it in the washer either - the newer washers should be able to handle the extra food debris (to an extent...).
