LPT: if you're taking care of children, always make bed time special and safe, always

content:
Doesn't matter what happened that day or who you/they are, treat bed time like a separate universe where nothing even remotely bad or negative exists or happened, especially if you're not the best with kids. Dump everything you have into bed time, stories, I love yous, tuck ins, everything and don't let any negativity from you, them, videogames, or anything slip in. Bed time is unique as it's their reset button for the next day and is huge in their development as it's the precursor for sleep which is vital emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually, everything. It's their only true alone time even if they don't remember the dreams. If you can only be nice at one point in the day for some reason, make it bed time.
