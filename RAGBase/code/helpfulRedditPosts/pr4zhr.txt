LPT Cauliflower crust is not necessarily Vegan, and pizza workers probably won't even know to tell you.

content:
A couple came into my work (pizza place) asking for an alternative crust. When they asked for no cheese topping, the boss confirmed with them that they know the crust would have cheese as a binder, as all pizza places in the whole area do.

They immediately declined the pizza, and left the store, their concept of pizza shattered.

Needless to say, do thorough research if you're on any sort of diet, and try not to assume anything about the food you eat.

Edit: To clarify, the couple first asked for the alternative crust (which had cheese in it), and then specified they did not want cheese as a topping, because of their diet. This leads me to believe they had several dietary restrictions.
