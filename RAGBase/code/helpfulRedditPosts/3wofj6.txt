LPT: If you know someone who considers themselves an aficiando of something, do not attempt to gift them that something.

As an example, my sister gifted my SO and I a wine membership last year for Christmas (one of the many you see advertised online during the holidays).  The wine we got delivered was terrible. They delivered in the summer  (reputable wine clubs usually have a freeze period on deliveries during hot months to ensure your wine isn't ruined during shipment) and didn't mark that there needed to be a 21 or older signature upon delivery.

If someone is a fan or experienced with some type of product, they will know more about it than you. Don't give a professional chef a knife. Whatever he/she has on their kitchen is probably much nicer and more expensive  than anything a layperson of that field would buy. If you know someone who frequents wine tastings and has a collection of wine, they probably have at least one (if not several) wine membeships. The gesture to get someone something they would love is wonderful, but the actual gifts fall short. 

If choosing to go this route this way, ask the gift receiver or someone close to them their preferences or do some snooping to see what they already have. There are experts out there to help find something comparable! 

EDIT: Spelling.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold! See me later on TIFU by telling all of reddit my sister's gift last year sucked. 
Honestly, my sister is very thoughtful and I am very hard to buy for. She had the best of intentions and I did appreciate the sentiment. I think she went with the same company where she ordered some other "of the month" memberships.
