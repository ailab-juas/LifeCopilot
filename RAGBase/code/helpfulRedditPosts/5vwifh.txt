LPT: If your dishwasher is leaving a film on your glasses and dishes, fill a bowl of white vinegar and put the bowl in the dishwasher, with no other dishes, and run a full cycle with just the bowl of vinegar in it. Then dump a cup of baking soda in it and run another cycle.

I did this and the film didnt come back on future washes.
