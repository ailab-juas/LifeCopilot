LPT: When writing a thesis or a scientific paper, don't end your day with a completed section. Write at least one or two sentences into the next topic to make it easier for your future self to continue writing the next day.

As a lazy person, I have big trouble starting to write. When I am in, it helps me a lot to think through my next logical steps and write a few sentences into that direction so I can continue seamlessly the next day..

Also sorry if that was bad english (I am not studying english :D)
