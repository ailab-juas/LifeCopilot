LPT: Keep a note on your phone and add gift ideas to it when friends and family casually mention their interests. It makes gift buying during Christmas and birthdays a hell of a lot easier.

I started keeping a file on OneNote about seven months ago. Itâ€™s made gift buying easier and a lot more fun. 

Edits: 1) Sorry I decided to share this two weeks before Christmas. I just now discovered how useful this can be. I'm sure you know someone with a birthday coming up though... 2) Amazon lists are great too, but can't capture ideas like trips to the beach or a restaurant. 3) Yes, this should be common sense, but I doubt the majority of people ACTUALLY do this as a matter of habit. It's common sense to control your diet and exercise, but how many people [actually do it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States)? I was hoping this would be a practical tip to help make it happen.
