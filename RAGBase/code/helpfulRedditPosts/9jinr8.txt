title:
YSK that it takes longer to read capital letters

content:
When typing a sentence in all caps, remember that people read capital letters slower than lowercase. If it's a particularly long sentence, then it will be even worse. Single words and a phrase like "WHAT THE FUCK" are fine, it's when someone constructs a sentence using them then they've done a disservice to everyone reading it.

Also, I found the source after making this post because I found this out during an episode of Top Gear when James May was speaking to a lady who designs the road signs in the UK and this is one of the things she said.
