LPT: If you work at a place that takes time sensitive orders, ask customers "When is too late?" instead of "When do you need it done?". This keeps them from saying "As soon as possible" and gives you a real time frame.

I work at a print shop. When people place an order I've started asking this. Everyone wants their stuff as soon as possible. That goes with out saying. If you ask when is too late They'll usually just give you a date right away.

EDIT: Thank you all for all the responce and reddit points!
I've gotten a lot of great suggestions on improving the exact language which is really helpful!
I know this isn't a universal things and when dealing with customers you have to read the situation on an individual bases. The main idea of saying something like this is to get the customer to think about when they need it and give you a real time frame.
