YSK about Pexels, a website that provides free stock images licensed under Creative Commons. They can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

content:
Services like Shutterstock and Adobe Stock charge you money to use their images.

 On Pexels, you don't need to buy a license or even credit the photographer (but it's appreciated!).

Visit them at www.pexels.com

Edit: there's a mistake in the title. As u/prikaz_da points out,  the images aren't licensed under creative commons but under Pexels' own simple license that doesn't require attribution.

Second edit: I've complied a list of great websites similar to Pexels shared by commenters
