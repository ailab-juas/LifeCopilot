YSK that screaming at people in your family is not normal in a lot of households, and a starting point for abuse

content:
Edit: If you want a book recommendation I recommend “How to Deal with Emotionally Explosive People” by Albert Bernstein. I read this as a 19 year old trying to understand why my dad exploded at us so much and it made me realize I was also headed down that path of exploding at people. I read a bunch of books to help me but this one really sticks out.

Why YSK: Many people who grow up with a parent who screams at them when angry ends up doing it to friends or members of their own family when they grow up. They don't know that, for a lot of people who grew up with healthier family dynamics, it's not normal to be screamed at and can feel very scary. Screaming at someone angrily isn't necessarily abuse, but habitually screaming at someone to scare or upset them or to 'get your way', especially when also insulting them or cursing at them, is considered abusive. You'd be surprised how many people do not know this and think screaming is normal!
