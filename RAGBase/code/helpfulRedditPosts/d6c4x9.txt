LPT If someone is acting like they don’t care about you, believe them.

Edit: I thought that my point was obvious, my mistake.   

If there is anyone in your life, at any capacity, who straight up acts as they don’t care about you, you should take their actions at face value.   

For example, if you a friend who always is being a dick but you rationalize it by saying “uhh yeah- it’s just an act, deep down they are nice”, then stop. You should assume that they mean they way the act, and not seek deeper meaning.
