LPT - If you have a great boss or owner at your workplace then don’t treat them like every other boss

content:
I don’t know if this has been said before but throughout my life I have seen employees with wonderful bosses or company owners but the worker treats them like every other boss or company.  (Ex. Bare minimum, bad attitude, tardiness)

You may not think it matters but when they move on from you and you get to experience a bad work environment with terrible bosses you will wish you hadn’t taken advantage of your old one.  

And if they don’t move on from you, there’s a likelihood your boss will become jaded or disconnected and slowly transition into becoming a shit boss since it didn’t seem to matter much
