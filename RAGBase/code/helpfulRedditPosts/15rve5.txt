LPT: This is a bit late, but for your new years resolution, dont just set goals that are abstract and vague, set something quantifiable! (examples in description)

content:
* I'm going to lose weight -&gt; I'll run 1 mile every day
* I'm going to be more social -&gt; I'm going to meet 5 new people each day
* I'm going to spend more time with family -&gt; Family night every friday!
* Quit Smoking -&gt; I will smoke at least one less cigarette each week

These are just some examples, but I hope this helps make this year ∞ times better than the past!

One other thing I thought of was telling your resolution to someone else that will be excited for you! This will be great and helpful because when you are plannin on taking that extra slice of cake, you'll remember that so-and-so will be askin you about it later, and you might re-think your decision. And when you tell so-and-so that you did re-think your decision, they are goin to be happy for you which will only lead to better decisions later on! :)

**Edit 1: Formatting**

**Edit 3: Wow guys! 100+ comments! Wishin all of you a happy new years, one filled with complete resolutions and karma. Thanks for makin mine awesome! If i see any more helpful subreddits, i'll add them to the list!**

**Edit 4: Damn its still goin, wow, most comments ever on a post! Also its great readin through many of your posts and your goals for the year! I genuinely hope that you are able to attain you goals and maybe a few steps beyond! Its great to know that some of you felt that I helped you all. Added some more subreddits thanks to posts and discovery :)**

**Edit 5: this thread has been more active than I expected... Added some formatting changes, and another rambling thought that I hope will help. Any ways, after I wake up tmrw, I'll look for more subreddits that seem interestin / useful! And to all of of you that are sayin thanks, its greatly welcomed! Knowin I helped so many people is already making me feel like this year has been ∞ times better than 2012, but keep in mind, that this was only half the battle! The other half starts with you! :)**

**Edit 6: added more subreddits**
