LPT: If you think you have ADHD and can afford full panel testing with a neuropsychologist, get tested

content:
My ass has apparently been depressed since the age of 7, and my high verbal and reasoning skills tricked every therapist I've interacted with for 20 years into thinking it was just ADHD behavioral issues. I also apparently do something called intellectualization where I think I've reasoned out my feelings, but my feelings are still there lying in wait for a new trigger. Everybody missed this because I can analytically approach how I feel and my therapists consistently were like \*enlightened queen\*. Normal people actually feel their emotions and I've got a therapist lined up with new vocabulary to describe my issues so I can hopefully understand how to reconnect with my emotions and actually process them properly.
