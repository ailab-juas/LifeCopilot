YSK: Nearly 1.7 million jack stands sold by Harbor Freight have been recalled due to risk of collapse. If you have any 6-ton or 3-ton models with the model numbers: 61196, 61197, or 56371 do not use them!

My earlier post was taken down for being about social media. This time I didn't include the link. You can get a refund if you return the jack stands to Harbor Freight. Stay safe.
