LPT: Sign up for a service contract you no longer want to be in? Request to see a copy of the agreement you signed. If they're unable to produce it, you're out and possibly entitled to a refund!

Long story short, gf bought a laptop 2 years ago and was upsold on the 3 year service plan. She's been paying $30/month for said service plan, which she barely knew she had let alone ever used. This amounts to $1100 over three years! Seeing as she never used it, I phoned the company to cancel but they told me she was under contract for 3 years and it was not cancellable unless paid in full. So I requested to see a copy of her signature on an agreement, and they spent a week searching for it. They couldn't find it, so not only are they cancelling it, but they're mailing us a cheque for $700 (the amount paid to date) as by their records we never agreed to it in the first place.

TL;DR Company was so set on playing by the book, so I used it against them to get out of a service contract and get a refund of monies paid to date.
