title:
YSK to leave ample room in front of large trucks on the road

content:
Why YSK: This seems pretty obvious but the amount of people that I see not doing this every day blows my mind. Large work trucks/semis need more room than you think to slow down and stop, so merging right in front of them can be extremely dangerous. If the truck cant stop in time or the brakes arenâ€™t working for some reason you could have 80,000lbs slammed into the back of your car. Not to mention the blind spots in front of the trucks.
