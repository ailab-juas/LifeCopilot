YSK that links to news articles about missing children are usually out of date and should not automatically be shared.

It may only take 2 seconds to share but it takes ten seconds to open the article read the top few lines then share if they are still missing. 

By sharing an article about a missing child or person that has been found, we are diluting genuine cases.
