YSK: There are two types of “Sudafed” and if you have a cold or flu and need a reliable nasal decongestant go to the pharmacist directly and ask for Sudafed. Don’t get Sudafed(PE) which is in the aisle along with the other regular decongestants.

Why YSK: Sudafed(PE) contains phenylephrine which is the active ingredient in almost every other similar OTC medication. This is a very weak type of decongestant and may not even provide you substantial relief. The Sudafed that is kept with the pharmacist contains pseudoephedrine (hence the name) and is the real one. It is much stronger at alleviating your nasal congestion. I feel like not many people realize this and settle for less effective OTC meds.
