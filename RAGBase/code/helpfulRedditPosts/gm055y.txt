I see this on posts frequently. Weary means exhausted. Leery and wary are synonyms meaning suspicious, cautious, alert to danger. 

Thank you and happy Redditing!

Edit: Thank you for the awards, karma, and comments! I am incredibly touched. This post is from a friendly language nerd and intended in a gentle, helpful spirit. I love that it inspired puns, poetry, Always Sunny references, and linguistic discussion. 

Thank you all!
