LPT: When your kid asks you an awkward question, use the "icecream question" system.

content:
So I was taking inventory of Reddit comments and I found this gem that I saved. I was in the process of deleting and bookmarking cause my Gold is running out, so I can't filter (and I shouldn't be using a feature that might run out on awkward times) blah blah. 

And then I noticed in [the original AskReddit thread seven months back, the OP deleted it, which I thought was a shame.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3go0pw/people_with_kids_whats_the_most_embarrassing/cu04dg3) And since I'm not going to delete my comment, maybe this time it will stick in my archives for now. 

**Anyhooooo....**

Useful for dealing with kids who ask you awkward questions that are best answered later. 

**Here's the text:** 

&gt; 
&gt; I did shit like this all the time **so my dad came up with "ice cream questions".** Whenever I asked a question that was hard to answer or if I demanded an answer to an awkward question in public he'd say
&gt; 
&gt; "That's an ice cream question"
&gt; 
&gt; And the rule with ice cream questions was that
&gt; 
&gt; 1) it meant I asked a really good question
&gt; 
&gt; 2) I couldn't ask the question again or I wouldn't get ice cream
&gt; 
&gt; 3) he would explain it that day over ice cream
&gt; 
&gt; Which worked amazing because he shut down awkward questions immediately and explained them on his terms, but bad because I had so much ice cream.
&gt; 
&gt; Edit; so usually I never edit questions for blowing up, but it's so cool that my dad gets recognized for his badass parenting! He's a pretty incredible dude.
&gt; 
&gt; My dad read the book "[emotional intelligence](http://amzn.com/055338371X)" when I was first born, and read about the marshmallow test along with a bunch of other things he's based his parenting around. The marshmallow test was about seeing if children could be taught patience or if a need for instant gratification was inherent, and if it was an indicator for long term success. He then proceeded to work this into ice cream questions, to teach me to ask questions but know when to stop and how to wait for better things.
&gt; 
&gt; He is now insisting I "tell the Internet" to read the book.
