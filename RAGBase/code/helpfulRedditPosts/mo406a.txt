YSK: Cutting/Trimming your dogs nails regularly is one of the easiest and most important things you can do for your dog. Failing to do so will likely result in behaviour- and posture-issues.

Why YSK: 90% of all dogs that have their pictures posted on Reddit have nails that are overgrown or too long. Too long nails are a serious medical problem and should not be taken lightly.

Not only do they cause discomfort and pain and can cause lameness or injury but can also lead to posture and spine problems in the long run. Good trimmed nails do not touch the ground and do not "click" while the dog is walking. 

It is important to trim the nails regularly because only then will the blood vessels retreat further into the claw and the nails can then be shortened to a good length. So if your dog has very long nails do not cut them at once or you will hurt him/her.

For people who are unsure or have a dog with black nails as I do I can recommend the following very detailed article which also includes illustrations.

I personally use an electric nail grinder because the risk of injury is much lower and my dog has black nails. It takes around 2 weeks to make your dog familiar with the machine and before you can actually start using it but it was definitely worth it in the long run. Nowadays cutting nails takes maybe 10 minutes and is no hustle at all.


(optional) edit:  
many people rightfully so keep pointing out to me that with many dogs cutting nails is everything but easy. What I actually meant by “easy” in the title was that it is something you can do at home without spending a lot of money and that is very good for your dog.

There are already many very helpful comments in this post like this one by [u/succmynugz](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/mo406a/ysk_cuttingtrimming_your_dogs_nails_regularly_is/gu2oone?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

To those why struggle and are asking for advice I would suggest to familiarize your dog with the process very slowly. Try make it a fun dare game. It will only take two 3 minutes sessions a day and you should see progress in no time and reap rewards forever.

Feel free to start the progress at the stage where your dog is at. 
First make sure your dog is comfortable with being touched at the feet. Start by moving your hand slowly and hovering above his feet. Have fun together and use lots of praise and little kibbles for motivation. Maybe next day you can touch the feet for 1 second, then 3 seconds and so on. Next week you maybe can grab the feet shortly, maybe after that you can lift them. Try sticking a finger between the toes after that. Repeat the process with the scissors or whatever tool you use. Show them, then touch the feet with them. Move them next to the feet and before you know it you cut the first nail and the dog is not really phased by it. I don’t recommend cutting more then a few nails at once in the beginning and keep on paying for success between every nail in the beginning. If the dog panics at any stage go back one or more steps.

The worse the fear the longer the process will take but you will eventually get there.
I did try to keep it short and English is not my first language but I hope I could get the point across.
My heart goes out to all of you who are struggling and trying. I truly know where you come from!
