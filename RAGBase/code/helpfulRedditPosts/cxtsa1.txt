YSK that a layover of less than an hour and a half is not sufficient for a international flight passing through the USA

content:
Transiting through the USA, even in your origin and/or destination is not in the United States, will require you to pickup and re-check your luggage and go through TSA.

I bought a Montreal - Singapore flight from United that had a 1h20 stop in SF. While I was (barely) able to catch the plane, my luggage didn't.

Bonus YSK for Canadians, if your luggage are delayed, a new law states that you may be entitled to compensation for the expenses caused by the delay.
