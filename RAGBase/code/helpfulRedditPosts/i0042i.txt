YSK that in the U.S. posession by consumption (having illegal drugs in your system) is NOT a crime, with the exception of minors and alcohol.

content:
If you or a friend is in danger because of something you took, don't hesitate to get help out of fear of legal repercussions. Just call for help, and dispose of any unconsumed substances while waiting. Never hesitate to tell a doctor or paramedic what you or someone else took. They don't care if it's illegal or not, and after it's been consumed, neither do the cops. You cannot be charged for drugs already in your system.

Even for alcohol and minors, which is the only exception, the punishment is not worth hesitating to get help if you need it. For first time offenders it's typically just a fine, and while it seems terrible at the time, you will get over it and it will blow over. Avoiding it is not worth risking a life.

Edit: As many comments have pointed out, it's always a good idea to check your state laws before doing anything potentially illegal! Also, apparently you should never do drugs in South Dakota, because they're real sticklers over there. There are a few states where you could get in trouble, but again, that trouble is not worth dying over. It's probably going to be a fine, much like minor in possession.
