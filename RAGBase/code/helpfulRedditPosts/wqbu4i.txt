LPT: Video interview your parents when they start getting older about their life as a kid, growing up, meeting their SO, etc. so you have something better than pictures to remember them by.

All I needed to get started was:

* A smartphone to record video
* A [cheap tripod](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NWC3L95) that can hold a phone
* [Clip on microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AG56HYQ) for better audio

Set up someplace quiet and ask them leading questions:

* What was your first memory?
* What was life like as a child?
* Where did you go to elementary school?  Who were your friends?
* Did your family go on vacation?  Where?
* What was aunt/uncle like when they were younger?
* What did you do after school?
* What big events do you remember as a kid?

You can later edit out all the questions you ask so it flows better and your parents are just talking about their life.

I found out a ton of things about my mom's life when she was younger that I had no clue about and I've very glad I got it on video while she's still in good health.  

I'm planning on interviewing my mom annually and asking her about different times of her life.  Someday when she's gone we'll have a video of her talking about her life that we can show friends and family.
