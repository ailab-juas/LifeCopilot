LPT: The best way to support someone suffering from depression is doing paperwork and organizing appointments for them

content:
If a loved one is suffering from depression and you don't know how to support them, let me tell you that listening to them and being there for them is good, but ultimately they'll need professional help. 

What you can do for them however is searching for therapists, making phone calls for appointments, helping them do necessary paperwork etc. These things are very hard and exhausting to do when you're depressed, which is the biggest obstacle to looking for professional help.

Organizing things for someone with depression is NOT a sign of weakness on their end. You wouldn't expect someone with a broken leg to walk to ER all by themselves or someone drowning to just swim to the coast themselves. They are literally incapable of doing these things and if you help them crossing that hurdle, their chances of getting better dramatically increase.
 
(Of course, once they do get better and are in a better spot they'll have to learn to do it by themselves, but helping them in that early stage when they're too depressed to do anything is crucial.)
