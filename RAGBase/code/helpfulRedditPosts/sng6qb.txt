YSK if you're in the UK, pay for your prescriptions AND get at least two prescriptions per month, you'll be better off getting a pre-paid certificate

Why YSK:

The cost for a prescription in the UK is currently £9.35 per item. If you get prescribed medication regularly you will likely save so much money annually by purchasing a pre-payment certificate. It costs £108.10 for 12 months which can be paid in one go or in 10 monthly direct debit installments.

EDIT: this info is for England only as I have since learnt that Scotland and Wales offer free prescriptions anyway
