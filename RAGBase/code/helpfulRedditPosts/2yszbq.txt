YSK that if you sign up for Spotify Premium, don't do it on your mobile app! $12.99/month vs. $9.99/month on their website.

content:
Save yourself $3/month from now until... whenever. I was kind of shocked to see such a price difference for literally the exact same service.

**Edit**: A couple people have pointed out that there is no price difference between the mobile and web version of Spotify on Android. So, as pointed out by /u/yokuyuki, this appears to affect only iPhone users ~~(maybe Windows phone users? Do they even have a Spotify app?)~~ because Apple takes a 30% cut of a developer's sale.  

**Edit 2**: Christ okay I get it. WP users have Spotify. RIP my inbox.
