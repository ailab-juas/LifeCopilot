LPT: Make a QR code that will automatically connect your house guests to the WiFi when scanned. Then print it out and put wherever works.

I like to use this [website](https://qifi.org/), but there are a number of others that work as well. Copy and paste it into a doc and print it out.

No more telling your guests super long passwords and telling them when it’s upper or lower case. Just show them the code and scan away.

It seems silly not too what with iOS 11 now being able to scan QR codes natively right from the camera app. Android will still have to get a third party app though. And even if they can’t scan it the password will still work.

Hope this makes you’re life a little bit easier! Whether you’re the guest or the host.
