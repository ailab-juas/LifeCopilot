LPT:Don't just assume your child is quiet or mature

content:

TLDR: Depression can be easily mistaken as growing up/ maturing, reach out to kids/friends after a sudden change in personality 

If you have kids, pay attention. 


If in the past you have had an emotional child, (crying, sass, anger, etc.) and they slowly become a more reserved child (rarely showing emotion, very even temper, etc) check up on them. 


One of the most overlooked symptoms and misconceptions about depression is that it isn’t just being sad and crying. It can simply be feeling nothing. 
While it may seem like your child is maturing and “growing up”, it may be depression setting in. 


Speaking from personal experience, I was always praised as being “level headed and mature” for my age. I would go to family events, and when someone would notice I didn’t get into debates or upset when someone teased me, my mom would always say “oh he’s ___ going on 30” or “He’s just so level headed”


I don’t mean that your child should be constantly crying, acting out, and getting angry, but almost never showing any kind of emotion isn’t good. Let your child know that you can talk to them about anything, promise to not have any consequences about whatever they tell you. 


This can go for your friends of any age as well, but is directed towards parents since they are the most likely to assume their kids are just growing up.
