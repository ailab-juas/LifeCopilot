LPT: When feeling down; clean.

content:
When feeling unaccomplished, bored or even a little depressed - start cleaning or organising something. Be it your place, car or notes. After you've finished you'll feel as if you've achieved something (especially if it was a huge mess in the first place.) It'll distract you if not, make you forget what it was that made you feel down etc. in the first place. So grab the hoover and your headphones, crank up the tunes and go for it!
