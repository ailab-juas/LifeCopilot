LPT If you’re trying to cut back on drinking, try making an apple cider vinegar soda as a substitute. The fermentation of the vinegar as well as the carbonation of the soda should satisfy your craving!

I make mine with:
- lime sparkling water
- a tablespoon or 2 of ACV 
- a splash of plain aloe juice concentrate (which surprisingly makes it taste more alcoholic to me)

I’m a heavy alcohol consumer and when the ACV hits my system, seems to trick my body a bit, causing a relaxing affect. 

Try it! Highly recommend!!
