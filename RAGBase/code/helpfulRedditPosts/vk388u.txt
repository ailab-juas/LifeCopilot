YSK: Planned Parenthood provides vasectomies at low cost or no cost.

content:
Why YSK: Many people would like a vasectomy but are concerned about the cost or what type of doctor to see. Many are surprised to learn this type of procedure is offered there.

Planned Parenthood offers a sliding scale cost, starting at zero if you cannot pay. Your visit to them is confidential. If it’s a procedure you’re sure you want, check them out.

Edit to clarify: I am speaking of U.S. locations, due to fears that birth control pills and IUDs could be banned for women soon.

I will *not* get involved in a debate on yesterday’s ruling, this post is about *preventing* pregnancy. There are many other posts for debate, in other subs.

It appears most, but not all, of Planned Parenthood locations in the U.S. offer this.

If you have health insurance an alternative is to ask if they cover an in network urologist locally to conduct the procedure, but you may have copays and coinsurance. Failing that, I’d suggest the local and/or state health department, or local non profit health clinic, for advice or referrals to other services or low cost options they may or may not be aware of.

Please note that vasectomy is PERMANENT. While you may see advertisements for vasectomy reversal, it is expensive and the chances of it being successful are low.

There are companies you can hire to deep freeze and store a sample you provide prior to surgery. This way there is an emergency backup should you want IVF for a partner in the future, however it should not be relied upon, as both freezers and companies can fail.
