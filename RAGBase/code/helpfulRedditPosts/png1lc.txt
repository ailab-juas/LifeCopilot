LPT: Instead of trying to kill a fly by hitting it, spray it with water

content:
During the summer my house gets filled up with flies because my kids are always running in and out of the house. So I carry a spray bottle around with me. The minute I see a fly in my peripheral vision or if it lands on something I spray it. The fly can’t see the water coming the way it would see my hand or a flyswatter coming. Once it gets wet it’s wings don’t work anymore and eventually it will fall. That’s when you squish it. Works every time.
