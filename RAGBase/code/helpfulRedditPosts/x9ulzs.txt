title:
LPT: A minimum-effort workout is miles better in the long-run than no workout

content:
It took me many years of my life to make this realization. Over time I noticed there would be periods where I started working out, became a gym rat going nearly every day, then along the way somehow I stopped going and a year or two would pass before I started again and repeated the cycle. I finally realized that it was because I would commit 100% in the beginning, and of course two months later I was not able to keep the momentum going. But when I felt lazy, rather than just go to the gym for less time that day, I would stay home. After too many skipped days, I felt like I had lost all my progress and that created even less motivation to keep showing up. Finally, nearly in my 30s I have for the first time been able to create a consistent schedule that has been maintained for over a year, and this is only because I have agreed to myself to keep going no matter how "low-effort" the workout will look like or how I feel. Had I done this from the beginning, my health would already be so much better today than what it is.
