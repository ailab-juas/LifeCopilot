LPT - if you're comforting a mourning friend or family member, clean the shit out of their house.

content:
It gives you something to do (rather than just sit there and wallow in the misery) and it's a tangible good that will provide them comfort. 

EDIT - for clarity, when I say "clean the shit out of" I mean "clean it so well they remark with an expletive of some kind when they see it'
