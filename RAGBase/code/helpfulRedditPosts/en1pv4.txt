title:
LPT: Always carey emergency mylar blankets. They may seem extremely thin but they reflect over 90% of body heat. They can save you in very cold situations or save someone in shock.

content:
They look like aluminum foil and usually come in a bag. Keep a few in your car to save a life. *carry is spelled wrong in the title -not always carry one just in your car or something ~it doesnâ€™t always help people in shock, just keeps them warm
