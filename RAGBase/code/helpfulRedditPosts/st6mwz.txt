LPT - If you get a call from a utility/bank/etc. saying there is a problem with your account, hang up immediately and call their main Customer Service number.

It's very easy to protect yourself from someone claiming to be with your bank, your cell phone provider, your power company, etc.  Whenever you get a call from someone claiming that there is a problem with your account and they want you provide account-verification information, then DON'T DO IT.  Just hang up, then call them on their official customer service line.  This will ensure you get in touch with a real employee and you can ask them if there is, really, a problem with your account.  

It's really easy for some scammer to call you and say they are a Verizon employee, but it's very hard for a scammer to get your callback from within the actual Verizon call center....
