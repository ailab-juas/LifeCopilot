YSK: Your TV might have a volume leveling option in the settings, making it so much easier to watch movies with intense changes in volume.

This may be obvious, but I rarely go to the settings on my TV so I just noticed it this week. It has been a game changer. 

Why YSK: It eliminates the need to babysit the volume on poorly mixed movies, which can be stressful and really take you out of whatever you're watching.
