YSK that income tax brackets are applied on the margin. Earning enough to reach a higher tax bracket doesn't mean you're losing money compared to being at the top of the previous lower tax bracket.

It stumps me that I keep meeting people who earn 6 and 7 figures who don't understand this. I see people earning millions who are genuinely convinced that *all* of their income is being taxed at the rate of the highest bracket, and that it's unfair that Joe Shmoe earning $25k is being taxed less.

Follow this link:

Your first $9k is always taxed at 10%, even if you earn enough to put you in the highest tax bracket. You do not lose money by crossing a tax bracket threshold.

The Wikipedia link is for the US, but income tax is applied this way in nearly every country I know.
