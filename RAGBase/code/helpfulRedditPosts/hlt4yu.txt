title:
YSK that if you're driving a boat, you should try to stay far from boats that are stationary

content:
Especially at high speeds, your boat can create big waves that rock boats that are still. This can really irritate boat-owners and is also dangerous.

Please be courteous to others. You've got the whole lake/ocean/body of water to drive your boat. Use it.
