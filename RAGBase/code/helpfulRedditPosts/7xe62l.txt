LPT: When someone is excited about something that isn't a good idea, don't burst their bubble right away. They won't be open to hearing the negative. Wait til they're in a more logical state and then ask the questions that will make them realize why it's not a good idea.

 Edit: I'm talking about the INITIAL excitement, people.  When they're telling you the idea is the peak so just let that die down a bit first before pointing out the possible obstacles.  And whether the idea is good or bad doesn't matter......it's for the people who THINK the person's idea is bad and want to poke holes in it.
