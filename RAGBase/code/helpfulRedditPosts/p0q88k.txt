LPT: You are free to be sad, just because someone might have it worse elsewhere, does not invalidate your own feelings

content:
 People will sometimes say something like: Well, just be lucky you're not homeless, or that you're not in a third world country or not a single parent, or with an abused partner or this and that, trying to invalidate other people's feelings. That is wrong.

Yes, there are people who have it worse. But that shouldn't need to be said, whenever you feel sad, angry or any negative feelings. You are allowed to feel negative. That is a way to grieve, to start healing.

Pushing your feelings back, is not good. That just makes you yell at others, or become quiet, not willing to share anything.

Note: Not saying it's good to overreact, because it's not. Just saying that your own feelings are important as well, no one should tell you it's nothing to cry over, or nothing to feel negative over.
