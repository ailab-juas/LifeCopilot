LPT: Don’t pay for Kindle books, Library’s allow you to download to a Kindle device for free

content:
I know, I know…. Libraries are free. That part is not the pro tip. Those that got a Kindle or other e-reader for the holidays will be tempted to purchase ‘new’ books for their device. Rather than spending your money, go to your local library’s website and register for a library card. From their you can check out e-reader books for free and have them immediately downloaded on your device.
