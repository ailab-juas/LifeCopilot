LPT: Perfect is the enemy of great. Don’t let your fear of doing something badly, or averagely stop you from doing or starting it. Just get started and improve on what you have, it’s much easier and faster than trying to make your first attempt perfect.

Title says it all really. I think this is true of most things (obviously not brain surgery or something like that) but I’ve seen this in business a lot. I’ve worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs and often they fear launching a site or a product or an idea because they’re worried that it won’t be perfect from the start and so they’ll fail. 

The truth is it won’t ever be perfect and you could still fail anyway.

Does Bezos think Amazon is perfect? No. Musk think Tesla is perfect? No. They never will. Aim for perfect, sure. But don’t let it hold you back. Once you start, it’s easier to learn and improve upon what you have, than just to keep thinking about how to make it perfect from the start.

Just get started and see what happens. Doing anything well is a marathon, not a sprint. 2 bits of great advice that underpin this were from past CEOs I had (one who will likely have a unicorn business this year) are:

1) Get shit done.
2) Improve 1% or even just 0.00001% every day and over time you’ll see it.

So I’ll say it again… just get started! Launch that website you’ve been thinking of, start that painting, write that script, cook for your friend/partner. Whatever it is, you and it will get better over time, you just need to start!!
