YSK that retail employees really read customer comments submitted online by the link on your reciept. If you had a particularly good experience take some time out of your day to thank the employees that you interacted with.

Triple bonus points if you spot a nametag and mention the employee by name in your comment!  These people work low-paying, monotonous jobs, and if you can brighten their week by putting in a good word to the manager it does a lot.

I worked at Panera this past summer and our customer comments would be posted for a week at a time in the back room next to the coat rack.  We very infrequently got comments with employee names on them, but when we did we would get recognition from the managers, a special pin to put on our hats, and bragging rights with our name in bold for a whole week.

It may not seem like much, but it means a lot.  Really.
