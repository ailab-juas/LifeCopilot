title:
LPT - Don’t get under a car on a Jack.

content:
My boyfriend and I were at the gas station and I see a man parked off to the side with his car on a little Jack and he is under the car doing some work. I think to myself “that looks dangerous”. Two minutes later my boyfriend sprints over there and it takes me a minute to figure out what is happening. 

He is under the car and the Jack gave out. My boyfriend and one other guy are lifting the car but it’s not moving. My first reaction was to hide because I am pretty weak so I didn’t think I could be much help and I did not want to see a man die but then I realized any extra hands is better than less hands and I needed to help. So I ran over to help and we still were not able to lift the car enough. So I started yelling help loudly and eventually two more people came over. 

With all five of us we finally got the car lifted high enough for him to get out thank god. The lesson here is to not trust a jack! It’s for changing tires only!

Edit: When we got the car lifted he popped out and said he wasn't hurt.

Edit: Some people have left great comments on more advice.
1) The purpose of the Jack is to lift and lower the car not to hold it. Always use back up methods of solid support 
2) Don't work alone if you are getting under the car.
3) It's okay to call road side support.
