LPT: Wanna check if you're being followed? Cross the street twice.

content:
This is a tip that was drilled into my head as a kid, but a recent AITA thread made me realize that it might not be common knowledge-- 

How do you know if somebody is following you, or just walking in the same direction? Do you risk a confrontation if you're not sure? 

You can eliminate the uncertainty by crossing the street twice, or even 3 times. 

Crossing the street is a bit of a pain as a pedestrian. Most people don't do it unless they're sure they need to. Do it multiple times and you're walking in a way that's just *slightly* too weird for it to be coincidence if somebody crosses back and forth with you.


Other tactics include: 


- ~~go into the doorway of a building like you're going in, let them pass you~~ maybe don't do this becuase you risk getting trapped


- check over your shoulder with the reflection in your phone screen 


- go into and out of a store a couple of times

If you are being followed, walking in evasive patterns can give you time to confirm it, prepare yourself for confrontation, and get yourself to a safe or public area, without opening yourself up to as much risk.


Edit: other tips are coming up! We've also got: 

- stay in one place for 5 minutes, looking at your phone. If they go still when you do and start moving when you do, you're being followed 



- if they're not super close to you, take a couple of turns to interrupt their line of sight



- do a 180 and start walking in the exact opposite direction you were going 



- if you're in a car, circle the block a few times 



- all of this can be circumvented by a sufficiently skilled professional investigator. So uh, don't get professionally investigated.
