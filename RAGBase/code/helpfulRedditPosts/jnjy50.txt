YSK: A dog showing you his belly doesn't automatically mean he wants his belly rubbed. Check the tail! If it's tucked in and pointing towards their head, the dog is most likely scared rather than asking for affection.

Edit: As has been mentioned in the comments, my title may not be as clear as it should've been. These are signs, not absolutes, which is why I said "most likely" and "doesn't automatically" rather than stating this as a rule. The best way to understand how a dog is feeling is to use every piece of body language you can glean together, along with the context like whether the dog knows you and their temperament. If your friends dog who absolutely adores you and runs up to you tucks his tail when you're rubbing his belly, it's probably fine. If it's a dog you're meeting for the first time, or that was abused, you should probably back off a bit and let them come to you.

Why YSK: It's not uncommon at all for a scared dog to roll over and show their belly. It's an appeasement move, along the lines of "Maybe if I show I'm not a threat the scary thing will go away". People often misinterpret this as "pet my belly", which can be extra scary for an already scared dog!

If a dog is showing you his belly but his tail is clenched against the underside of his body, you probably shouldn't pet him! Tucking their tail in is an instinctual and protective move, and something you'll see when they feel unsafe.


Also, check for 'whale eyes' - this is when a dog sort of half-looks at you, in a way where you can see a lot of the whites of their eyes. It's very recognizable once you see it. It's often what people think is a 'guilty' look.


Finally, a tail wagging does not automatically mean happy! It just means mental stimulation.
