LPT: use hydrogen peroxide to remove blood stains from carpet.

content:
Just discovered this, my dog broke his toe nail and was bleeding all over the place. After taking care of him we had to clean up the blood. We dabbed each stain with a dry cloth to lift as much blood as we could. Then we went around and applied hydrogen peroxide to each stain, which dissolved the blood. After thay we used another dry cloth to dry up the hydrogen peroxide.

Just in case there is anyone in the same situation as myself, or any serial killers out there.
