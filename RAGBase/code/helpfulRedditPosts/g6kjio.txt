LPT: your employer is not your friend or colleague. Your employer is your client.

content:
A friendly reminder that your employer is not your colleague or friend. Your employer is your client. Their ultimate goal is to protect, maintain and grow as a company or as a brand. With or without you.  
As an employee, you will always be dispensable.  
   
Keep that in mind when things get sketchy at work.   

Also, if you live in the US, don't trust your employer regarding unemployment benefits, because unknown to many, unemployment comes from your employer. Employers pay unemployment insurance and for every employee that gets unemployment, their insurance rate goes up (similar to a car insurance). I've never met an employer that has not appealed an unemployment benefit just because they already have lawyer's for this, against an employee with no income...  
 But you got to know that with proof and documentation, you can win the appeal! (IANAL but I've successfully won claims for my husband just by stating the facts with proof in a standard legal way).
