LPT: Invest in a good shower head, especially if you rent...

content:
Landlords typically don’t care/ don’t bother replacing or even supplying decent shower heads. Invest in your own,    it will make a world of difference, and it doesn’t cost that much. Also, store the crappy shower head under the sink until you move so you can replace it and take yours with you. In my opinion, a good shower experience helps start the day off right. Make sure you’re enjoying your shower experience!
