YSK disposable razors last for months if you leave them resting in baby oil when not using them

Great advice from /u/itty53:

&gt;Since you're interested in razors, you should know a couple tips:

&gt;Steel razors are incredibly durable. 

&gt;And your stubble, no matter how manly, is not enough to chip or pit steel. When your razor wears out, it's *not* because of your use. 

&gt;It's because of how you treat the razor after you're done using it. Most people rinse it, maybe blow on it, then stick it back in the cabinet. This leaves little drops of water on the steel, causing it to rust and pit and wear out. 

&gt;So if you want your razors to last as long as possible, store them in a little cup of oil. Baby oil or mineral oil. The water can't sit there under oil, so it'll come right off. The oil itself won't hurt your blade. The blade will last an *astoundingly* long time. 

&gt;But it only takes once or twice of not doing that to wear the blade down. 

&gt;I've used a single disposable razor for over a year with this method. The only reason we still buy disposables is because my wife is too lazy to be bothered to do this. Her razors go bad after one use - she leaves them sitting in the shower. Same exact razors - all disposables from the same packaging. I'm convinced it would've lasted longer than a year too, the only reason it didn't is because my wife ran out of razors and she took the one I'd set aside. She left it in the shower again and it wore out immediately. 

&gt;Oil your blades.
