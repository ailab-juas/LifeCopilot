LPT: Give a stranger a compliment once daily. It is more likely to stick with them since you aren't a friend or family.

content:
I started thinking back to all the times I have been complimented and the little things stuck out to me. Random strangers saying things like *Hey, I like your sweater* as I walked by, and it stands out more than most of the times I have been complimented by friends/family. 

Doing this has made not only the other person feel good, but also myself, since you get to brighten someones day!

EDIT: Please keep sending your stories of complementing/being randomly complimented by strangers, I am really enjoying reading all of them!

EDIT 2: /u/Plsdontreadthis has informed me there is a subreddit, /r/candytostrangers, that is dedicated to this stuff!
