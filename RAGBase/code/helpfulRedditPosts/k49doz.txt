LPT: If you two paychecks away from homelessness, you should re-think getting a dog/cat.

content:
I don't know what it is with my friends who are _always_ broke making minimum wage living in the worst part of town because that's all they can afford, and they adopt the free dog/cat and then can't feed it or themselves. I get that poverty is hard, and having a special friend makes it easier, but anything that costs money when you are living paycheck to paycheck should be avoided at all costs. Imagine if you have one minor problem and can't pay your rent? Now you have this animal that is going to be put up for adoption, or worse, abandoned. I have seen it too many times that owners get tossed out and abandon their pets. It's heartbreaking. So, if you are two checks from being homeless, please do not get a pet.
