title:
YSK a six-word mantra that will give you perfect posture.

content:
1) Shoulders down

2) Shoulders back

3) Chin level

That's pretty much it.  Works for sitting, standing, and especially while walking.  Good posture is easy to achieve, but for me it's hard to *remember* to do it.  Keep this mantra in your head and repeat all day--your posture will improve immediately.
