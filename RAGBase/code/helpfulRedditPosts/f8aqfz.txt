YSK that you should never put your feet on the dashboard while a passenger in any vehicle.

I know that versions of this have been said before, but I feel it's worth repeating. I saw that xray of the person's femur protruding from their groin as a result of this again, and everytime I see it I feel like educating someone about this.

A friend of mine was killed when she was basically impaled on her own legs during an accident. The car wasn't even going that fast. The force of the deploying airbag *alone* is enough to irreparably damage your legs.

People are so used to driving around that they often forget how dangerous cars can be. It's one of the leading causes of death in the country. Even when all safety precautions are taken, death is never not a possible outcome of a collision.

I live in TX. Lots of people drive big trucks, and I can't tell you how often I'll see a pair of legs up on the passenger side dash.

Please please please stop doing this. 

It's not worth the danger. 

We need to spread awareness about this so that keeping your legs off the dash is as obvious as always wearing a seatbelt, or never driving while intoxicated.

Thank you for reading this. Tell your loved ones and don't ever let someone do this in your vehicle.

Edit: many have you have commented that it's a rude thing as well. While I certainly agree, I haven't seen this as something that's done by every passenger. More often than not it's a smaller female. My wife for instance once put her legs up like that on a long road trip. I thoroughly disabused her of it and she hasn't done it since.
