LPT: Pet guardians: your relationships with your pets will improve drastically if you remember that your pets are companions for you, not worshipers or ego inflators. Treat them with respect and a sense of humor, as you would a friend.

content:
Creating rigid expectations for your pets or taking bad behavior personally (“my feelings are hurt because my dog likes X more than me” or “my dog makes me look bad when he does Y”) often makes problems worse.  

If you want to develop a stronger relationship, build it through play, training, and kindness. Don’t do things that bother your pet for fun (like picking up a cat that doesn’t like it, touching a dog in a way that annoys them, etc.). 

And remember that every animal is an individual and has a different personality. Some animals don’t appreciate some kinds of connection with others, or have traumas to contend with that make their bonding take more time. Have expectations of your pets that are rooted in fairness and love, not ego or the expectation to be worshipped.

Last but not least, if your pet needs help, get them the appropriate help, as you would a friend. This will also help build trust.

My opinion is that animals don’t exist to worship humans, but my experience is that we can earn their love and affection through respect ❤️
