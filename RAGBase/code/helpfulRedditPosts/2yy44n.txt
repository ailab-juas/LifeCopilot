title:
LPT: If you have a dashcam, and you witness an accident, or you are involved in an accident, Read out loud the licence plate of the other car.

content:
Low quality recording or low light conditions might make it impossible for your camera to record the license plate of another car.
If you read it out loud, the audio should be clear enough for later use.
