Ysk Expect “strange” behavior from your friends and family this holiday season that may not be noticeable while interacting online. Especially those who live and work alone. Mental health issues, speech impediments, etc. can become worse when a person is isolated.

Why YSK: While this year has been hard on everyone, those who live/work alone may be going days or weeks without in-person interactions or even speaking. If a friend, family member, or loved one who has been isolated is spending time with you, it is because they care about you. Pointing out their “strange” (non-harmful) behavior will likely make them feel worse about something they’re aware of but struggling to control.
