YSK how to get fresh food at McDonald's and save some money as well

content:
Being a store manager at Mcdonald's, I've learned quite a few things that most people probably don't know about the restaurant but should. Here's a few tips and tricks if you will.

Fresh food: Unless you're getting food during a rush period (Often 11am-1pm and 5pm-7pm) or at a very high volume store, the fact is most of your food has probably been sitting in a UHC cabinet after it's throw-away period. While most McDonald's hold very high standards for food quality (I stress this greatly at my store) quite a few will just as well keep food longer merely to save on waste. To get quality food all the time here's some things to do.

- Ask for your meat with no salt. All burgers are sprinkled with a salt/pepper mixture after being cooked. Asking for it without salt will ensure your meat is freshly cooked. This rule applies to french fries and Filet O Fish as well. Any small meat (McDoubles) is around 40 seconds to cook, quarter meat (QP/Big n Tasty) is nearly 100 seconds, and angus meat is almost 3 minutes. 

- Fried chicken items (Nuggets, Crispy/Selects, McChicken) can be asked to made fresh, most stores won't have much fuss over it, as it gives them more time to prepare your food, it is often prepared better as well. Be aware that cooking times for nuggets and mcchicken patties are around 4 minutes, and crispy chicken items are nearly 7 minutes. 

Saving money: 

- Order a McDouble/Dbl Cheeseburger without ketchup and mustard, and have them add mac sauce and lettuce. You have a big mac and you've just saved yourself $2. You can also request it to be put on a seeded bun if you wish.

- The same can be done with their most horrible new creation, the Daily Double. It is merely a McDouble with mayo, tomato, onions and lettuce. It saves you quite a bit of money to just order as that. Around 60 cents. It amazes me how many people buy so many of these and don't realize it.

- Never buy a 10 piece nugget. Purchasing them as a 20pc or 4pc boxes is cheaper.

- You can order cooked onions on any of your items. We do this in the morning time for our steak egg and cheese bagel, and most places should do this for you. Usually take about 90 seconds on the grill to cook, but it's a nice change-up for your food sometimes, and also doesn't cost extra money.

- If you're eating inside the restaurant, order a sweet tea and simply fill it with soda. No one will ever know ;) Our employees waste more soda then who knows what.

- Removed because you're not suppose to put bad things on the internet, my mama said.


Well that's all, sorry for the length but hope some of you find it interesting/helpful!
