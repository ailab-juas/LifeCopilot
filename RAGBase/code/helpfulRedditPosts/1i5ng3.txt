title:
LPT: Measure and memorize your wingspan, lengths of forearm and hand, and width of palm. This knowledge can help you estimate measurements when needed.

content:
Your wingspan measurement (outstretched arms fingertip to fingertip) is approximately equivalent to your height, but this varies based on your body type.

edit: I'm not referring to memorizing your measurements for times when you are purchasing clothing, although it's useful for that purpose too. I'm talking about when you don't have a measuring device (ruler, tape, etc.) and need a quick approximate measurement of something.
