LPT: You will NOT be forgotten when you leave. Whether it's a relationship, a job or a friendship. Moving on is not the same as forgetting. Companies may forget, but people don't.

content:
I still think of my first love 20 years after seeing her last. I randomly will wonder about a dude I spent an entire awesome day with in Chicago and never connected with again. I still get referrals and phone calls from former bosses, owners, and colleagues. I reach out to attorneys and former employees who worked for me and now have their own practices/other careers. Sure, companies may forget, but you will be remembered. By managers, ex-lovers. Long gone friends. Moving on is not the same as forgetting. Never forget that. Your actions will dictate HOW you are remembered. Not if. Because while companies forget, people don't.
