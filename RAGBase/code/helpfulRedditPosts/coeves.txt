YSK If you're ever locked in an industrial freezer, you can disable the fans, thus stopling the freezer from staying cold and possibly saving your life

Happened to me today. A coworker locked the freezer (we just started doing so after a case of beer went missing) and he forgot to check inside first. I guess that's another YSK: CHECK THE DAMN FREEZER!!!

Edit: Stopping (Title)

Edit (2): You can disable any fan by turning the switch from on to off. Most switches are located directly below the fans. Sorry! First YSK!
