title:
YSK that a Dietician is licensed and a Nutritionist is not.

content:
Anyone can be a Nutritionist, while a Dietician typically has a nutrition degree in addition to a number of certifications. 

I learned this when I went to visit my school's Dietician as a student athlete. They were able to take my benchmark metrics and help me track my health goals.

Edit: For clarification I'm located in the good old USA. As a few people pointed out this isn't necessarily true in other countries so I think the lesson here is if your going to take advice on your diet, make sure they have formal accreditation.

Edit 2: So it sounds like Registered Dietician (RD) is the best title. -To be covered by a healthcare provider anyway.

Edit 3: Okay so I guess the PSATs just happened and there was an article about this in it. I bet a redditor more skilled than I can find it online.
