LPT: When negotiating a salary during a job interview, ASK FOR MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU SHOULD UPFRONT.

content:
After 4 rounds of interviews, I got a job offer! During the first interview they asked what salary I expected. I had already done my research so I knew what the industry standard/average salary was for the area. But I asked for more than that because I had good experience and qualifications. I knew  I was high-balling them and thought there was no way I was going to get as much as I asked for. Hopefully they'd meet me in the middle. That was the plan anyway.

Great news! They gave me EXACTLY what I asked for. No questions asked. No negotiations. Now I really wished I asked for even *more* upfront. I can't very well come back and say "oh wait...uh can I actually have more?..."

Ask for way too much. Then negotiate down.
