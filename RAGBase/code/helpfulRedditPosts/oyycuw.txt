LPT Never Get A Piercing Done With a Piercing Gun

content:
Seriously, don't do it. If they bring out a piercing gun, get out of there. Proper piercings should be done with a hollow needle which creates a small hole, not a tear. Imagine a piercing gun as shoving a pencil through a piece of paper and the needle as using a hole punch. *Especially* don't get a body piercing done with a piercing gun.
