LPT: if you struggle remembering if you locked the door or any such task, say something out loud or do something while doing it, you'll be able to recall yourself saying it and you'll know you did the task.

content:
If it's a daily repetitive task use something that has a sense, like the current day or date, so that you don't get confused about remembering yesterday remind-word.     
An unusual action can also be used, like knocking on the wall or taping your foot.  
By associating the task with physical movement and vocalization you'll be more conscious of doing it, more likely to remember it and more likely to do it right.    
The Japanese do this pointing-and-calling (*shisa kanko*) when making sure the tasks are complete and accurate and it has helped reduce workplace errors by up to 85%.
