title:
LPT: When eliminating a wasp nest, always do it at night.

content:
This is just something my father told me once.  I've only tried it once on a small nest. Anything bigger than your fist and I would recommend an exterminator.  Bare in mind that this is only for wasps.  Hornets fly at night and will rek yer shit.  

Edit:  Ye old Pea-beu...it's what bugs crave.

Edit:  If you are German don't kill bugs without checking with your legislature. And if you are American or Australian, its high noon and you should go McCree all over their (happy?) asses.
