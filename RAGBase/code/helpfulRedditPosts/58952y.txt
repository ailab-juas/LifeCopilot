LPT: How to de-escalate any argument and transform it into a discussion.

content:
This is so obvious, but I'm posting it because I *never* see it used.

Odds are your "opponent" in an argument will say at least one good counter to your stance. Tell them, "that's a good point." And think about it.

If they use your contemplative silence to expand on their good point, you now have more time to expand on your point of view.

Rinse and repeat.

You now are no longer arguing to be right, but are together on the path to truth! Also, mutual respect often will occur.
