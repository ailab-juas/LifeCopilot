[LPT] Servers, chefs, teachers, retail people, et.al.: How to properly choose your shoes for work, from a shoe salesman who's probably done your job before

content:
I am a 15-year professional fitter and seller of shoes of all types and over-the-counter orthotics. Before that, I spent eight of my younger years working every restaurant job there is except bartender. For the sake of your health and happiness, I'd like to share the smartest things you can do to protect your body from the most punishing obstacle it confronts on a daily basis: the floor.

1. **Whatever you buy, make sure it FITS.** An estimated 75% of Americans are wearing poorly fitted shoes. Improper footwear causes 60% of foot disorders. Every year, the US economy loses around $6 billion in foot injury-related lost-time events. Even if you wear cheap crap, make sure it is big enough.

2. But you deserve better than cheap crap. **Go to a reputable local shoe store and be fitted by an honest professional** who will stand you up on a Brannock device and measure your feet, the same way your grandparents used to buy their shoes, and bring you some suggestions. Let him do his job. If this store does not exist in your immediate area, invest a day off to make a road trip to wherever it is. You'll be glad you did. EDIT: [here's] (http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/30gotv/iama_floor_supervisor_at_a_shoe_carnival_store/) why you look for a reputable store and not a mass retailer. If the people there don't know how to help you, they make crap up - and make supervisor for their "efforts."

3. Once you have an idea of what fits, THEN try internet shopping, but remember: **the right size is whatever fits, and there are only two sizes, right and wrong.** Buy/keep whatever fits, regardless of the numbers stamped on the end of the box.

4. **Wear arch support.** This does not mean anything made of gel or squish, and this does not mean any product found at Walmart or the drugstore; Dr. Scholls is a quack, and his products are crap. This means firm, molded, anatomical support, from brands such as Superfeet, Sole, Spenco, Birkenstock, and others. They are to be found at reputable shoe stores, outdoor stores, and work shoe stores. **Get measured and fitted for them the same way you should for shoes.** They will feel like hard, lumpy foreign objects at first. They are. Keep the original insoles handy for the first few days at work, and swap back to them if your feet tell you to. The inserts will feel more comfortable for longer periods, until soon, you won't want to take them out. And you never will.

5. Protip: do not fit arch supports according to your shoe size, or your length measurement at the toe, but your arch length - the little slider on a Brannock device that goes against the ball of your foot. It is not unusual for this measurement to be a full size larger than your shoe size. It is on my foot. Remember that when buying an arch support, **you are not fitting the perimeter of your foot the way you do with a shoe, but fitting the contours of your foot underneath. That's a different ballgame.** The insoles that fit your arches and heels are usually longer than your shoe, and they will likely need to be trimmed. Use the factory insole as a template, trace it off with a pen, and trim the replacement insole neatly with a pair of the heaviest scissors you can find.

6. Protip #2: This is especially crucial if you work somewhere that requires you to buy a specific shoe brand, especially Shoes For Crews. I never wore them in the kitchen, but a customer of mine once described them as "absolutely the best non-slip sole in the business, attached to the crappiest shoe you will ever have on your foot." **They, like most shoes, including most "good" shoes, will get you through the day noticeably better if you hot-rod the undercarriage.**

7. Very, very, very, VERY few shoes come right out of the box with this sort of support. **It is your job to add it after the fact.** There are exceptions to that last sentence, notably Dansko, Birkenstock, and Naot, who also make some of the best and most indestructible shoes around.

8. **Quit complaining about the price and just spend the damn money already.** Your shoes are the single most important piece of equipment you will use all day. If you're not already doing some or all of the things I suggest, then I can tell you without hesitation: you absolutely will not believe the difference it will make in how you feel by the end of a long shift. I know I didn't. How I wish I knew what I know now, back when I was slinging hash for a living. I have worked 14 hour days on a shoe store sales floor, and left feeling better than I felt after a five hour shift in a kitchen, when I was 20 years younger. Spend wisely, and you'll feel every penny you invest. I guarantee it.

9. It is crucial to remember that no matter what you wear, no matter the dress code, when you work on your feet for extended periods, your shoes cease to become apparel. They are equipment. **Don't dress yourself - equip yourself.** Start with what your feet like, and allow your eyes/ego to make suggestions. If your feet like your eyes' suggestions, great - go for it. But don't get vain - do this with work shoes, and you'll find out why vanity is a deadly sin. Besides, if you're, say, a server, no one is going to notice your black shoes. They're going to notice whether they are served well by a cheery person who's on top of his/her game, or by someone visibly haggard who's gutting it out. The foot bone's connected to the attitude bone. The attitude bone's connected to the tips bone. Support one, support them all. **Your feet get first and last right of refusal on any shoe you wear to work for a long day on your feet. Your eyes, ego, and fashion sense will lead you astray.**

In your business, work shoes are a tool. And any workman will tell you not to skimp on your tools. This is how you get the very best tools for your job.

EDIT/UPDATE: I'm being bombarded with requests on how to help find a good shoe store in your area. Look on Yelp, Citysearch, etc. Look for glowing reviews, with phrases like "I haven't had my feet measured since I was a kid/never in my life/since Jimmy Carter was president!" and "I never knew my feet could feel so good!" and "_____ was an angel! I wish I'd been shopping with him/her long before now!" I don't live in your town. I don't know where that place is. Ask a local. Wherever it is, just GO THERE and let them take care of you. You'll be glad you did.
