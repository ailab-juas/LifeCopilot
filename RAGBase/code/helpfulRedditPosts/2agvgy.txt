LPT: How to remove almost any stain from almost any fabric (list of what you need is included)

content:
So recently I ran across [this page](http://web.extension.illinois.edu/stain/) listing a whole lot of common stains in fabric and how to remove them.
I wish i could've learnt this WAY before I did, it would have saved me a few shirts. Time to stock some of these items for the near future.
