LPT: If you make plans with a friend who has kids, don't stiff them at the last minute.

content:
Chances are, it's tough for them to get the night off from parenting and they're probably really looking forward to doing something other than parenting. It's also probably hard to find something else to do at the last second, because they probably don't talk to as many people as they did pre-kid(s). Seriously. Don't be a jerk. Give them a heads-up way in advance if you're going to bail.

This may fall under the "don't post things that are common courtesy" rule but, based on my experience, this courtesy isn't common.
