LPT: If you are feeling down and have a neighbour with a dog, see it you can take it for a walk. Dogs love to be walked and it can help out the neighbour too. You also get a new friend and go outdoors.

I've been having a tough time recently and doing this has helped me a lot. 

Edit: I just wanted to say that, even though they are just random internet points, it makes me feel good that this post did so well and that there have been so many nice comments. I hope that this advice might help someone. 

Also thank you for the comments about the animal shelters and the dog walking apps. I had not though about those options and they are great ideas!!

Thanks for the gold!
