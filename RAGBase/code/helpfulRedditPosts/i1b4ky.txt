LPT: If you are starting college this year and dealing with COVID closing schools, stay home and do online courses through a local community college to get your Gen Education requirements

content:
College is expensive (suppose this mostly applies to US schools). By getting those easy GenEd classes done online and for cheap, youâ€™ll get the most annoying part of a college degree out of the way for a fraction of the price. Since the state of in-person classes and colleges is up in the air right now, now is the best time to take advantage of a local community college for course credits.

EDIT: Definitely check to see what credits are available for transfer. Gen Ed courses are typically easy to transfer without issue. Certain courses such as a chemistry class for a student wanting to major in Chemistry may be difficult as schools want you to take courses with them instead. Check websites such as assist.org (for California schools) to see if credits are transferable.
