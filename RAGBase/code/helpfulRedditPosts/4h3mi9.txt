YSK : In America, there are small mile marker signs along the side of the freeways. Freeway Exit numbers indicate which mile marker you're at.

content:
That's why sometimes you'll end up with exit numbers that have alphabets at the end. Example : exit 234A, exit 234B, exit 234C are all exits within mile marker 234.
