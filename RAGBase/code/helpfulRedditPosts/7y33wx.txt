YSK that if you're job hunting, mention it to everybody that you can. You never know whose brother's neighbor's dog-sitter is hiring.

When I was trying to become a private investigator a few years ago, I wasn't having much luck. I was at my credit union for some reason unrelated to my job search and I was talking to one of the employees in her office. I mentioned my job hunt and her face lit up. She said that they have a client who runs her own PI firm and the CU handles all of their money. She said if I like, she will pass my info along to her next time she comes in. The employee kept her word, I got a phone call, then an interview, and voila! I was hired.
