LPT: Don't confuse "I have the right to freedom of speech" with "ONLY I have the right to freedom of speech"

content:
A: You're an ugly asshole.

B: Well I think you're an ugly asshole.

A: You can't talk back to me! I have the right to freedom of speech!

B: Yeah. So do I.

A: \*shocked Pikachu face.\*

I've seen lots of people cite freedom of speech (FOS) as justification for being rude without consequences. Now, I'm totally fine with people being rude, no big deal. But when people believe FOS prevents others from being rude in return, that's kinda stupid.

The logic usually goes "I can say shit about you (FOS for me), but you can't react with shit about me (no FOS for you)."

Have you guys had any experiences like this or have I just been unlucky haha :P

**EDIT 2021-10-13:** Thanks for all the interesting discussion, guys! And all the fun xkcd comics lol.

\- I realized I focused way too much on the hypocritical logic of Person A and not at all on their misunderstanding of FOS applying to **freedom from (American) government censorship** only.

\- This may not be an LPT for some people, but I wish someone emphasized this to me when I was a dumb kid and both accepted the FOS excuse and used it against others without thinking. Kids may be smarter these days, so they might not be as stupid as I was haha.
