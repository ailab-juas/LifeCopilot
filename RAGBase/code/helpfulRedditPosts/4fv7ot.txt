LPT: If a friend/colleague/acquaintance loses a loved one and doesn't tell you how they died, don't ask.

Title.  My father committed suicide in early 2015.  We share the same professional community and clients.  I still get clients who I haven't seen in a while ask about him, and when I inform them of his passing, they invariably ask how he died, to which I respond evasively or truthfully based on how close I am with the client.   It's still difficult, over a year later, for me to admit to some people that he took his own life.  But I'd say 90% of the people who learn from his passing immediately ask how.  I kind of thought this was common sense but experience suggests otherwise. 

I'm still surprised people ask this all the time without thinking first, but it screws with me every time, especially when I decide to be honest.  

If they want you to know, they'll volunteer the information.  If they don't right away, chances are they don't want to tell you.  


edit: This blew up overnight.  A number of people are saying this is too obvious to be an LPT, but my personal experience proves otherwise.  A similar number of people are saying this behavior is acceptable due to natural human curiosity. 

I would like to presume civility would out weigh curiosity more often than not, but you are free to disagree.  
I can discern between those who are making genuine inquiries based on their relationship with my father, and other people who are just nosy and inquisitive.  I'm always honest and forthcoming with the former.


And thank you all for the kind words and PMs.  If any of you are or have gone through something similar, I'm here for discussion as well.
