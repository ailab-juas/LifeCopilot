LPT: if a street performer is impressive enough to photograph/video, leave a tip.

content:
I’m not a performer, but I was always taught that if it impresses you enough for you to stop and appreciate it, leave a little something for them. That carries over to a current time where everyone has phones and we take more images and videos than ever before- if it’s worth documenting to share with your friends or post to social media, leave a tip for the performer.
