LPT: To avoid meat juice fingers at the grocery store, grab the plastic bag provided by the store, put your hand in the bag (like a glove) and grab your packaged meat. Flip the bag up over the meat and throw it in your cart. No meat juice fingers.

I don’t know that I have ever seen anyone else do this while shopping. People just be grabbing packages of meat and then going on their way. Maybe I’m weird… probably. But at least I don’t have meat juice fingers.
