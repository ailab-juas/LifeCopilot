YSK: Adopting a child is not like getting approved to adopt a puppy. It's a long and often heartbreaking process, and flippantly suggesting that someone 'just adopt' shows ignorance of that fact.

Why YSK: When I was younger, I really wasn't aware of this myself and so can't blame others for not being aware. But I've now seen friends go through the process, and looked into it myself (I've been interested for a long time in foster/adopting when my kids get older). I've also spent a good bit of time reading people's experiences here on reddit. An awful lot of people have this misconception that adoption is an easy default backup plan.

Adoption is a tough process. If you want a baby, odds are you've already been through the heartbreak of infertility. You have to go through education and approval, often pay a lot of money, and then still have a substantial risk of the birth parent backing out or worse, deciding they want the baby back after you've taken it home. (I can only imagine how awful that is). If you want to adopt non-infants, these aren't kids coming from pristine backgrounds here. They are almost always going to have special needs or mental baggage to work through; they may grow up and reject you and go back to their birth family. When you foster you have to accept that the kids are coming to you from bad situations (and sometimes from other bad foster homes), that you don't get to keep them forever, and that the real goal is to reunite them with the parent who lost them in the first place. 

It's not easy or pretty, and it's important to recognize that this isn't for everyone. Me, I'm mentally torn on whether it's even for me, and I always had said I was open to adoption.
