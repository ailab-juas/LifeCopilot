YSK before purchasing an item on Amazon that you're interested in, you can use a website called camelcamelcamel.com and see what the highest and lowest price had been.

content:
As the title states, I use this site to see if the price of something I am purchasing goes down in price any time of the year, especially computer components. If it's something I don't need right away, it saves me a good amount of money to be patient. You can also set price threshold alerts as well for yourself.
