LPT - Use the weekend to build the life you want, instead of trying to escape the life you have.

content:
A lot of us work Mondays to Fridays and dump all the negativity and pressure from the week during the weekends by escaping reality. Some party. Some use substances. 

But this won't change your life in the long run. You're only living in a loop. To break the cycle slowly use the time in your weekend to build something new. 

Small habits are underestimated. 

For example.

* Reading 20 pages a day is 30 books per year.
* saving 10 dollars a day is 3.650 dollars per year.
* running 1 mile a day is 365 miles per year.
* becoming 1% better per day is 37 times better per year.

Try not to let the bigger picture intimidate you. Lay a brick each day to build a new life. And if that's too much. Try it during the weekends.

And remember this. This helps me personally a lot.

Support yourself instead of finding ways to shit on yourself. It's impossible to win if you're not on your own team.
