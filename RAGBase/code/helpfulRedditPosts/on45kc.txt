YSK: never post pics of keys online

content:
Why YSK: lots of people post pictures of house keys in celebration of getting a new house or apartment, it's trivial and easy to make a copy of that key from the picture. You're literally giving your house key to the Internet. [It doesn't even have to be a photograph.](https://www.wfmynews2.com/mobile/article/news/man-swallows-truck-key-locksmith-uses-x-ray/83-403807108)
