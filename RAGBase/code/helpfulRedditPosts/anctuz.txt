LPT: If you and your partner are indecisive with everyday choices( eg dinner), try the 5,2,1 method. One of you pick 5, the other narrows it down to 2 and then the other picks 1.

This works really well with movies, food, tv shows, clothes etc. My partner and I have always struggled to decide, this has saved us so much time!
