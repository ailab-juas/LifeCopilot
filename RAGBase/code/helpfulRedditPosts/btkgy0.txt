YSK (UK) that if you don't have a £1 coin for the trolley at the supermarket, two 20p coins stacked on top of each other work too!

Found this out yesterday by accident when a trolley wouldn't accept a new £ coin so I had to improvise.

This may work in other countries depending on your trolley (shopping cart) rules haha. Over here they're all linked together so you have to put a coin in to release one. I think this was to avoid people stealing them as you only get your money back when you return it. 

But there is nothing more annoying than needing to do a big shop and you can't get a trolley.
