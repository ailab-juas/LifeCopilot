YSK cut nails straight across to prevent ingrown nails

Why YSK: Improper nail trimming is 1 cause of ingrown nails.

[Here's an example of how to cut them](https://puretherapyclinic.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/infection-after-ingrown-toenail-1.png)

Causes:

The etiology of ingrown toenails includes direct trauma to the toe that forces the nail corners into the surrounding nail fold, genetic predisposition, improper nail trimming, poorly fitting shoes, and constant and repetitive microtrauma from normal day-to-day activities. 

After a painful procedure this afternoon and now typing this with throbbing pain, I wish I have knew about this MUCH SOONER.
