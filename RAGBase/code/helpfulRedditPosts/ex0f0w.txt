title:
YSK When you get pulled over and the officer asks you “do you know why I pulled you over?” Always say NO

content:
If you tell them you know why they pulled you over, that is an admission of guilt. (If you ever want to fight the ticket in court)

Edit: yes obviously don’t just say “NO.” Be polite and say “no I’m sorry I do not know why you pulled me over today.”
