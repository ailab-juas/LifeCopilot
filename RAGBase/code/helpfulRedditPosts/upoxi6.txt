title:
YSK that Abbott is offering baby formulas that were previously on hold for free with a doctorâ€™s recommendation.

content:
If you are in need, call Abbott directly at 1-800-881-0876.

Why YSK: As all parents of infants in the US know, there is a terrible shortage of infant formula right now.  If you are in need, and your doctor will vouch for that, this could help you through the shortage.
