LPT: When highlighting text to copy from a webpage, you don't have to select and drag your mouse from start to end. Just click the mouse at the starting point, then use SHIFT+CLICK at the end of the selection.

Clicking the position at the start of the selection is like setting an invisible cursor.  Seems to work on all web browsers on PC and Mac according to my tests.
