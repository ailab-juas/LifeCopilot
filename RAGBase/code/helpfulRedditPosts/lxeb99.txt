YSK: That if you're in public and in a rush to find a restroom, before you risk a gas station bathroom you should look for home depots or a target, both usually have clean restrooms that are open to customers and don't have security codes to get in.

Why YSK: Because in this situation most people will look for a gas station or restaurant first but because of current world situations those places have shut their restrooms down. Home depot and target are all over the place and can be easily found. To that extent walmart qualifies for this post too but they tend to be dirtier.
