LPT: add your vehicle as a contact in your phone, to keep their details organized and accessible. Details like: license plate, VIN, address/phone/email of dealership, insurance number, financing information (including maturity date), tire sizes and PSI.

Edit - I added this as a comment reply but will put it here as well:

So I’m on iPhone, and my format is:

First Name: Ford F-150

Last Name: Lariat Supercrew (2022)

Nickname: License Plate Number

Phone: dealer phone number

Email: dealer email

Address: dealer address

URL: vehicle manual

Birthday: loan maturity date 

I use the ‘Instant Message’ section for things like VIN, insurance number, etc. When editing that section you can customize the header, so it just reads:

VIN: 123456

Insurance: 78910

Registration Permit: 111213

Etc


It looks really clean and simple in this format. Then I use notes at the bottom for other stuff like oil type, tire info, vehicle height.
