YSK, most overdose deaths occur when the user is in some room all alone, dead. Never use alone.

Why YSK:

You should know this because even if you yourself don't currently use illicit drugs, you know someone that does, or there is someone relatively close to you that does.

Not having someone by your side when you hit the floor is not a mistake anyone makes twice.

It was the day after Thanksgiving in 2018 when I got one of those phone calls everyone dreads receiving.

They called to tell me that my Dad was found in his living room, all alone, dead.

Any drug user can call or visit;

# (800) 484-3731

# [neverusealone.com](https://neverusealone.com)

They will stay on the phone with you until you are finished using. If you don't respond for a predetermined amount of time, they will call an ambulance to the location that you gave them.

They're not going to badger you, disrespect you, or discuss any type of treatment.

They just want you to LIVE and so do I.

(I am in no way advocating for illegal activity. I am merely advocating for my fellow humans to live as long as possible.)

(side note to all humans: stop the stigma, please.)
