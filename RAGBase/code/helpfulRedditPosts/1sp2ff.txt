LPT: COLLEGE STUDENTS - "It's not the grades you make, it's the hands you shake"

content:
This really got me a job out of college and helped me stress less during finals.  Moreover, it helped me realize the big picture of everything. I majored in History and now have a really awesome, well paying job in PR because I opened my mouth and asked questions, thereby extending my network.

edit- obviously grades are important, but for me, it was networking that was WAY more important.
