LPT: When leaving a voicemail message, state your name and number twice. It may seem repetitive, but it’s super helpful for the other person

content:
Picked this habit up a while ago when I worked phones and had to leave a lot of messages. Glad I still do it. 
When leaving a voice mail message for someone I’ll say, “Hi this is [name] small blah blah and you can get back to me at [number], once again that’s [name] [number]. Thank You” 
I’ve genuinely had people tell me that it’s helpful, and start doing it themselves.

[Edit] Good form is to also speak slowly or half/speed.
