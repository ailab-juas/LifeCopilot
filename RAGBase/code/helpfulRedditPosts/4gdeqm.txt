LPT: How to get a cab if they keep denying you a ride due to your destination being to far away.

content:
If you're in a nightlife area of a major city and need a ride to the suburbs or to city limits, most taxi drivers will deny you a ride once you tell them your destination. They want to stay in the areas with most business to maximize rides during peak hours. So to get around this walk to nearest big hotel that's within this nightlife area and hail one of the cabs waiting out front. You might have to enter the hotel from parking garage and exit through main lobby. They have deals with the hotels to provide their guests rides and turning them down jeopardizes their permission to wait outside the hotel. They will think you're a guest and comply no matter what your destination is. 

If you're ballsy enough you can even ask a bellhop to hail a cab for you. As long as you're exiting the lobby they will assume you're a guest and oblige and you'll get a cab guaranteed. 

Edit: This worked for me during Mardi Gras in New Orleans years before ride sharing. I saw someone mention uber was banned in their city so I thought this could help people in those cities or in cities during huge events where there's dozens of people wanting cabs so they have plenty of other people to give a ride with shorter and more profitable trips.

#Uber, Lyft or any other ride sharing service is absolutely a better option if available in the area.
