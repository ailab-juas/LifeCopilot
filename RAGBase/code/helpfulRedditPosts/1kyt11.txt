LPT: Parents of 7 to 16 year olds can make their children behave in public by threatening to sing loudly

content:
I read something years ago about a girl who was totally embarrassed by her dad singing as they walked through a mall. The dad in question was Billy Joel. So if a guy who was/is paid millions to sing can embarrass his daughter by singing I figured I would certainly make my kids want to crawl into a hole.

Flash forward to when I have kids. We were at Disney World and the usual sibling squabbling starts. Suddenly I remember and say in a loud sing-songy voice 'Boys. if YOu don't Stop FighTING I will TALK like this ALL DAY!"

Success! Well behaved kids with just a "Boys...MMmmmMMmmm" for the rest of the trip.

*MAJOR EDIT*

As others have noted there is a magic age, which is different for each kid where this starts to not be effective. 12 seems like where it started wearing off for my kids. But it works a bit even now that they are older.

Also I didn't sing songs. I sang whatever I needed to say. "HEY Look aT The the PRICE of those TOmatoes. THAT'S a deal and A HAlfff" No singing along with this.

Embarrassment in children isn't a bad thing in the right amount. It'll maybe help them from doing stupid crap later in life.


Lastly, would you rather hear that or "GOD DAMN IT! I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE! I HAVE TOLD YOU TWO TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO STOP WITH THE GOD DAMN PICKING ON EACH OTHER. ONE MORE WORD OUT OF EITHER OF YOU AND SO HELP ME GOD I WILL KNOCK YOU BACK TO LAST TUESDAY!  NOW SHUT THE HELL UP FOR A GOD DAMN CHANGE!  jesus christ I don't get it."? I heard and done both.

The singing thing sounds and works better.
