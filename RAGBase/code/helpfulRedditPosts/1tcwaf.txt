LPT: Hold down CTRL key when in Task Manager to freeze the list

content:
Just found it in Windows 8, got a friend to try it in Windows 7 and it works there too. Pretty useful if you got refresh speed at fast and you're trying to track a process with spiky CPU usage.  
  
edit: if you use Process Explorer by Sysinternals you can press Space to toggle pause, however if you're using this tool in the first place you probably know keyboard shortcuts :)
