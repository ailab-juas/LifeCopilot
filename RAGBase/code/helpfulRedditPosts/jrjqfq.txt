LPT - Place your cat’s drinking water away from their food source. Instinctually, cats hunt away from their food source because evolution taught them prey can contaminate their water.

My 13 year old cats drink water all day long now that I’ve separated the two. After a few months of this, I got one of those fancy fountain style units too and they LOVE it. 

EDIT: As pointed out by u/Healing__Souls - cats hunt away from their water source as they know that carcasses can contaminate the water.

EDIT 2: As pointed out by u/Kidbeninn - excessive drinking can be a sign of heath issues such as kidney disease, if you think this is the case call your vet!
