LPT - If someone you care about tells you about something they are excited, anxious, etc. about, set a reminder for that day to give them encouragement or support before it happens. It only takes a few seconds and might mean a lot to them.

I tried to do this a lot in 2021 and it makes both parties feel good.  Examples:

* A friend was interviewing for a job they really wanted in October, so I set a reminder for the day of the interview and sent them a message in the morning to wish them luck.

* Another friend recently had to take her son in for a brain scan that she was very worried about, so I set a reminder and sent a message first thing in the morning wishing her luck with the scan and offering to be there if she needed anything.

* My dad told me he had bought a new motorcycle and that it was being delivered the following week.  Set a reminder and sent a message asking if he got it and was happy with it.

Everyone seemed grateful for the messages, and having to rely on notifications/reminders for these kinds of things doesn't make you less of a friend/family member than if you had remembered on your own.
