To those saying keep a tool box, I get it. You and thousand other people have already said that. If you have a well organized toolbox, good for you. This tip wasn't meant for you. 
To the people who say don't use duck/duct tape, fair point. You can use whatever tape works for you. The concept is same. 
Thanks for the gold, kind stranger.
