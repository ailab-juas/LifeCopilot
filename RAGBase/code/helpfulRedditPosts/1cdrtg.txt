LPT: Leave for work 20 minutes earlier than you need to - Every day.

content:
The benefits are multiple.

20 minutes of extra time to listen to music.

You never get to work flustered, worried if you'll make it on time.

Minor traffic problems won't cause you stress - you're prepared.

If there is a snafu at home while you are getting ready, you have 20 extra minutes to recover before actually leaving late (e.g. - cant find keys, spill coffee and have to change clothes...)

I'm sure there are more benefits, but these are the ones that help me the most on a daily basis.

Thanks for reading!

TL:DR - A wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.

EDIT:  Awesome!  Frontpaging on a nonstandard subreddit w00t w00t g0t r00t!

EDIT2: I should have written this more clearly.  The plan is not to leave for work 20 minutes earlier for the sake of working for free.  The point is to make a plan to leave early for the purpose of doing something wholesome like listening to music -  this benefits you personally.  Then, if something comes up (a flat tire, traffic accident that diverts your course, etc), you aren't penalized by your employer - you only missed out on some music time.
