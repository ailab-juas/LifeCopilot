LPT: For those who don't know how to respond when receiving a compliment: the simplest response is to say thank you, followed by an interesting fact on the subject or your feelings on the matter.

content:
For example: if someone says they like your shirt

"Thank you! I found it at a thrift store for $5." Or "Thank you, it always makes me feel pretty/confident/handsome!"

You can even say thank you and return a compliment in kind if you're up for it. Everyone needs a compliment every now and then.
