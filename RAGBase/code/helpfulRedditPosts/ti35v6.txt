YSK: freeairpump.com lists every place around you where you can get free air for your tires or air tank.

content:
Why YSK? Because some of us are poor, living pay check to pay check, but most of us have smartphones and you should look at that website before you just go and hand over your hard earned money.

Of course, if you have a flat, please don't drive to far on it. You *will* destroy the side walls of your tire. They Source: am professional mechanic.

Edit: it has been stated over and over again that California has to give free air. Connecticut also must give free air. Everywhere else in the US charges money and, no, you can't just ask to get free air and no, there is no button to bypass paying.

Edit 2: this post is for people that can't afford to buy even a cheap air compressor for their car. And remember, they give free smartphones out now with free minutes and free data, so saying "if you can afford a smartphone, you can afford a compressor" is not a good suggestion.

Edit 3: tire shops will fill your tires up for free if they are open. They may even patch your tire for free too, as long as it's in the tread.
