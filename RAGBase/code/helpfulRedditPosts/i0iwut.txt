LPT: Never use the kettle from your hotel room, you have no idea what it is used for.

content:
My brother works in a hotel in Amsterdam, and he comes home with the craziest stories. 

He told me that guests almost exclusively use the kettle for other purposes then making tea. 

The kettle is frequently used to cook rice, warm up small towels and clean/wash underwear. 

A lot of hotels don’t expect guests to do this (and aren’t aware of this behavior) and don’t ‘deep’ clean the kettles. 

For your own personal hygiene, avoid using the kettles in hotel rooms.
