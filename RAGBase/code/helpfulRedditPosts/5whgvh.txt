LPT: If your SO can't make a decision about where to eat, play the 5-2-1 game. You give them 5 restaurants, they pick two, and you pick from those.

My gf of 3 years is the queen of "wherever" and "I don't care" when it comes to this. This little game fixed our problem immediately. It takes the pressure off of her, but still gives her a choice about where to eat. 

(this can also work with kids and indecisive friends)
