LPT: Don't judge your "market value" as a romantic partner during your teenage years/ early twenties. A lot of decisions during that time are hormone-driven.

content:
Adolescence lasts much longer than most people think, until around 25. Before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. Thus, our "true personality" only manifests itself during the late twenties.

Before that happens, people are often "in lust" rather than in love, but without realizing it. Our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young. This can lead to our relationship decisions in high school and sometimes college being based on biological urges rather than compatibility of personalities.

So don't worry if you can't find a partner in high school or even college - the good times are still ahead of you!

EDIT: to clarify, I'm not saying not to date until you're older, just to not let yourself be discouraged by setbacks in your love life.
