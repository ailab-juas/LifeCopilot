YSK Your kid wanting to explain their side is not talking back

content:
"I want to talk to you about what happened today."
"Ok, but first can I explain my side?"
"Absolutely not! You're going to listen to what I have to say about what happened today."
"Please mom, it will be better if I talk to you-"
"See that's what I'm talking about! You can't even listen to me for a few minutes without talking back or having an attitude. Go upstairs."
A few hours go by
"You're just going to sit in your room all day without hanging out with us?"
What is your kid supposed to say without feeling threatened?

Parents, let your kids voice be heard without them feeling scared to talk to you.
