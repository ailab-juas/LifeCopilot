title:
LPT: Never underestimate the power of ignoring someone

content:
Ive avoided tons of fights, confrontations and rude people just by simply ignoring them. Yes it seems like a cowardly move, but the payoff is huge. Showing someone you simply dont care about their absence is the ultimate insult. You simply can live a peaceful life without issue once you learn to not care about others or their issue with you.
