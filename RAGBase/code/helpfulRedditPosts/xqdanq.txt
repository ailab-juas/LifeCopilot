title:
LPT: before a major storm, fill up a bathtub or buckets with water.

content:
In the event that the water goes out, youâ€™ll be able to fill the toilet with water for flushing of toilets.

Best of luck, good vibes, prayers, thoughts etc to those that will be impacted by Hurricane Ian.

Additional LPT: if you are stuck and hunkering down in a potential storm surge area, have an axe on hand in case you have to shelter In an attic (many people have died doing this - do whatever you can to not end up in the attic). If the water rises further and you are there, you may need to cut through to the roof.

Edit: as many have stated, the real LPT is to not let yourself be caught in a major hurricane where you would need any of these tips. Heed evacuation warnings in hurricanes. Storm surge is absolutely deadly.
