LPT: When offering guests drinks, don't ask if they'd like something. Instead, ask if they'd prefer beverage A, B, or C.

content:
Letting them know what's available prevents that awkward situation where you have nothing they want, but they've already accepted the offer and have to sip at something they don't like.

Most people won't mind saying, "I'm fine, thank you" if they aren't thirsty or don't like the options.
