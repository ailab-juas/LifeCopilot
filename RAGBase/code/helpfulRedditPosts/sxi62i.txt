LPT: Place a towel down to reduce anxiety for a pet being bathed

content:
While water is a big stressor, part of why animals freak out is the lack of grip they get in the tub. Adding a towel to the floor before you run the water can give your dog or cat something to grip onto, rather than slipping around and causing more of a freakout.
