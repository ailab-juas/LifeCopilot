LPT: How to get rid of mold on your bathroom ceiling

content:
Our bathroom has some black mold on the ceiling and it was very tough to get rid of, but after some trial and error, i think we figured it out. 

We don't have a bathroom fan, so we started by showering with the bathroom door open. Go to your local hardware store and get this soap concentrate stuff called Odoban. Apply Odoban and let it soak in for about 15-30 minutes. Then take a hard-bristled brush and scrub away.

To keep the mold from coming back, when you pick up that Odoban, also pick up a pack of Damp Rid (or DIY it, if ya know how). These are basically a plastic bag with some kind of sand-like compound that attracts moisture out of the air and deposits it in another compartment. this keeps the moisture from forming mold. 

This worked pretty well for us, and I thought I'd share.
