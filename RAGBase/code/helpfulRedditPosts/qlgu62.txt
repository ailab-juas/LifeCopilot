title:
LPT: it is better to risk being shot at a primary location, than allowing yourself to be taken to a second location.

content:
If someone is attempting to kidnap you, or take you anywhere under duress, scream. fight. rage. DO NOT COMPLY.

there is absolutely nothing that person can do to you in that moment that will be worse than what you will face if you go to a second location. even if you are shot, your chances of survival are FAR higher somewhere you may receive medical aid. and even if the worst happens, not only are you almost certainly sparing yourself a far more horrific journey to that same end, but you also greatly increase the chances of the puke being caught, possibly preventing future victims. even acknowledging that, it is far more likely that raising an alarm will both scare off an attacker expecting a compliant victim, as well as attracting the attention of those who will come to your aid.

been on something of a murder/mystery binge of late. and victims hoping they will be spared if they comply, as well as investigations hitting dead ends when there was an unknown second location, are themes i see across 99% of such stories. fight back, loudly and without reservation; if you do you can probably prevent your murder, or failing that you can prevent it from being a mystery.
