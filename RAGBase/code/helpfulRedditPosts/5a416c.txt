To stop the room spinning when you've had too much alcohol and you go to bed, put one leg out the side of your bed with your foot flat on the floor and one hand on something solid like the bedpost/ bedhead.

When you've had "one" too many, and you lie down it can upset your balance, make your head spin and ultimately cause you to vomit. If you use the tip above it allows your body to re-calibrate your balance. 
Sitting up slightly, turning a light on and focusing on a stationary object also helps.


Alcohol upsets the fragile mechanism that theÂ inner ear uses to balance.

This tip will reduce the effect enough for you to go to sleep 


Edit: For those saying it's bullshit there are lots more saying it works...
It works for me and most others...but it has its limits obviously..depending on how shitfaced you are...and if you really need to puke.. don't fight it... get it out..this tip is to avoid getting to that point

Edit 2: I can't believe how many of you actually enjoy and embrace the SPINS! fair enough guys you're mental :)

Edit3:Jesus wept.......
I'm not saying this will work for people slipping into comas... if you are slipping into a coma..make sure you're lying in the recovery position... This is for if you're a bit drunk and feeling a bit spinny.

Edit4: some people questioning how you could be so irresponsible and immature as to let yourself get drunk..(think someone let them out of r/ImPerfect  )...
 It happens from time to time if you're normal...
