LPT: Having trouble getting up in the morning? Try leaving the blinds open.

content:
For the last year I have been either groggy in the morning, hitting the snooze button or have had that "shocking" feeling when my alarm wakes me up.

Last night I left my curtains drawn and I woke up this morning completely relaxed and not wanting to hit snooze.

I looked it up and sunlight basically tells your body that it should stop sleeping, which totally makes sense but I know a lot of people, including me, who like to sleep with the blinds closed.

Sorry if you don't have a window or sun when you need to wake up, but I did a quick search for something to replace that effect and this looks promising: http://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/HF3470_60
