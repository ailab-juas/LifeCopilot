YSK hot showers could be causing your acne/skin problems.

Why YSK: If you have stubborn acne, especially body acne such as back or chest, it could be related to hot water and no one has ever told me this may be a cause for acne. 

DISCLAIMER: This is speaking purely from personal experience. I’m not claiming this is an absolute fix for all cases, but I found success with this and wanted to share for those who would like to try it. 

I suffered from insanely stubborn and severe back acne for about a decade, past puberty and into my mid 20’s.
I visited dermatologists repeatedly and tried different solutions, including Accutane. Accutane worked wonders for my face, but had little effect on my back. 
After years of spending money and seeing no results, I tried experimenting on my own and changing parts of my routine. 
I didn’t see many results until I tried changing the temperature of my showers.
I tried taking hot showers but not letting any hot water touch my back. I’d gradually move to colder water at a comfortable pace until it felt cool, then I’d allow contact onto my back. 
By the third day of this, my back had literally cleared like 60%. 
I’ve been doing this for about 3 years now and my back is infinitely better. By this point, I actually dislike the feeling of hot water on my back and love the way the cold water makes me feel in general. 
I’ve never been suggested this by any dermatologist I’ve visited. I’ve heard of other benefits from cold showers though I can’t vouch for them, I’m inclined to believe it’s beneficial to some degree based off my own experience.
