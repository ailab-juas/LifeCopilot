LPT: Do not post anonymous images of your mail online with only the street address redacted.

I've seen this a lot lately, [sample image](http://imgur.com/Da0NTAU)

The USPS has coded exact address information into the new barcodes used on mail, which can be deciphered using an [app similar to this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.avimobile.mailscan.activity&amp;hl=en). If you must post the image, black out the barcode also.


DO NOT UNKNOWINGLY GIVE YOUR ADDRESS INFORMATION ON THE INTERWEBS!!!

Leave^that^to^the^NSA.
