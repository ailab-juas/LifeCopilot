YSK that the hymen is not an indicator of virginity and that it is NOT normal for sex to hurt

content:
I find it frustrating that even today you see things about how a woman having a hymen means she's a virgin. Or how it's "normal" for sex to hurt, especially the first time. No and no! If sex hurts, speak to a doctor. It shouldn't hurt, even the first time.

Gynecologist Jennifer Gunter explained this best (the sub won't let me link):

"The hymen is a left over collection of cells that typically partially occludes the vaginal opening. Many mammals have hymen. Humans, dogs, cats, camels, elephants etc. if this were for marriage/a social construct of virginity then other mammals would not have them. 

The hymen is more rigid at birth and provides more covering for the first 3 years to keep urine and feces out of the infant vagina, which lacks estrogen so is very sensitive to irritants. 

When most children become continent coincides with the time the hymen starts to take on different shapes and flexibility because evolution no longer cares. 

Yes, the hymen is like baby teeth. It served a biological purpose for a narrow developmental window and then when no longer needed is discarded. 

The hymen is no virginity indicator, 50% of sexually active teens do not have a disrupted hymen. The hymen is often very flexible. 

What about blood stained sheets on the wedding night? 2/3 of women have no bleeding with first coitus and for those who do it is usually spotting. The hymen does not have a rich blood supply. Blood stained sheets come from sexual trauma. 

Also 2/3 of women have no pain with first coitus. 

Some people think the hymen would tell a man if the wedding night baby was his. Um, no. Chance of conception from single act of sex 2-5%, for most of evolution mortality in 1st year very high. Evolution doesn’t invest in 1-2.5% chances. Also, if paternity were evolutionarily so important, why invest in the first baby only? Or why not have an elephant’s hymen that only breaks in childbirth? 

The hymen means nothing physically and hymen exams are medically not a thing and are unnecessary. And support a disgusting patriarchal trope."

Edit: Let me clarify as my title may not have been phrased perfectly. First time sex hurts for 1/3 of women. That's the minority. However, just because 1/3 of women feel pain doesn't mean they should. [Sex should not hurt.](https://www.drgreene.com/qa-articles/sex-should-not-hurt) There's a difference between pain and discomfort. But the medical community agrees that sex should not hurt. [Reasons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/style/sex-pain-causes-solutions.html) for pain can be due to lack of foreplay or lube. Because it's too rough or fast. Because of a minor or serious medical condition. All in all, we should not normalize painful sex. We should not tell girls to power through the pain of their first time. Take your time, communicate, and try to determine why there is pain. Stop telling boys and girls that it's totally normal for sex to hurt. And of course, if sex hurts every time you should 100% see a doctor.
