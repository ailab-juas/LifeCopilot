YSK that US hospitals were required to comply with the Price Transparency rule starting January 1st, and you can report your hospital for non-compliance.

content:
&gt; Report a hospital for non-compliance [**here**](https://cms.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2fAQwrDLIC7Iyx)

Why YSK: PatientRightsAdvocate.org estimates [that less than 6% of hospitals are compliant](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60065b8fc8cd610112ab89a7/t/60f1c225e1a54c0e42272fbf/1626456614723/PatientRightsAdvocate.org+Semi-Annual+Hospital+Compliance+Report.pdf). You can report your hospital for non-compliance  to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services [here](https://cms.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2fAQwrDLIC7Iyx), they can be fined for each day they are noncompliant.

[To be compliant, a hospital must make **all** of the following information publicly available on their website](https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency/hospitals) (they can't require you to email them for the information, or require an account, password, or fee):

1.)  Single **machine-readable digital file** containing the following standard charges for all items and services provided by the hospital: 

* gross charges

* discounted cash prices 

* payer-specific negotiated charges

* de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges.

2.) Display of at least 300 “shoppable services” (or as many as the hospital provides if less than 300) that a health care consumer can schedule in advance. **Must contain plain language descriptions of the services** and **group them with ancillary services**.
