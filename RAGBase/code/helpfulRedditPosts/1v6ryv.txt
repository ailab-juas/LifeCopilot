LPT: If your municipality declares a boil order for tap water, make sure to turn off your ice cube maker or you could run into problems days or even weeks later.

Self explanatory.

Edit: Sorry, not that self explanatory it turns out. I thought this was common.
In my city (in Canada), this happens whenever there is heavy rain fall. 

#Definition via Wikipedia:

A boil-water advisory or boil-water order is a public health advisory or directive given by government or health authorities to consumers when a community's drinking water is, or could be, contaminated by pathogens.
