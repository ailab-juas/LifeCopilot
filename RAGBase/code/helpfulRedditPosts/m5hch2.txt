LPT: Don’t buy a knife block with 8+ knives because it seems like value for money. They’ll be worse quality and you realistically only need 3.

Knives definitely follow the rule of “quality over quantity”. People get bamboozled by the 15 knife set that sometimes has multiples of the same knife (I’m not talking about steak knives, I appreciate that’s a different thing). 

Realistically, you only really need three: bread, paring and chef. These will cover almost everything you’d want to do in the kitchen. Spend the same amount you’d spend on a bigger set on a smaller, better quality set and you won’t regret it. They’ll last for ages, stay sharper longer and won’t get cruddy and chip.
