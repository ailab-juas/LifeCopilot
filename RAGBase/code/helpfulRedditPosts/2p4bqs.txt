title:
YSK that choking is silent.

content:
This is really for parents. I will never forget something a CPR teacher told me when we were pregnant with our first child. Choking is silent. Think about it.. coughing equates to air movement. So does gasping.

Kids don't know how to come tell you, and/or they are locked into a high chair when they eat.

Always supervise your kids when eating, and don't assume that silence means everything is all good.
