title:
LPT: Parents, the greatest thing you can ever give your children is the gift of good eating habits.

content:
While not overweight myself, my siblings are on the bigger side: it isn't sheer coincidence that my parents are also bigger.  Whatever eating standards that you set for yourself will most likely be followed by your children.  Yes, most foods available (in America) are unhealthy, and the healthy foods are usually more expensive. Still, avoiding the purchase of junk food when your children are young could extend their lives by decades, not to mention the benefit to their social lives and ability to find a SO.

Edit: "Greatest" was a little dramatic.
