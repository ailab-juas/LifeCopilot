LPT: Instead of Buffalo Wild Wings consider Chinese carryout wings. It's not only cheaper but less of a time waster.

content:
15 traditional wings at BWW runs $18.79 near my home. Many Chinese carry out places serve deep fried wings, just as fat and meaty, for cheaper. Bring them home and coat them in your own buffalo sauce. While it's cost effective, it may save you a lot of time. The last few times I have ordered wings online at BWW for pickup, I had to wait additionally,  in a line with GrubHub, Uber Eats and other delivery service drivers who were also delayed because of the shortage of staff at popular casual dining establishments. Chinese carryouts tend to be Mom and Pop and quick with your order.
