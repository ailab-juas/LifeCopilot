title:
YSK that in 18 states plus Puerto Rico, ALL adults are mandated reporters

Edit:

**What is a mandated reporter:**

&gt;The Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment 
Act (CAPTA) requires each State to have provisions 
or procedures for requiring certain individuals 
to report known or suspected instances of 
child abuse and neglect

-----

Those states are:

Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, 
Texas, Utah, and Wyoming


-----

**Why YSK** - Most people know that teachers, school employees, daycare workers, and the like are mandated reporters but most do not know that they themselves may very well be one, as well.

All 50 states have mandated reporting statutes, most are limited to certain professions (beyond just teachers) and some (the ones above) expand it to all adults.
