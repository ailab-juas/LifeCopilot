title:
LPT Amazon Prime Day "Sales"

content:
Before buying something on Amazon Prime Day, do a quick internet search to make sure an item is *actually*  on sale. Amazon is adjusting prices on items to then discount them to  the original price. For instance, the Xbox Series X is currently listed  as 16% off ($499.99 with the discount) and they are claiming the  original price is $592.97. The original price is actually $499.99. You  aren't saving anything.

Edit: for those of you mentioning the Xbox Series X is listed as $499.99 with no discount, you are correct. It appears Amazon removed the 16% off from the listing. I have screenshots and archived the webpage locally earlier today.
