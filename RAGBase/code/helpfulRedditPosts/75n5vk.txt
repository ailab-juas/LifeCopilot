YSK Olive Garden, Applebee's, and other restaurants charge a "table game fee" if you play a game on their tablets

content:
Was at Olive garden waiting for food today while I started checking out the tablet they had on the table where you could order food, pay the bill, and play games. I had never seen one so I decided to check out a game. Played one level and closed it out. When I got the bill I noticed a $1.99 charge for "table games". Whatever warning there was, I didn't notice. The kid at the table next to us was playing with it to, and it makes me wonder just how many people are getting charged and not realizing it. 

EDIT: lol ya'll I wasn't calling for the CEO of Olive Garden to be burned at the stake....I was just pointing this out so other people might not make my same mistake and you guys are really going at it down there...
