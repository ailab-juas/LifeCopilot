LPT: If ever visiting Ireland, save lots of money by staying at a Bed &amp; Breakfast and have a better experience

content:
Firstly, I don't own or have any interests in any B&amp;Bs.

I hate when I see tourists staying at soulless hotels dotted around motorways. I don't know if it's the same in other countries but, in Ireland we have really high quality Bed &amp; Breakfasts that cost a third of the price of a shit hotel. They're often family owned and run by people who REALLY care that you enjoy your stay. They have their homes and livelihoods invested in that. 

I have had so many great experiences:

* The owner of a B&amp;B I stayed at in Limerick had a daughter that worked for a large US airline. I was travelling on that airline the following week. She rang her daughter to, and no word of a lie, "put in a good word" for me. I was upgraded to **first** class. Mental.
* Another B&amp;B owner fucking serviced my car!! Well, he did an oil change and checked the brakes etc.. He's a mechanic and was doing his kid's car so did mine as well

You often meet crazy/funny/lovely/honest people running these places and to me they represent the best we have.

I'll shut up now. Wall of text and it won't get a blind bit of notice :)
