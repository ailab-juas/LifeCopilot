Next time your about to sign up for a gym membership... back out right before you sign any contracts, observe your monthly fees decrease.

I was at Golds Gym the other day, and I pretty much got hustled into a 2 year contract paying $35 a month! (they did give me 2 months free, which seemed great to me.) But I went home, and my friends kept telling me I got ripped off, he only pays $20 a month. 
**Another pro-tip** is that **most contracts have a 3 day grace period** (check by state.) So I went to Golds the next day and asked to remove my contract. At first I was offered another free month, than I was offered $25 a month plus the free extra month. I told them I was in college and didn't want to commit to a 2 year contract. So I was offered 3 months free for $25 a month and I'm not bound by any contract, only paying month by month. 

I was shocked at how desperate and cooperative they were when I showed no interest, I had the manager talking to me and trying to work out a better deal. 
Hopefully this helps next time you think about joining a gym...
