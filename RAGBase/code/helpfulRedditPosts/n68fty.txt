title:
YSK that if you put your finger inside your dog's lip and it is dry, they are most likely dehydrated.

content:
Why YSK: if your dog is dehydrated just 2% it can feel like  the equivalent of having a hang over. This is mainly for ageing or movement impaired dogs. It can mean (this is all according to my vet fyi) they do not have the energy/strength anymore to take care of their basic daily needs and can lead to discomfort or pain.

Taking them to water more often or leaving numerous drinking holes for them can also be an option. Just be aware.

I say this because tomorrow I will  lay to rest my 5 y.o pupper. She was a Kelpie x with a degenerative nerve issue that impaired the growth of her muscles, which eventually meant she lost the use of her back legs. She still seemed perfectly happy and would love to go out dragging herself around. We knew it was coming (due to the condition she has) but didn't realise her quality of life was already below where it should be. 

Disclaimer: can't confirm above applys to cats or other pets. I presume it does though.

Shoutout to my awesome vet and all the veterinarians out there, having to be there for the final moments of people's loved ones would be rough x
