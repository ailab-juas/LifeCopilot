LPT: A different way to get the stink out of your shoes.

content:
I wanted a clean way to to get the stink out of a pair of shoes without freezing them. So, I put some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and sprayed the inside of the shoes enough to cover the insoles, then left them overnight to dry. Today they just smell like shoes. No stink. It makes sense, as shoe funk is caused by bacteria, and bacteria is killed by alcohol. In fact, hand sanitizer is often just alcohol in a gel suspension. So I guess this is like shoe sanitizer.

I did a quick search in /r/LifeProTips and didn't find this recommendation, but I may have just missed it, so sorry if this is a repost.

Edit: As it turns out /u/Zwei2stein did mention this in another post about a week ago.  He also went into a lot more detail on the topic.  [Check out his post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1v9q41/lpt_battling_smelly_feet_effectivelly/) for more information.
