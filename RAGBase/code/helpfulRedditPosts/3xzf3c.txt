LPT: If you attach a strong flashlight to a full waterbottle you can create a 360Â° light source.

I posted this on mildly interesting and someone said it would be good for lpt. Pretty simple, all you need is a full water bottle and a good flashlight. Put the water bottle on top of the flashlight and there you have it! a 360 torch. Its a cool way to find your way through the dark haha and it also makes awesome wave effects on your walls and stuff.  Thanks reddit!
