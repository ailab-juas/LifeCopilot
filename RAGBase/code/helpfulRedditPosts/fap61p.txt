YSK: Don’t hang up on emergency services, tell them you didn’t mean to call

content:
If you accidentally call emergency services, make sure you tell them, otherwise they will most likely send out a police car to your location, and you could be fined. Instead, just tell them, “Sorry i didn’t mean to call” and make sure they know it was a mistake.
