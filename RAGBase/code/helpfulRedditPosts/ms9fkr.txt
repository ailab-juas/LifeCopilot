YSK: As the driver of a motor vehicle, you are not being “nice” or “helpful” when you disregard conventional traffic flow to let someone go, you are creating traffic at best and causing accidents at worst.

Why YSK: Because conventional traffic rules and “best-practices” are there for a reason. They reduce congestion on the road and more importantly they allow, to some degree, predictability of other drivers.

What triggered me to post this today?
It’s snowing/rainy today where I live. I was on my way to pick up some lunch, and the genius in front of me decided to come to a dead stop (from the road’s speed limit) in the middle of an intersection while we had a green light, to let the guy waiting on the other side of the intersection take his left hand turn. WTF? I almost rear-ended the guy.

Don’t be that guy/girl. It’s only a matter of time before you cause an accident.

Of course, sometimes it can be nice to stop if traffic is already slow and you are letting someone get in. I am obviously talking about the egregious scenarios like above.

TL;DR
Don’t stop traffic when you have right of way to let someone take their turn 30 seconds earlier. You are doing more harm than good.
