YSK: Google's translation app allows you to download the desired language beforehand to use offline therefore not having to rely on wifi.

Google's free app "translate" allows you to download the language beforehand on wifi by pressing that download arrow beside the desired language in the app. 

I've done this for Korean and Japanese while in Asia, and it works fast and flawlessly. 

While offline, you can also:
* use the app to scan a label/menu/item and it will translate it on the camera in real time 
*translate conversations by the microphone 
*write on the app's drawing pad for translation I.e. Asking a Korean local to write in hangul on the pad for directions to be translated in English
