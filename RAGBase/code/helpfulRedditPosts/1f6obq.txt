LPT: Rather than pay $7 for Windex, easily make your own glass cleaner for 60 cents.

content:
Most of what we're paying for with Windex is WATER. Here is how to make the concoction:

1 empty Windex spray bottle
1/8 Cup (1oz) White Ammonia
1/4 Cup (4oz) Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol
1 Drop Laundry Detergent
Water (Distilled is best) - To till 

64 oz bottle of Ammonia and a 16 oz bottle of Rubbing Alcohol are a $1.00 each at the Dollar Store. Wait till you see how cheap it is to "fake" your own Windex.
