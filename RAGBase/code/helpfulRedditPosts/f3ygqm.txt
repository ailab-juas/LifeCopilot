LPT: Don't buy lilies if you have a cat

content:
My significant other gave me some flowers for Valentine's Day. Turns out there were lilies in the bouqet and my cat ate some of the leaves. We had to rush my cat to the emergency vet, where he will be hooked up to an IV for 3 days. It's unknown if he will survive and the vet told me that it's very serious. On the offchance that he does survive, there will likely be permanent kidney damage. My cat has been by my side since I was a kid and I can't imagine losing my little buddy.

Since today is Valentine's Day, and Easter is coming up soon... Please be aware that **LILIES ARE POISONOUS TO CATS**. Even just breathing in the pollen can result in death.

"The entire lily plant is toxic: the stem, leaves, flowers, pollen, and even the water in a vase. Eating just a small amount of a leaf or flower petal, licking a few pollen grains off its fur while grooming, or drinking the water from the vase can cause your cat to develop fatal kidney failure in less than 3 days. The toxin, which only affects cats, has not been identified. Dogs that eat lilies may have minor stomach upset but they donâ€™t develop kidney failure."

**Here are the most toxic variety of lilies:**
- Asiatic lily (including hybrids)
- Daylily
- Easter lily
- Japanese Show lily
- Oriental lily
- Rubrum lily
- Stargazer lily
- Wood lily

Thank you for all of the kind wishes! I don't usually bring plants into the house, but these were a surprise gift and I was distracted by the holiday. Be safe everyone :(

**Update:** Max's chance of survival is looking pretty good, but he may need a few more days of treatment. He's been given charcoal and fluids, his kidney values are not normal but they're not alarming at the moment. I am overwhelmed by the amount of supportive comments and I'm so glad my post was able to help some kitties.

**Update #2:** Thank you so much to those who have donated, I'm crying happy tears of relief. We reached our fundraising goal and now we can afford to give Max the additional treatment he needs. I'm a broke college kid and your kindness means everything to me. I'll post another update with photos as soon as I can. Fingers crossed for a full recovery! I love you, internet strangers.
