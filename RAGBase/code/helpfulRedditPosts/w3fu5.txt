How to get a telemarketer to hang up on *you* and never call back

content:
Telemarketers driving you crazy?  In the now extremely rare case I see an unrecognized number on caller ID I pick up the phone and say something like "Amalgamated Business Solutions; how may I direct your call?".

It's important to have a fairly long name as their software picks up on this; 'hello' is obviously a live person.

Almost without fail all I hear is a click as they hang up and cross me off their list as being a business number.  In the rare instance they persist and ask for me I just say "this is a business line and that person doesn't work here." at which point they usually * apologize* and never call again!
