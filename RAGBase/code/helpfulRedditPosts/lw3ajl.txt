YSK: If you know that someone doesn't celebrate a holiday(s) and has asked not to be given gifts or partake, it's disrespectful to keep pushing and continue getting them gifts.

content:
Why YSK: There are many reasons someone may choose to not participate in a specific celebration (religious reasons, conscientious, personal choice, etc). That is a decision they have made and asked you to respect. You may have good intentions and don't want them to feel left out, but it's that person's choice. Please respect their decision and don't be offended if they decline to partake or accept your gift. 

Before it comes up, everyone should respect the decisions others have made for themselves and not try to force their lives on them.
