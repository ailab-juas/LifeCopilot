LPT - sort out all automated emails by adding a filter to your inbox using the word “unsubscribe.” Have them sent to a folder of your choosing and watch your inbox clear up quickly. Also try phrases like “opt out” or “donotreply” to continue eliminating volume.

Not my idea but wow it’s been helpful. I recommend putting them all marked as “read” and into a single folder, which you then still check periodically. I’m sure there are better ways too, this is just what has helped me keep my inbox meaningful.

Edit: tons of great advice that filtering out “donotreply” could hide important emails for debt service or other important information, so please be careful there.
