LPT: Don’t under estimate walks. Walks are one of the most effective tools we have at our disposal.

content:
1) Get your blood moving, oxygenated, and chemicals going. 

2) Calms you down if you’re hyped, wakes you up if you’re tired. 

3) Free. 

4) Offers outside perspective of the situation you were just in. 

5) Healthy. 

Just like any tool you have to use it for the right purposes in order to utilize it; under the right circumstances:

1) During an argument. Stop, say “i’m going on a walk” and do so. You accomplish so much in this one situation you stop the argument, give both parties time to cool off and some post perspective. Allow for decision making with better cognizance and  no one can argue with “i’m taking a walk.” Even better is “can we take a walk?” 

2) When you are nervous about something or experiencing anxiety a walk helps with the overall production of your chemicals. You’ll almost always feel better just from the aerobics and blood movement alone but if you add some nature or a stop at a favorite coffee shop to treat yourself you’ll often feel better than you did. 

3) When you need to talk to someone. Taking someone for a walk; asking them on a walk I suppose, says so much. It means you care about them and something may be on your mind. It shows you are willing to be with that person and work through something and that you want to talk and listen. All of the physical benefits will kick in for both parties, and the walk offers and excellent common-goal substrate upon which to build effective communication between two people. 

Walks are amazing use them and reap the benefits. (bring water)
