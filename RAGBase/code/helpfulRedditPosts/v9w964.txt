LPT Talk to Disabled People the same way you speak to anyone else

This is more of a rant than a Pro Tip but it's astounding the amount of people who don't do this 

I work with a woman who is in a wheelchair because of her Cerebral Palsy, plus some cognitive issues. She is mostly non verbal but can communicate through sign language and an app on her iPad. She can perfectly understand what you are saying to her and communicate perfectly.

The amount of people who try to speak to her in a Baby voice or speak loudly at her is laughable, asking things like "oh hi there! Are you having a super day? Good for you!"

I advocate for her when she doesnt do it herself but its tiring to constantly tell people "please don't speak to her like a child" 

It's patronizing and degrading. After they walk away we laugh about it, she signs some crass things which gives me a giggle. 

So just speak normally, or we'll laugh at you when you walk away

Edit: People making the deaf jokes, knock it off? You're not funny and you're proving my point. 
Many deaf people can communicate extremely well, sometimes you don't even realize they are deaf. Many can read lips and carry on a normal conversation
