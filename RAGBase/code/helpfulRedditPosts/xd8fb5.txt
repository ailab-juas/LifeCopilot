YSK: It is safe for kids, and adults, to eat apple seeds.

Why YSK: It's safe from the time you're a toddler to an adult. Apple seeds do contain trace amounts cyanide, but the seeds need to be crushed for it to be released. Even then, the amount is so trace an adult would need to eat hundreds of crushed seeds to begin feeling ill. I bet most people will likely feel full from eating seeds before feeling ill from poison. The seeds don't taste good so I doubt you'll be craving hundreds them. 

If you don't chew the seeds, they can pass through your digestive system fully intact, and will be pooped out safely to help spread the apple population. I guess that's why they're oval shaped and smooth

This all came up because my wife and I were arguing if our teething daughter was OK eating the entire apple; like nothing was ever left behind. She still eats apples that way years later, and I felt like most people don't know this.
