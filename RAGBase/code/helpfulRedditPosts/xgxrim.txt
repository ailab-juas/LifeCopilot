LPT: If you’re cold, tuck your shirt in your pants

content:
When it’s cold, tuck in your shirt! Even if your wearing a sweater and or a coat over it, tucking your shirt in underneath it can be the difference between suffering and managing or managing and comfortable. 

It traps the warmth in, instead of losing it all. 

This discovery was really a game changer for me.

Edit:
Yes, it’s quite intuitive of you’re just wearing the shirt, but under a vest, sweater or jacket people often forget this is an option
