LPT: To meet people for dating and/or friendship, volunteer!

content:
When I was single I tried many dating sites and a few of the mobile apps, and it was overall a pretty disappointing experience (especially for a guy who is hovering well below 6ft tall.)  

However, doing a variety of volunteering activities opened up amazing new avenues for meeting people and getting the hell out of the house.  It doesn't always have to be some crazy good cause (animal shelter, local food bank, litter pickup, etc.) There are plenty of organizations that will gladly accept your assistance (political campaigns, community theatres, libraries, museums, etc.)  

Get out of the house, and if you don't meet anyone right away, at least you actually did something that made a difference in the world and maybe learned something new.  And doing stuff and knowing stuff are attractive traits for anyone.  

Good luck! :)
