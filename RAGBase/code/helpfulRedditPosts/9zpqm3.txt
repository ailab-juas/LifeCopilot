Turning off the porch lights help set the mood and if you have kids, remind them that the ISS is roughly the size of a football field and moving at around 17,500 mph or 28163.52 kph which is almost 8x the speed of a bullet. It is currently the most expensive thing ever built by science-minded, cooperating humans/nations.
