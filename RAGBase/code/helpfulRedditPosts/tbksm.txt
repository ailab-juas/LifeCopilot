LPT:  When going to Disneyland with your children snap a picture before leaving home

content:
When going to any crowded public place with small children, take a picture of your kids with your mobile phone camera right before you step out of your home.  In case you get separated from them you not only know what they are wearing but also have a picture of them in those clothes to show to other people and authorities.
