YSK about "Predatory Towing" and your tools to challenge it in the event you're parked legally.

While many tow companies are reputable and helpful many there's always those few per the hundred that only want to make life harder. YSK what it takes to make your case and avoid being scammed up to 1000s of dollars in fees and charges in the event you're **ILLEGALLY** towed.

Last night, I made a visit to a local neighborhood park; open to the public and still open as the park sign read as Rule #1- "Park open daily until 11:00PM". There's even a closing guard chain to remind folks that the park is in fact closed.

At around 6:12pm yesterday, I stopped at the park to take a walk. Being the winter, it was dark and the park was only partially lit but still open nonetheless.

I parked in a regular spot. Not handicap or any way restricted.About ~30 minutes  into my park visit, I was the only vehicle in the lot. When I arrived, there were 3.

A hazard light lit flat bed tow truck approached my vehicle about 40 yards ahead of me. He took the time to shine his light on my VIN tag; the first steps to claiming a vehicle.

I hollered and startled him; asking him why he's bothering my property. He clearly didn't see me until I made some noise.

I asked him what he was doing and why my vehicle was being blocked by his truck. He literally just said "Sorry." and scurried off. No explanation or dialogue as to why he was scoping my vehicle (which is a little older, '98). I tried to get the name of the driver and tow company to file a formal complaint but he was gone THAT quick.

Relieved, I stepped back and asked myself if I was in the wrong in anyway. I was not--the park was open (a lot of people were walking their dogs), I parked in an acceptable space (not blocking or impeding business in anyway). My vehicle didn't have visible damage or a flat tire--indication of abandonment, there were no posted signs of any sort, NOTHING.

This led me to research "unethical towing" which later was identified as "predatory towing".

Below is what I found from a site in 2007 for California. [Consumer Action Protect Yourself](https://www.consumer-action.org/alerts/articles/protecting_yourself_from_predatory_towing). It may be out-of-state and a little dated but take the time to look up your rights in your area/jurisdiction. Be in the know before they tow.



*1. **One-Hour Rule** A vehicle must be parked for one full hour before being towed unless it is parked in a manner that interferes with an entrance or exit, is within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, or in a fire lane. The curb of a fire lane must be painted red and be clearly labeled “No Parking Fire Lane.”

2. **Unconditional Release** If a vehicle owner encounters a tower removing his or her vehicle but the truck is not yet on a public road, the owner may demand the immediate and unconditional release of the vehicle. The law does not require the owner to provide a driver’s license.

3. **Reasonable Release Fee** If the tower releases a vehicle that has been illegally parked, the tower is entitled to no more than one-half his normal towing fee. Local law enforcement can tell you what the normal towing fee is for your area.

4. **Ten-Mile Limit** A tower cannot take your vehicle to a storage lot that is more than ten miles from where it was parked.

5. **Clearly Posted Warning** A tower must have written consent from the property owner or his agent, who must have waited one hour before calling for the tow. Also, a sign not less than 17 inches by 22 inches in size should be displayed in plain view at all entrances to the property.

It should prohibit public parking and indicate that vehicles will be removed at the owner’s expense, and post the telephone number of the local traffic law enforcement agency and the name and telephone number of each towing company that is a party to a written general towing authorization agreement with the property owner.

6. **Valid Towing Permit** (photos, records, no kick-backs) The tower must have a valid motor carrier permit, shall make records and photographs of each tow available for law enforcement, and shall not share profits from towing with property owners who call for a vehicle removal.

7. **Credit Cards OK** The tower must accept credit cards in payment for towing and storage fees, which must be reasonable.

8. **Compliance Within 24 Hours = One Day Maximum Storage Charge** If the appropriate fees are paid within the initial 24 hours of storage and the storage facility fails to comply or is not open during normal business hours, then only one day’s storage fee may be charged.

9. **Reasonable Gate Fee** The gate fee, or maximum hourly charge for releasing a vehicle after normal business hours, shall be one half the hourly tow rate charged for initially towing the vehicle, or less.

10. **Penalty for Excessive Charges** A person who charges a vehicle owner a towing service or storage charge at an excessive rate is liable to the vehicle owner for four times the amount charged.*
