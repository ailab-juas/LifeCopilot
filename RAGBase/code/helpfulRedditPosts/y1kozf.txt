YSK: if you raise the height of your vehicle you need to adjust the angle your headlights down.

content:
Why YSK: a lot of raised vehicles do not adjust their headlight position. The height adjustment ends up shining into other driversâ€™ eyes at an angle similar to high-beams, which is dangerous (and/or sucks to be on the receiving end). 

The reason high-beams are called high beams is because they are angled to illuminate the road about twice as far as low-beams. When a vehicle is raised, low-beams can turn into high-beams.
