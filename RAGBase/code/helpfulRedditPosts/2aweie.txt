LPT: Quitting a habit

content:
I recently stumbled across [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mauricio-estrella/how-a-password-changed-my-life_b_5567161.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063) article and it's really impacted me. For 20+ years I have been a serious nailbiter. Like any other habit (ex. smoking, drinking, gambling), I've tried all the ways to stop.

In a quick summary of the article, the author recommends to change your password to something that will remind you at all points of the day to stop your habit. For me, mine is Quit@Biting4ever (not the password to this account ;) ). I enter this password for work, school, my computer, everything.

Two weeks I've gone with this constantly on my mind and I'm really seeing improvements. 20+ years of damage doesn't heal right away but I'm really excited to see how well its been going. I haven't seen this article posted to Reddit yet so I thought I would share it with you guys and hopefully improve certain aspects of your lives!

**EDIT**: A lot of comments are about password security. I will stress that this is **certainly not** a good tip for bank password and such. This is more about something you enter a password for everyday, such as a computer login that doesn't contain highly sensitive information for work or something. As someone who is in this situation, yes I find this secure enough for the things I use it on.

**EDIT 2**: There is some negativity about that fact that I've compared nailbiting to things like smoking and drinking. Maybe nailbiting doesn't share the same long term effects as things like those, but it doesn't mean I want to stop biting any less than an alcoholic wants to stop drinking. It became a serious problem for me when I started attacking the nail bed and skin around my nails. To constantly have open cuts really sucks and you would think it would be enough to make me stop, but I just kept going.

**EDIT 3**: To my fellow nailbiters, [/u/fyrilin](http://www.reddit.com/user/fyrilin) pointed out [/r/calmhands](http://www.reddit.com/r/calmhands), a cool subreddit to check out. Seeing other people's progress is pretty cool and may inspire you to finally quit your habit! Last edit I swear :O
