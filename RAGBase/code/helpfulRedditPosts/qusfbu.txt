YSK: People in MLMs are instructed to make their FB feed look like they are making a lot of money and living the good life. They almost never are.

Why YSK: It is a common tactic to get more people into the pyramid scheme.

MLMs are a way to roleplay or LARP as a successful "business owner"- not a path to actual success. They are predatory and a vast majority of people in them either lose money or make far less money than they would have with a minimum wage job.

This is almost always true. Do not fall for the fake image people in MLMs portray on their FB feed. It is all an orchestrated show with the end goal of making you a victim.
