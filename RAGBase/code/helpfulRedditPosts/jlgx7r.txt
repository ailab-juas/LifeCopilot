LPT: If your kid does a chore of any kind without being asked to, and this isn't common, do NOT make a big deal out of it. The best you can do is sincerely thank them.

If you have a kid who only does chores when told to, when they decide to do one on their own, the worst thing you can do is make a big deal out of it, per example say: Look who decided to do something; or I didn't have to ask you to do that? WoW.

This will largely discourage them to do it again, the best thing you can do is just thank them for doing it. 

There are several reasons for this; It is way easier to do a chore if you're not told to do so, as you don't have the pressure to do it, you just decide to. Thanking your child will make them feel way more accomplished for doing the chore.

In fact in general the tasks and chores you do tell them to do ALWAYS thank them afterwards.

Edit: I am sorry if i didn't make it clear but some people were disagreeing with so I'll make it more clear as in what i ment.

If you have a small child say 3 or 4 and they do an unprecedented not requested chore, you should make a big deal expressing excitement. But this post was ment for teens and I'm sorry for not explaining it. And i stand by my statement, a big deal in a mocking form should not be made in any way. Thank them for doing it as if its the norm. I disagree with the offering of gifts every time they do it, as it will make them used to it. And it should be normal to do unsolicited chores.
