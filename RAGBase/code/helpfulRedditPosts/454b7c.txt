YSK That insurance companies can demand your session records from your therapist.

content:
Just happened to a friend which is what brought it to my attention.  Her insurance demanded notes from her sessions, which obviously made both her and her therapist very uncomfortable.  The therapist rewrote them as a summary so the word for word versions wouldn't be handed over, but they didn't accept those. 

I don't know how widespread this practice is from state to state, company to company, but in Philadelphia under AETNA, it's legal and necessary under the terms of their coverage.  

:(

Edit: Misspelled it's AETNA not ETNA
Edit 2: It's Aetna not AETNA.
