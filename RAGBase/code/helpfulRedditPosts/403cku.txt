YSK the 3-2-1 rule of backing up your stuff

content:
There have been a few posts around Reddit today (and everyday) about people losing their most precious photos/work projects/homework assignments, etc. because their phone was dropped in the toilet, or their [computer was thrown across the room](https://np.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/400roj/friends_dad_threw_his_pc_on_the_floor/), or their [laptop was stolen](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3zxt33/til_in_2011_skrillex_lost_an_entire_unreleased/). These incidents, while tragic, do not have to mean the end of all your data if you follow the simple 3-2-1 rule:

* 3 copies of your important files
* 2 different formats (or places)
* 1 of those being offsite

One copy of your data is never enough. A theft, a hardware failure, or any other tragedy could be the end of all your data. Once it's gone, it's gone.

Onsite backups, like what you get with Time Machine or other services like that are great, and can protect you from a hardware failure. They're especially nice to have because it can take a long time to restore data over the Internet, especially if there's lots of it. But in case of a house fire or thorough burglary, you're going to be out of luck yet again. 

That third (offsite) copy is where you get the final bit of protection. You want that backup to be far from you, so just in case your home gets [hit by a fighter jet](https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1202/1579/4m/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/06/article-2126223-127F0A1C000005DC-304_964x709.jpg) (or just a regular fire). There are lots of services that you can use to pay a minimal monthly fee to backup your data. Here's a short list:

* [Crashplan](https://www.code42.com/crashplan/)
* [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/)
* [Mozy](https://mozy.com/)
* [Carbonite](http://www.carbonite.com/)

I personally use Crashplan, and pay about $4/month for the peace of mind that, should anything happen to my home, and my laptop, and my desktop, I won't lose everything. I started paying when I was working on my dissertation, because there was no way I was going to be the guy who got 150 pages into it and lost it all to some freak accident.

EDIT: Clarify $4/month for Crashplan.
