LPT: Make your own QR codes.

content:
So a lot of people I know have a smart phone with an QR scanner.
About a week ago, a lot of new friends came for the first time to my house. Ofcourse one of the first things they asked was the WiFi code. Only one problem, I have this long code with random numbres and letters. I'm to lazy to write it down or to change it ( a part of me thinks it's safer to keep this random code). So when I have to look up the code i need to go to the basement and rip the modem of the wall to read the back of it. 
Solution: I read online about putting wifi and password in an QR code. I googled for a good site to make it work. I came up with: http://www.qrcode-monkey.com/. works excelent and is free. 
I printed, laminated and hung the code on the wall, friends only need to scan it and press "connect". 
Problem solved.
ps. English is not my first language so please don't hate.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold!
