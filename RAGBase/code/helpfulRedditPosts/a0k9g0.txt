YSK You can re-record a voicemail you're leaving on almost any phone by pressing # at any time

This helps me a lot at work. If you record a voicemail for someone that you messed up, just hit the # button. You'll immediately get the option to send your voicemail, listen to the message you recorded, or re-record it.

It helps a lot when I'm leaving a voicemail for someone important and stumble over my words.
