title:
YSK: if a deer runs across the road in front of you, never swerve. Instead, brake as much as you can safely, and flash your lights if there's enough time.

content:
**Why YSK:** It could save your life and your car. Swerving makes you much more likely to: 

- lose control of the vehicle
- hit another driver
- or even hit the deer (if it would've otherwise made it across the road).

Braking reduces the likelihood of damage to any party involved, even if you *do* hit the deer. 

(Or...you know, it hits you. As deer are wont to do.)

**If it's unsafe (or impossible) to brake enough to avoid the animal altogether**, maybe because another driver's behind you, or maybe because there just isn't time, brake as much as you safely can, then release the brake right before hitting the deer. 

This will buck (heh) the nose of your vehicle upwards, reducing the chance of the deer going through the windshield.

**Never speed up if you're about to hit the deer.** This is never safer. That's a myth. It just increases the chances of losing control of the vehicle, and the likelihood of serious damage in general.

Post inspired by the herbivore who just pulled a surprise horizontal trust fall in front of my Highlander tonight. Even braking, it ended up being the second time I've ever made contact with a deer on the interstate.

First time, I swerved, totaled my car, and that deer went straight to deer heaven.

This time, even the deer seemed alright. And the car wasn't even dented.

Wish I'd known this sooner. üëç

edit: added it to the title, but forgot to elaborate in here originally - deer have no idea what flashing lights mean. If anything, they'll just freeze in the light. Flashing lights isn't to scare them away, it's to warn oncoming drivers about a possible hazard in the road at night. If it's daytime or nobody else's around, that part's n/a.

Also the commenters mentioning "where there's one deer, there's more" are 100% right. Great warning about safely avoiding herd animals.
