LPT: If you do not know what to say to a dying loved one, tell them your favorite memory with them.

content:
I was called while driving and told that my grandfather was going to pass soon and that I should say my final words. I told him I loved him and that he made me a better person. I then told him that my favorite memory was when we played Donkey Kong together while sipping Jack Daniels, his favorite. His arthritis was so bad that he could not play video games anymore so he just watched. He watched me struggle to beat Mine Cart Carnage! for well over an hour. We shared so many laughs and I can still here him say "Oooooh Ohlmost had it!" when replaying the level recently. While I was on the phone with him he was in a semi responsive state according to the family, but they told me he had the biggest smile on his face when I was sharing my memory. Reflecting on that event today, I could not ask for better way to say goodbye.

Edit: Thank you for the awards! My grandpa was the who taught me to love the things you love because they make you happy. I hope everyone will think of my grandpa when they play that level so his memory and goodness can continue to live on
