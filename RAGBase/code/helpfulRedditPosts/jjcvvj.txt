LPT: Buy berries when they are cheapest throw them in the freezer and enjoy them anytime instead of ice cream or other unhealthier options.

Don’t be a sucker and spend $5 bucks on one box of blueberries. 

You should see my freezer. Been doing this for years and years cuz I love smoothies and fruit in general. Also works for Bananas on the verge of being over ripe but bananas are usually hella cheap anyway. 

Also works for avocados which are great for smoothies once frozen. Also if you mix frozen avocado, frozen banana, soy milk and vegan protein powder and Blend That up you have plant based ice cream. Just don’t forget to peal your bananas and avocado(do you peal an avocado?) before freezing haha
