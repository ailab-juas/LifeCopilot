YSK that if you don't have a foreign data plan before traveling, AT&amp;T will charge $19.99 per Mb.

I recently found a surprise charge for $187 on my phone bill while my GF is in Hong Kong and she has only used 9 Mb of data (on a shared 10 Gb plan). Luckily, I was able to sign up for the foreign data plan for $30 and have it backdated so I got the charges removed! The biggest thing that cheeses me off is that there is no *way* that it costs AT&amp;T that much to rent space on a foreign network; it's just blatant gouging, IMHO.
