LPT: To Encourage Kids to Wash Their Hands, Get Them a "Special" Soap

content:
My sister took her girls (ages 6 and 9) to Bath &amp; Body Works and let them each choose a "special" hand soap. They spent some time sniffing each one and chose their favorites. These are \*their\* soaps, and they can use them whenever they want. Not only does this guarantee that they wash their hands after using the toilet, but now they'll just randomly go to the bathroom and wash their hands!
