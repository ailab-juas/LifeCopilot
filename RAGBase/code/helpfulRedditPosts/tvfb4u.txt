Why YSK : Whatever reaction they have assigned to the word "Wrong" will often steer how a message is interrupted. 

If someone is incorrect, mistaken or simply need more information it'll often be taken as attacking their moral character and/or intelligence if you say they're "wrong" which will often work against your message. From an early age we're severely encouraged to not be "wrong" which results in it being a triggering word. This applies whether your talking about them or something/someone else.
