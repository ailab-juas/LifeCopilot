LPT: For young adults. As you enter the workforce, learn very quickly how to distinguish between Close Friends, Friends, Acquaintances, and Colleagues. Do not be afraid to move people in and out of these groups of contacts as you learn more.

Grouping the people I meet and get to know into these four categories, has saved me a tremendous amount of time, energy and, mental health. This is incredibly important for your professional success and well-being as well. The sharing of your soul, time, and energy should be analogous to the importance placed on these groups of people.

I have 2 close friends, and it hasn't changed in 15 years. I have a number of people in the other 3 categories, but no one knows me better apart from my spouse than those 2 people.

Who would you say in your life, knows you the best?
