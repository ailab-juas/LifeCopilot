YSK that silicone earplugs are revolutionary to light sleepers and the sound sensitive.

Why YSK: i feel like silicone earplugs are not well known about and I feel like a lot of people will benefit from them. 

I am an incredibly light sleeper, sound sensitive and because of my autism, have difficulty with new feelings and textures. You can feel foam earplugs like earbuds, and laying on your side feels awful. But silicone earplugs can be split and mushed together to fit you perfectly, and because you can mould it to your ear shape, I fell asleep quite quickly after putting them in meaning you don’t feel it too much, and because you can completely cover your ear canal, it blocks out a fair amount of sound. It’s not a miracle worker but they block out doors opening and closing, creaking floorboards and cars going by outside. 

Can also be worn swimming, and to cope with high levels of sound during the day. Also incredibly affordable, but do not exceed 5 uses with each pair, and clean with antibacterial wipes between each use to ensure no infection. 

Only side effects I’ve noticed is some somewhat heavy earwax in the morning but a baby wipe or cloth sorts it out and it doesn’t come back through the day.
