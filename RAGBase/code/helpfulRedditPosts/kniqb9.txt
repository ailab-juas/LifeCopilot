LPT: Put a dog tag on your child’s irreplaceable stuffed animal “lovey,” so if it gets lost, there’s a greater chance of being reunited.

content:
I come at this from a few places: I frequent /r/helpmefind and see a large amount of postings that say something about a child losing their stuffed animal “best friend” and needing help finding a replacement. I’ve found well-worn stuffed animals at various jobs I’ve held over the years, with no way to get them back to the owners. And my child has a stuffed animal they have slept with every night since birth who feels like part of the family. We took them to the pet store and let them pick out a little cat/dog tag and have the machine engrave the lovey’s name on one side, my phone and my husband’s on the other side - made a fun production out of it. Put it on a tight cord around it’s neck (could have used a cat collar), and have way less worries about losing it forever. As a bonus, the amount of time my child spends with the stuffed animal has caused them to easily memorize our phone numbers! I don’t know why more people don’t do this, honestly, and hope it saves a few tragedies!

(Please note: there’s a tiny chance the dog tags could be choking hazards for smaller children, so be mindful of that)
