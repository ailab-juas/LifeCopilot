YSK that brushing your teeth may cause small tears in your gums, increasing the chances of STD transmission - Donâ€™t brush your teeth before oral sex!

edit: [Do not brush or floss your teeth right before you have oral sex. Flossing and brushing may tear the lining of the mouth, increasing the exposure to any viruses that may be present. If you wish to freshen your breath before kissing, try mouthwash instead](http://www.uhs.uga.edu/sexualhealth/oral_sex.html)

edit2: Woah, this blew up! 
So I just want to clarify: Ofcourse you should always practice safe sex, including getting tested, avoiding having oral sex with someone with STD's, telling your partner about the STD if you do have one (and getting it cured if it can be), etc. And yes, you can also use flavoured condoms and dental dams as well, but does anyone actually use these? In my own experience I've never used them nor had a partner request to use them, and I don't know of anyone who uses them for oral sex either.

This is just a tip I stumbled upon last night; I was not aware of the possible small cuts before yesterday and now I'll know not to brush my teeth beforehand- not because I'm having oral sex with an infected person, but to *further reduce* the risk of transmission. 

Just wanted to share, thought this tip would be a good thing to know for anyone sexually active! 

edit3: spelling, phrasing, added condoms/dental dams
