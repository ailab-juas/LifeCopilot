title:
YSK there is a website where you can watch a group of kittens fight/play/sleep live 24/7, called Keeping Up With the Kattarshians

content:
It is an adorable Icelandic website that has so far featured 3 cat families. They only feature rescued cats and the main focus is to find them a home when they're old enough. Right now they have a cream tabby momma and her 5 kittens.
