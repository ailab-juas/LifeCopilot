LPT: Don't underestimate the importance of rest. It can quite literally save your life, relationship, or job.

And I'm not talking about sleeping (though that is important too). 

Overworking yourself isn't a good thing. I recently had a meltdown because of working too hard. I was working seven days a week for 10+ hours a day.

Everything started slipping. My work quality went down. My wife was unresponsive because I couldn't even manage conversation with her. I had a temper and couldn't stop myself from being a complete dick to pretty much everyone else around me.

I almost lost a close friend because of a disagreement.

All because I wasn't doing enough to make more money. Or so I thought. 

Take at least a day where you aren't thinking about work. Read that book you've been wanting to read. Go to the park with your kids. Take your wife to a movie. Whatever it is just make sure you rest and recharge your batteries.

EDIT: A word. And also a bit of clarification; I do not mean that you should just say fuck everything and drop all responsibilities and become a lazy bum. I DO mean that you should plan a day or two a week to just be you. Play that video game all day and don't feel bad about it. Nap to your heart's content. Or do whatever else you want to just be you and center yourself so you can go back to work focused and ready.

And thanks for the awards strangers!


Edit 2: A platinum? Wow. Thank you kindly. I'm glad this helped people enough to make whoever gave it feel it was worthy. Keep on keeping on Reddit.
