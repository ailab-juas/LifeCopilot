LPT: Children's Hospitals do not need donations of stuffed animals. Try hard plastic toys featuring popular characters, craft supplies, board games, and coloring books.

Stuffed animals are an infection risk and often not allowed if they are not brand new. Even if they are brand new, they are not allowed in our playroom. Other staff seems to find some use for them, but ultimately there are many higher need toys and games. Teen items like adult coloring books, video games, and craft supplies are always appreciated.
