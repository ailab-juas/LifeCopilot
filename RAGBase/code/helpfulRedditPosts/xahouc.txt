Ysk: Essential oils do have an effect on you but are often touted as doing way more than is true and do not replace real medicine

So first off pretty much all the benefits are going to fall under aromatherapy. In general if you are told to apply it to a certain area of your body for any reason other than that spot will help the scent reach your nose (neck chest or wrists mainly), then it is probably lying. Things like icy hot or lotion have topical benefits but essential oils focus on smell. Oils can cause a feeling of temperature difference in which case they can help you topically ([like peppermint)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435909/)

Aromatherapy [is a scientifically supported concept.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520654/) [there are many studies with thousands of combined citations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192342/). Aromatherapy is basically using scents to effect your brain. The nose is the one of the 5 senses that has the most direct access to your brain and certain smells can effect your mood. Lavender has been proven to make you sleepy, [Rose oil helps with anxiety,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5511972/) [orange can help with pain relief](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18534325/), and [many more examples are including in this guide with good sources](https://www.healthline.com/health/essential-oils-find-the-right-one-for-you#Types-of-essential-oils)

That being said, a lot of oils being sold are pseudoscience. There are things ranging from mlm schemes to major companies that are known for not being the most clear about what their product actually does or not using quality ingredients that lead to skin irritation. 

Why Ysk: there are many bad products out there and when shopping around you should look at ingredients and reviews. The main ingredients should be whatever the scent is. Essential oils do not replace modern medicine. They can **assist** with certain issues. Research on what ailments you have and talk to your doctor about whether or not it will help you. It is completely possible a doctor may recomend this. A diffuser filled with lavender may be very beneficial for your sleep for example.

You should also be aware of allergies you may have or be cautious if you have sensitive skin. You do not nescessarily need to put oils directly on your skin. There are things like lava rock beeds that are good for holding the scent but will likely still get it on your skin. Be cautious of this. 

Always do research on what you buy and go to a doctor first and foremost.


ETA: as some comments have pointed out, these oils can also be dangerous for pets. They often are much more sensitive to smells and can get sick or even die from certain oils. Your pet should never drink any oils and if they do contact your vet immediately. If you plan to use a diffuser, [here is a link to a reputable website](https://outwardhound.com/furtropolis/health-wellness/pet-safe-essential-oils-for-a-diffuser) that talks about the dangers as well as specifically what scents are safe and dangerous for dogs and cats. Always talk to your vet if you are ever in doubt. Also keep in mind that this can apply to candles. Many pet stores sell pet safe candles if you want to be cautious
