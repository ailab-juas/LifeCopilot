LPT - After marriage, try to live on only one spouse's income while saving the other spouse's income. You'll save up a great amount of money specified for different purposes, and learn to live on less than you make!

Edit: for clarification, this is only if you can afford to. I should have changed “try” to “if you can afford.” It doesn’t work if you have a minimum wage job. 

If a full paycheck isnt realistic to save, start with 25% of one. Then 40, 50, etc and see how much you can save. It’s not a “we can never ever use this paycheck, only spouse x paycheck, not spouse y.” It’s there in case of emergencies or big purchases, that’s the point of saving it.

Edit 2.0: stop sending me vulgar and rude DMs and cussing me out over this post, I have no idea what you’re trying to accomplish. If it bothers you so much, scroll on past it or discuss it in the post, NOT my DMs
