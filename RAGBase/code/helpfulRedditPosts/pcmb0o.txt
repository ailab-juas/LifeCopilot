LPT: Anytime you are feeling frazzled remember HALT

content:
Ask yourself 

Am I

Hungry
Angry
Lonely 
Tired

All of these feelings will affect our judgement. Taking a brief time to eat, sleep, breathe or call a friend can make all the difference in our day. 

Next time you are feeling crazy remember to

HALT










Edit:

After everything you have been through you are still here. For that I am proud of you. 

Be easy on yourself. Forgive a little more, have self compassion. You’ve always done the best you knew how. 

Look in the mirror and say I love you. I know it’s silly but just give it a try. Really. 

When you start to fill up and love yourself again offer it to someone else. Offer a smile, be an ear to talk to, let someone know that you appreciate them.

This is your life and you are doing good work here. Thank you for all that you do and thank you for taking care of yourself.

I love you
