LPT - if you're planning a surprise trip for someone, the destination should be the surprise, not the trip.

As nice of a gesture as this can be, if someone is not expecting to travel and be away from home, this can be a disappointment and ruin a great trip. Talk it through with the other person before you take it upon yourself to commit a significant amount of their time to something.

Now if only I could go back in time and get my gf to read this... RIP my birthday weekend.
