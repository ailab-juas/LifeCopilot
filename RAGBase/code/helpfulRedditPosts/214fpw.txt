LPT: When smiling for a picture, press your tongue to the roof of your mouth. It creates better definition between your chin and neck.

It's not the most important LPT you'll ever read, but in my experience it's effective for almost everyone.  The difference is subtle but flattering.  No need to over do it.  As you smile for the camera, lightly press your tounge to the roof of you mouth to bring the space between your chin and neck up a bit.  A friend told me this tip years ago.
