LPT: Turn off your roommate’s alarm by calling them

content:
If a phone alarm is ringing your in your house and you want to shut it without getting up from bed, just ring that phone’s number. 

It will stop it immediately. Happy snoozing. 

Use at own risk, I am not responsible for angry roomies or partners if they don’t wake up.




EDIT: holy freak, this blew up. Ok so, some more info here. Like I said I have never once used this LPT to cause stress to someone. It is mostly used by me when my gf who sets 10 alarms, gets up on the second and rushes to the washroom and does not cancel the rest of them. 

She doesn’t take her phone in and it keeps ringing maybe on the kitchen countertop. I obviously don’t want to get up from the bed at 7am in the morning and turn it off so I just ring it using my phone beside me. We both know it and really don’t mind it. 

Also, the snoozing part, I don’t know if it snoozes or cancels (because i am asleep and never bothered to experiment) but its enough time for her to exit the bathroom and take care of it or leave the house. (This is on iphone). 

So do what you will with that information, I just shared an LPT, if it causes stress between your roommates and yourself, probably you have other things to sort out.
