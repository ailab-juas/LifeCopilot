LPT: If you answer a call on speakerphone, literally the first words out of your mouth should be "Hey, you're on speakerphone"

content:
Edit: Yes, your regular earpiece can be louder than you think, and at full volume it can be loud enough for other people to hear even if you think you're having a private conversation. Please keep that in mind

Even if you think you're alone, you might have left a window open, and your walls and doors are probably thinner than you think. It's just a good habit to make.

Edit: Yes, you should probably also mention who is on speakerphone with you, especially at work.

Edit: Also, if you answer someone on speakerphone without telling them and you KNOW there are people around you, you're a colossal tactless fuck and I hope they talk about your most embarrassing secret because you deserve it, since they could just as easily start talking about their own most embarrassing secret.

Edit: It's not just about talking shit on other people in the room! I refer you to the above edit. Someone might call you to tell you their child has cancer, or they might be getting a divorce, and it's not THEIR responsibility to make sure they're NOT on speakerphone to not reveal their personal information that they don't want random people knowing. BE A GOOD FRIEND

Edit: the real LPT is not to use speakerphone unless you're on a conference call and the person calling already knows that. If you need to be hands-free, use bluetooth headphones

Edit: No, I don't have a (recent) story here. I was inspired to make this post after reading a story on AITA: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hjk9qa/aita_boyfriend_is_mad_i_told_him_he_has_covid19/
