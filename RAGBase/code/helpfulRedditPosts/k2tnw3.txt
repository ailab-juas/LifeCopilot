LPT: Married to a service member and afraid to report domestic violence for fear of losing financial benefits for you and your children? The DoD has set up a fund to financially support reporters of abuse.

content:
Iâ€™ve been active duty for 16+ years and as a Company Commander, dealt with multiple incidents of domestic abuse within the ranks (spouse on service member and vice versa). The spouses were always unwilling to testify for fear of losing financial support and benefits for them and the family.
