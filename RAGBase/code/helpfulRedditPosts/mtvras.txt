YSK: the difference between responsive and spontaneous sex drives.

content:
"**Spontaneous**" desire happens when you are mentally interested in sex before you are physically interested in it. So, you feel arousal randomly, with or without stimulation. "**Responsive**" desire happens as a response to stimulation. So, something must happen to trigger sexual arousal. A few studies show \~25% of men and \~85% of woman ~~do not~~ tend to not experience spontaneous desire. (EDIT: Keep in mind others show somewhat different percentages).

(EDIT: As a commenter pointed at, don't use the above as an excuse to unconsensually touch others. Attraction and arousal is a spectrum, it can be triggered by consensual flirting or emotional attraction. DO NOT interpret this as me saying that you need to unconsensually touch others to get them in bed. That is not true and will not work. This post is also primarily focusing on relationships or understanding yourself.)

Why YSK:

1. If your partner tends to feel responsive desire, this may explain why they don't initiate sex as often as you do. This especially plays into gender differences.
2. "Spontaneous" desire is often portrayed as the norm in media. If you're like me, you may have been struggling to understand your own responsive sex drive and make sense of it.
3. Or, you may be struggling to understand why you feel desire randomly and are harsh to yourself about it.

EDIT: Many may be some sort of mix of "responsive" and "spontaneous".  And the lines may blur depending on factors like relationships, partner, stress and pressure, \[as a commenter pointed out\], etc. None of this is an exact science. I'm also not an expect, so I recommend checking out the articles below:
