LPT: Remember specific words, definitions, numbers, etc. by tapping your finger against a hard surface

content:
My Spanish teacher taught me this back in middle school and I've used it ever since for anything I don't want to forget. While you are already having a mental memory of what you remember, you are creating a physical memory too.

It's helped me remember friends numbers, peoples license plates, addresses, words I'm studying, languages, whatever I don't want to forget. 

Edit: Sorry for the confusion. I'll use an example. When I want to remember a phone number, I will tap my index finger onto a hard surface to each number I say in my head or out loud. So I'll say 2 "tap" 5 "tap" 1 "tap" and so on. 

If I'm trying to remember the definition of a word I just learned, I tap my finger to each syllable of each word in the definition.
