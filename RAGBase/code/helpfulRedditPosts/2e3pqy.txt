LPT: Can't get your cat into its carrier? Try sticking them in backwards.

content:
My cat HATES being stuck in that carrier. She fights so much that I've had to get smart with putting her in.

One thing I've learned is that she recognizes the carrier as the "death box of deadly death". If I pull it out before putting her on a leash, she's going to hide from me. So, my first step is to get her on a leash.

Next, get the box and open that cage. Upon seeing this, my cat begins the struggle for her freedom. At this point, I put her down with her rear end facing the entrance of the doom box. Since she is trying to escape my grasp on her, she ends up backing up right into the box (this is more likely to happen if you barricade the other options with your body).

Lock the cage and you're good to go. Unfortunately, I cannot provide any tips to avoid the amount of hatred and distrust your creature will have for you afterwards.
