LPT: You can’t afford something until you can buy it twice

content:
Laptop cost 1500? Don’t buy it until you have 3000.

Vacation cost 2000? Don’t buy until you have 4000.

This way you can always guarantee you have a financial safety net in case something big comes up and demands a large chunk of cash. It’s far worse to have a new thing and be broke, than to have money but no new thing.

EDIT: mortgages don’t count
