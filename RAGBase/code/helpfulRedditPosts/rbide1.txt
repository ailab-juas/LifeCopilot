LPT Remember you're not getting a raise if your employer isn't increasing your pay beyond inflation. Some employers will give you a cost of living increase plus your annual increase others will ignore this entirely. This year inflation is at 6.2% that means you'll break even with a 6.2% raise!

Remember when you get your annual review and they tell you congratulations you're getting a 5-8% raise for all of your hard work they're actually fucking you and smiling like they're doing you a favor. Pay attention to inflation, your salary, your industry pay and your annual increases.
