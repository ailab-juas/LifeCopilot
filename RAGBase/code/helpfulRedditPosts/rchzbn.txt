LPT: Toss a few cinnamon sticks in a pot with an inch or two of water and simmer on Low on the stove - it will make your whole house smell great.

EDIT: To expand on my Note below, let me stress that **if you forget about it and/or leave it unattended, this will have disastrous consequences**. Please use this tip safely and responsibly. A few commenters have mentioned using things like slow cookers, butter warmers, etc. - please use these recommendations if possible. If you leave the stove on, be sure to set a timer on the microwave for an hour *at the very least* to remind you to shut it off.

Note: Always keep an eye on the pot while simmering - don't let all of the water evaporate! You can also toss a lid slightly cracked on the pot to prevent the water from evaporating too quickly.
