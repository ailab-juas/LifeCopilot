LPT: Be care about using 'Do Not Disturb' signs at Hotels, they are both a blessing and a curse

content:
*This sounds like common sense but with the amount of volume my hotel handles, and as many times as this happens, this is clearly NOT common sense.*


I work front desk at a hotel and I can tell you that 75% of the 'issues' I have reported to me originate with 'Do Not Disturb' signs.


**It varies from hotel to hotel,** but these signs are taken quite seriously at some hotels.


**At the property where I work** at you could call for towels to be sent up to the room, but if there is a DND sign on the door we are NOT allowed to knock or disturb you, hotel policy.


Once we have noticed the sign (There is an active list updated every 3-4 hours by walking the floor to see who has them up, and who doesn't.) we **(the staff)** cannot call you unless it an emergency, there is a billing/clerical issue, or you receive a "personal" phone call. 


*(Another quick LPT, if you know someone is going to call you at the hotel make sure they know your last name AND room number, most hotels can't transfer calls unless you they know both.)*


If you are staying at a hotel for more than one night and want Housekeeping to tidy up for you, remember to take down the sign.  **At my particular property** could be walking out the door to go out for the day, see a HK and ask them to make sure your room is freshened up, but if you left your DND sign on the door they cannot go in *(Hotel policy does state however that we have to enter the room once every 3 days to make sure you aren't wrecking the room or ...well to be honest, dead.)*

Thanks for reading.

And yes, I know the title is screwed up, I posted this at work and I got interrupted trying to delete "Be careful about" and replace it with "Take care when", when I got done helping the guest I suppose I didn't remember where I was in the post. :)

Thanks for all the responses and I'm actually enjoying answering all these questions.

Edit: added bold to parts that people seem to be forgetting to calculate into their replies.
Edit: Changed the wording to not make it sound like I am an ambassador that sets all policies for all hotels throughout time and space.
