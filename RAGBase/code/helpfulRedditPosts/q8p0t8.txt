LPT: Don't pretend to know something you don't

content:
Yes, I'm familiar with the adage "fake it to make it." I don't think it's entirely wrong, but I do think it gets misconstrued and applied too broadly to too many situations. 

I have a few people in my life that you can't say anything to, because they already "know" it. Even when it's something they aren't familiar with (and you can easily tell), they have to put on a show of being total old hat about this particular piece of knowledge. Guys, guys. It is so OBVIOUS when you are pretending to know something you don't. And it is dumb. You're not showing the other person you are smart, you're trying to one-up them and dismiss their knowledge to make you feel better about yourself. And it makes you look like an insecure tool. Stop it. It's okay, better even, to not pretend to know everything. Especially in your personal relationships. Trust me, we already know.
