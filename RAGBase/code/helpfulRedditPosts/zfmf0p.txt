LPT: Beach towels are larger than bath towels and come in more colors/designs

content:
Stop settling for boring neutrals that barely cover a third of your body and start wrapping yourself in the giant cartoon towel you deserve

edit: I’m sorry so many of y’all have shit beach towels. Mine was $15 from Target, is absorbent as hell, and looks like a Pop-tart. I am warm after every shower and I’m having fun and that’s what matters to meeee
