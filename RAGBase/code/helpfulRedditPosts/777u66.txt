title:
YSK to yield to funeral processions

content:
While the laws vary from state to state in the U.S., generally speaking, funeral processions should be granted the right of way, regardless of whether you have a green light. If you see a line of cars with headlights on and/or hazards flashing, this is a funeral procession. Sometimes they will even be marked with small flags. Not only is it legally required to grant right of way to funeral processions in some states, it's also just the courteous thing to do. 

I've been seeing a lot of funeral processions getting cut into lately, which has me thinking that maybe this isn't being taught in driver's ed. anymore. Don't be that dick who holds up a funeral. If you see a procession, let it pass, and if you accidentally cut into one, just pull over and let them move in front of you.
