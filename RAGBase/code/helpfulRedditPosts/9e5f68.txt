YSK: Most states liquor licenses don't permit alcohol to be exclusive to members only at places like Costco

content:
Most states will require a members only store such as Costco to sell their liquor to anyone. You just have to go up and say you're only there to buy alcohol. It's a great way to save money on alcohol.

Edit : because I've had multiple people ask which States this applies to, here is a list of States that allow it
Arizona

California

Connecticut

Delaware

Hawaii

Indiana

Massachusetts

Michigan

Minnesota

New York

Texas

Vermont

If your state allows this policy and is not on the list, pm me and I'll add it to the list
