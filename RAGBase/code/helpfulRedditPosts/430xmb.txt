YSK about the Kitty Convict project- dress your indoor cat in an orange collar, and if you spot one outside, it may be an escapee!

Less than 5% of lost cats are returned home. The Kitty Convict project is an initiative to help return lost cats to their homes.  

"If you have an indoor kitty, put an orange collar on them."
