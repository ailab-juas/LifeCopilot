LPT: Keep Kitty Litter on hand, even if you dont have cats.

content:
Kitty litter is one of those wonderful, multi-purpose items that should be in everyone's garage/bathroom/laundry room. Let me tell you why:

Kids get sick at odd hours in odd places. If your lucky enough to have multiple, guess what else gets multiplied too. Kids vomiting in stereo is horrible. Dump some kitty litter on the puddle to neutralize the smell and make for easier (less gag inducing) cleanup. 

This goes for dogs too. A dog stuck inside with diarrhea all day is not something you ever want to come home to, but it happens.  Let the litter soak up the nastiness for easy sweep up into a single trash bag for disposal. 

Oil spill in the driveway? You guessed it. 

Tires stuck in wet, muddy ground? Pour a good amount in front of the drive tires for a little traction. 

Keep a box around the house, it will definitely come in handy!
