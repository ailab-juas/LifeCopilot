LPT: When shopping, dining out, or going to a movie on Christmas, don’t tell the employees you “hate that they make you work on Christmas.” You are the reason people have to work on Christmas.

Edit: Some people like to work on Christmas (or don't mind it). Some people work for critical services like emergency services, public works, and health care. Thank goodness for all of those folks. One of my best friends has to work Christmas Eve, day, and the day after at her hospital (next year, she'll have it off).

My point was: don't pretend you're sympathetic to the people who have to work on Christmas when you are giving that business money on Christmas Day. "Oh, I hate that you have to work on Christmas...can I get a refill?" If you choose to go shopping on Christmas, you DON'T hate that someone is being made to work on Christmas, and it's inconsiderate to say to an employee who knows they're missing out on fun at home.

Whether or not you believe in the religiosity of Christmas, it is a also a significant secular holiday. For many, it is an opportunity to spend time with people they don't see often (and who they enjoy seeing). Telling people they should just quit their jobs if they don't want to work on Christmas is silly. People have the right to be sad they are missing a nice meal with their family.

Merry Christmas! :)
