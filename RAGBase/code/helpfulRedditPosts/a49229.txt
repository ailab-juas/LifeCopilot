LPT: When sitting down while talking to someone, cross your legs. If you need to leave or want to get out of the conversation, uncross them and lean forward slightly. The person you're talking to will likely start to wrap up what they're saying.

This probably works because of the sudden loss of a casual demeanor. The person will see it as a signal that you're about to leave, and will likely end the conversation for you, usually within mere moments.

Edit: I just woke up, and can't believe how much attention it got! I posted this because I used to find goodbyes awkward, but when I started doing this it much got easier. As others have mentioned, leaning forward might indicate interest in the conversation. What I meant to say is that you should stop leaning backward. I guess I phrased it poorly.
