YSK that you can text 741741 to talk to a crisis counselor anonymously through text if you are suicidal, depressed, or feeling really down.

This number is for the US. This has helped me before at those times you dont feel like talking but you need to talk to someone. Seriously if you need to talk to someone there is absolutely no reason to feel bad about it or that you dont deserve someone to listen to you. I know this has been posted a few times before but it hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves. Also if you want me to send you dumb memes to cheer you up I will.

Also if in the Cambridgeshire area there is The Sanctuary. If you call 111 etc in crisis they will pick you up and take you to the centre where there are people to talk to. Amazing people.
