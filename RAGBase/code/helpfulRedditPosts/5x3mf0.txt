YSK that UC Berkeley is removing free lecture videos from Youtube and iTunesU on 15 March 2017.

Official statement from the school: http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/03/01/course-capture/

It's very likely this will happen to other schools, even non-public ones. [This Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13768856) mentions Stanford was forced to remove some of their videos.

Past discussions on r/DataHoarder/: [original](https://np.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/5376y5/berkeley_is_taking_down_their_free_course_videos/) and [an archive effort](https://np.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/5804np/youtube_archiver_and_uc_berkeley/).
