Really good read, and a key element from the conclusion: “Public awareness is one of the most important aspects of implementing a zipper merge. This includes the use of clear signage and public education campaigns. All drivers (including truck drivers) must know how a zipper merge operates and understand that it is utilized to benefit them.”
