LPT: Admitting when you are wrong, directly and succinctly, is not only being a great teammate, but also a great way to determine friend from foe in the workplace.

content:
You screwed something up, and you need to get in front of it. When this happens to you, get right to the point by acknowledging that you directly made the mistake (don’t throw anyone else involved in there), and briefly talk about what that mistake means for the business. This will immediately change the way people think of you as a resource. 

“I didn’t remember to update the thing before Christmas, it was a mistake and I’ll do better next round. This means we need to do this to fix the problem asap.”

Now the life pro tip… 

If someone reacts in a way that focuses on you, attaching your name to the mistake in front of leaders, they are absolutely not interested in elevating your contributions or station. They simply consider you a resource to be used, and not someone who can be molded, taught, or promoted. 

If someone reacts by jumping in, offers you help to fix the issue, and feels the fix isn’t just yours to make, these are the people who will often lead initiatives with incredible outputs. They often have an entire gravitational pull in organizations because they realize failure is inevitable, and that the faster we fail, the faster we fix. These are your gems, always try to align with them in any way possible.
