LPT: On vacation? Don't eat anywhere near tourist spots. The food is rarely authentic and twice as expensive. Walk a few blocks away, usually about where there aren't anymore signs subtitled in English, then eat there.

I used to work at Rockefeller Center in NYC and had to walk away from the tourist trap every day to eat good food at a reasonable price. Took that lesson with me to Rome, Italy. Instead of eating next the tourist spots (Palatine Hill, the Colosseum, Spanish Steps, etc), we'd always walk a few blocks away to where people stopped speaking English. Food was waaay better than the obviously frozen pasta we had our first day, before I realized what we should've been doing. 
 
Edit: As with any LPT, context matters.  In some countries, it's better and safer to stay within the tourist bubble.
