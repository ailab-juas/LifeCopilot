LPT: When working with contractors on a home project, log everything in a diary

content:
Mark down what date you ordered service, phone calls and what was spoken/agreed on, what work happened when, etc. This makes things so much easier to reference down the road, especially if things go poorly. At a glance, you know when you last spoke to someone, when people should be coming out, etc.

I'm remodeling my kitchen and hitting some snags, trying to retroactively collect this info is much harder.




Edit: I'm enjoying the discussion! As a new home owner, I wish I had known more about working with contractors before my first experience. Why don't they teach us this in school?


Some of the additional tips added in the thread: 

-Work through email as much as possible, or text. Send follow up emails or texts after phone calls listing what was discussed/agreed on. Some apps allow for recording of phone calls or texting from your computer which also logs all texts. 

-Put a "done date" on contracts/agreements and dock pay if work goes far beyond it 

-Don't pay in full until work is complete. Some places allow you to keep a retainer for a few months to ensure no issues come up. 

-Make sure they're properly insured 

-Take pictures before, during, and after work 

-Record in a journal if the term diary offends you ;) 

-If working on a project with another person like an SO spouse, create a google docs diary/journal. You can both update it as you receive info and calls, and have everything in one place
