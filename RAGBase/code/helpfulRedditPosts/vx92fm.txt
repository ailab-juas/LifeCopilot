YSK about 988, the new suicide hotline number you can call, text or web chat

The USA’s hotline’s number as of Saturday will now be a simple three digit code, 988, with the option to text or web chat in addition to voice calls. The original number will work as well 

The line is staffed 24/7 365 days a year with trained counselors. 

Why YSK: Knowing the short hand code will allow people to reach out more easily. Also, the text function may lead many more who are uncomfortable speaking to reach out. 

This is a great initiative and I hope everyone can spread the word

Edit: The hotline will only send someone if you’re an active danger to yourself or others (you have a plan, access to means, are prepared to carry it out) You don’t have to be in active crisis to call. You can call and chat about anything that’s bothering you. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help. There’s always hope ❤️
