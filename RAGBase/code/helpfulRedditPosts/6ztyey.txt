LPT: Don't know which side your bread-plate or wine glasses are on when fine dining? Touch your thumb and index finger together - "b" for bread on your left hand and "d" for drinks on your right hand.

I quite frequently give this tip out to those who are not used to fine dining. A really handy tip that I stick to myself - no more stealing someone else wine! 

EDIT: A quick clarification for those who have trapped various parts of their bodies in various objects...

Imagine you're making the internationally-recognised "okay" diving hand signal, with your thumb and index finger (on the same hand) touching and the remaining fingers outstretched. 

Granted, this advice doesn't work in casual dining settings. Many restaurants bring out cutlery just before the next course, and it is rare to see a fully laid table. The advice is, however, incredibly useful for large banqueting events (e.g. weddings and dinners).
