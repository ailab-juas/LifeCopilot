LPT: When you travel, bring something that smells good but that you’ve never used before — like a new perfume or a scented candle. You can condition yourself to associate a certain smell with your vacation, and you’ll be able to viscerally remember your travels years later by smelling that scent.

Photos are great, but nothing beats being able to close your eyes and feel like you’re really there again. I personally recommend a body scent like perfume or cologne (or even a new deodorant) over an object like a scented candle so that you can take the scent with you wherever you go in your travels, rather than only being able to smell it in your hotel room.
