If Maxis thought it was good music for building and running a city from the ground up, then it ought to help you with your Pre-Calculus class. It certainly helped me stay focused throughout high school and college when I needed to put the pedal to the metal.

EDIT: also, I'm aware of (and have used) other options (e.g., Brian Eno, Classical music, or a specific Pandora Station), however what makes the S3K soundtrack ideal is its variety ([the composer, Jerry Martin](http://www.jerrymartinmusic.com/), uses electronic, jazz, and ambient influences in his compositions). 

Additionally, the sentimental value (if you grew up with the game) doesn't hurt either.
