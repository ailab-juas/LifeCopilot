LPT: Make you ringtone's and notification's sounds like coughing or a whistle.

content:
 As a college student and waiter who forgets to silence his phone, this has saved me from death glares from professors and customers when my phone goes off. Works great for movie theaters and office meetings. While yes, people will notice the sound, they will not necessarily know what it was or where it came from. I know there is the damn mosquito ringtone that "old people" can't hear, but I'd soon rather have my ringtone be a fire alarm than use that.

If anyone has other good ringtone ideas, I will try to edit the post and this them up here to prevent excessive LPT posts. 

Possible other noises:

* Sneezing
* Gunshot (of course be careful with this one)
* Fart
* Pssst
* Quarter dropping
* Opening a pencil case
* Clearing your throat
* Opening a soda can
