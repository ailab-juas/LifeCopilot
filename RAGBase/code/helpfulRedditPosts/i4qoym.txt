LPT: Use disagreements in relationships to grow closer

content:
Disagreements/arguments are crucial to a healthy relationship with your spouse, friend or family. 

In modern times, people see arguments as being toxic in a relationship and jump ship. Work through disagreements as a team. 

The key is in how you handle the arguments. Watch what you say in the heat of the moment as you can’t take back words you said out of emotion. 

When in a disagreement/argument, slow down, understand each other’s point of views. Throw your ego out the window. This is where you’ll grow closer because you’ll learn new things about the other person.
