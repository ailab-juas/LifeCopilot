LPT: Use shims to tilt your refrigerator back slightly so the doors naturally close.

content:
I heard this trick years ago from an appliance repair tech. Since then I've always kept thin pieces of wood under the front feet of my fridge. This angles the refrigerator back ever so slightly and now gravity tries to shut the doors.  An old paint paddle works great for this and they're free at most home improvement stores.

Edit: Thanks for the awards. I'm just trying to keep the ice cream solid.
