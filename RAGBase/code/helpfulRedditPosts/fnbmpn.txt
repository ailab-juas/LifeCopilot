LPT: If you’re now a student learning from home, establish boundaries sooner than later.

content:
Students everywhere are being told to move out of the dorms and go back home for the rest of the semester due to the virus. After talking with lots of friends, the common denominator in our conversations was always that people are feeling very suffocated living with their parents again for the same reason: **boundaries** . 

Wether you’re in grade school or college this probably applies to you. It can be hard transitioning into living with family members that you have to answer to again after being on your own for a while and developing your own living habits as an adult. 

So here is the tip: Make a list of things you need from your new long term yet temporary living space, and ask your parents to make a similar list of what they expect from you. This is where you will be learning for the rest of the semester potentially, so ask yourself questions like:


- Do you need quiet hours for studying? If so, when?
- Do you need a list of chores to do, or a way of communicating that you’re contributing around the house? 
- Do you need alone time? 
- Do you need a proper work space?

Have a gentle conversation with your parents about these things BEFORE there is a fallout. Personally I was having a problem with my mom asking me to do chores when I just sat down to begin my work, and it would throw me off for the whole day, especially considering everyone is stuck at home during quarantine.

**EDIT** : damn, so many of y’all are saying stuff along the lines of family’s like this don’t exist. I’m sorry if you come from a family where you can’t have conversations like this, it’s worth a try though dude.  I had to have had this convo with my parents last night and they were understanding. Of course there were some things we didn’t agree on but the end result of a compromise is really the goal, we both needed to **communicate.** I don’t mind doing chores or anything to help the house, in fact I’m even cleaner than my family. 

I mentioned the main problem I had was being asked to do chores when I just sat down to start my work, which is true but I wasn’t talking about stuff like taking out the trash, **I meant like my mom asking me to pressure wash the fucking driveway all afternoon and assuming I have time for that. While this is a vacation for some people, for most students our lives just got flipped upside down and I wasn’t going to let this interruption continue when I still have classes to pass.**
