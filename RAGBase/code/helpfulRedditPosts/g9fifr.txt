LPT: If you started college at a 2 year school, then transfer to a 4 year school and dropped out without a degree, contact the 2 year school about Reverse Transfer Programs, you may have already earned an Associates Degree that you are not getting credit for.

content:
A 2 year degree can significantly improve your employment prospects (vs just a high school dipoma).  If you dropped out after transferring (or you are thinking about dropping out because of economic uncertainty), then you may already qualify for an Associates Degree, or you may qualify with only one or two more courses.

Reaching out to the registrars office of the 2 year school you attended is a great place to start for information, but a group of colleges have teamed up with the National Student Clearinghouse at ReverseTransfer.org (https://reversetransfer.org/) to simplify the process.

Keep in mind that if your school is not listed, it does not mean you can't qualify, it just means you will have to contact your college directly to find out your status.
