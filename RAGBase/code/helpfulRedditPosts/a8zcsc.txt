LPT: When being treated to a personal meal at a restaurant, try to stay within their budget. You can figure this out discreetly by asking what your friend/family/colleague is getting, then ordering around or under that price - not more than a dollar or two more than theirs.

content:
Whatever the case, a burger, sandwich or wrap is often a safe choice price-wise. 

EDIT: The point is that you don't come off as a greedy snob taking advantage of someone else's graciousness. Like, staying a few dollars within their scope, as opposed to ordering an extra appetizer and the largest steak on the menu when everyone else has burgers. You WILL come off badly in a lot of social situations if you go too high above their grade. 

And for those coming in on their high horses about this, congrats if you're willing to pay for anything - make that clear somehow when/before you sit down so the other person doesn't feel guilty about your budget.
