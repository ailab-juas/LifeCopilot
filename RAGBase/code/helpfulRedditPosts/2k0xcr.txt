YSK George Romero's 1961 masterpiece 'Night of the Living Dead' is in the public domain and thus can be viewed/downloaded freely.

Just Google it. 

If you've seen it, and didn't know about this, I probably don't have to sell it to you. If you haven't seen it, well, it's a classic- and the first true iconographic, maybe the most important, zombie movie. It's also one of the best and most important horror movies ever generally-speaking. 

Terrific viewing for this time of season. Completely free. 

*1968. Not 1961. Don't know why I wrote 1961.
