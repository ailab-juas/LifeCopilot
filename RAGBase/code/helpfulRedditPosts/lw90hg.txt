YSK: The microwave isn’t ruining your food, you probably just don’t know how to use it properly.

Why YSK: If you’re wondering why your food is always coming out of the microwave rubbery, tough, and otherwise gross, it’s probably because you reheated your food improperly.

The “time cook” and “power level” settings are your best friend. If reheating something that you don’t want to ruin (like a steak, maybe some seafood, etc.) try microwaving for double the time at half the power (50% or power level 5). You can even do lower setting for longer periods of time if you’re being careful. Your food will be much less “microwaved” when it comes out.

If you’re just trying to get something hot really fast (like a cup of coffee), just use the normal setting.

TLDR: Learn to use your power setting on your microwave. This is truly divine knowledge.
