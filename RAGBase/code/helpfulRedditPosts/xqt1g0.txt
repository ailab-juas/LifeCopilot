LPT: Be careful buying a used car (in the U.S.) in the coming months

content:

I posted this after Hurricane Ida, remains true now. After a massive hurricane like Ian, thousands of cars will have flood damage and be totaled. A lot of those cars will be transported far away and auctioned off to dealers and not have their titles transferred to a “salvage” title. If you’re in the market, make sure to inspect the car you’re looking at very closely for water damage, or hire a professional to do it for you.
