LPT: You can decrease anxiety in minutes with this breathing trick and this vision trick

What's better than one efficient and simple anxiety-reduction trick? TWO efficient and simple anxiety-reduction tricks.

*All credit for this goes to Andrew Huberman and the incredible field of neurobiology.*

**Breathing trick:** Inhale twice, then let it go in one exhale.  This is called a physiological sigh (double inhale, single exhale), and it sends a message to the brain that it's time to calm down.

**Vision trick:** Soften your gaze by trying to take in things in your peripherals.  At the sides and in the distance.  This is called panoramic vision, and also sends a message to the brain that it's time to calm down.

Bonus tip (that you probably already know): Try to keep your shoulders relaxed and your jaw unclenched.
