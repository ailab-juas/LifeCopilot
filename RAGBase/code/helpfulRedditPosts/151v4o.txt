LPT: Are you experiencing fatigue for seemingly no reason at all? Get your eyes checked!

Somewhat unconventional, probably useless for most, but hear me out, it's just some friendly advice.


I've been struggling with constant fatigue (pretty much every day) for the past few years and I decided that it has to do with my lifestyle, so I made some changes - I've changed my diet (now paleo), started working out every other day of the week (cycling, swimming, cardio) but nothing seemed to help in a significant way.

Fast forward to around 2 months ago, I've had my routine check-up, including an eye exam. I've been told that I have astigmatism, and that I'll have to wear glasses to correct my vision.

Ever since I received the glasses (and actually started wearing them :) ), the fatigue subsided. Fast forward to now (around a month and a half since I got my glasses), and my life has almost turned around 180 degrees - I feel as if I'm reborn. No more headaches, no more fatigue ever since I wake up, no more oversleeping, I even stopped drinking coffee/yerba mate. Life's good :)!

I bet you're thinking "My vision isn't THAT bad" - Hell, mine isn't bad either, I'm only at -0.5 and -1, it's mostly the astigmatism that screws me up.

**tl;dr** If you're feeling tired very often, get your eyes checked. Your bad eyesight might be the culprit!


EDIT: To those dismissing my tip.. it's just friendly advice. I realise that many people adapt to their eyesight issues and may never realise that it could be the problem - I'm just throwing the idea out there for them. Never did I say that it's solution for every person suffering from fatigue.
