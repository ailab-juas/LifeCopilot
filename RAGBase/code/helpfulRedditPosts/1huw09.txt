LPT: Travel - lost luggage? Buy new stuff and file a claim.

content:
You land at the airport, go to the luggage carousel and... nothing. The luggage office says "Your cases were misrouted; they'll be here tomorrow" and they send you on your way with a bit of paper. 

The LPT: Buy what you need when you need it. Keep receipts. Don't hold off because "it'll be here tomorrow"

Buy toothbrush, toothpaste, razors, shampoo, etc as soon as you leave the airport. If stores are open, buy shorts, t-shirt, underwear, whatever you need for at least the next day. The next day call to check on your luggage. If the answer isn't "We have it here, where can we send it" then go shopping again and buy whatever clothes you need. 

Keep receipts. 

If you're leaving soon, buy a new suitcase. Keep the receipt. 

Folks often hold off on buying replacements because it feels like "wasting money" - but then you strain yourself trying to get by on minimal clothing. This advice was given to me by an airline pilot who was behind me in line for lost luggage - buy what you need when you need it, keep receipts, file a claim. The airline will pay it. 

I've had to do it twice, and both times, even though my cases eventually showed up, the airline reimbursed every penny I filed a claim for. 

(This advice is as of 2007 - YMMV with all the merger madness)
