LPT: If you notice someone is sweating a lot, there is no need to mention it â€” they already know.

I don't know why people always feel the need to mention when someone else is sweating in a social situation. I can guarantee you, they are well aware of it and you letting them know isn't conducive and can actually make things worse. 


Don't be a dick.

EDIT: Unless the comment is because of a genuine concern for the person's immediate health and wellbeing.
