title:
LPT: Parents please PLEASE teach your kids your phone number!

content:
At a very large park today and came across a kid sobbing because she was lost and couldn't find her parents. She was around 7. We offered to help her of course, but the park is huge and she didn't have a clue where her family was. We asked if she knew her parents number and she had no idea. He place is huge and honestly, if I had no one come in 10 min I would be calling the cops.They'd let her bike off on her own then moved the picnic down the hill. Thankfully a family member came after 5 minutes and found us but if she had known their phone number it could have saved a lot of panic

ETA thanks all for  the updoots and the silver! While I hope your kids aren't ever in a position to need this tip, I'm glad it might help if they are!
