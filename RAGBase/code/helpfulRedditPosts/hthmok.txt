YSK that domesticated cats are the top 100 most invasive species in the world and should be kept indoors as to avoid the potential eradication of other species

content:
Keeping a cat indoors is the safest option for for the cat and as long as the cat is provided plenty of tools to exercise their instincts, they are perfectly happy. Besides the benefits of a cat being kept indoors in terms of safety and avoiding illnesses such as FIV, cats are not natural predators in many areas and have single handedly been the cause of endangerment and even extinctions of hundreds of species of birds and other small animals. Please keep your cats indoors and lets not do the environment more harm than we have already done.
