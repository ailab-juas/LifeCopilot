title:
LPT: when asking a girl out (or making plans with your gf) say "I want to take you to..." or "Let's do ... tonight" instead of "Do you want to..."

content:
It's more assertive and displays confidence as well as interest in her. "Do you want to..." is passive and leaves a higher chance for rejection, even though people phrase it this way out of fear of rejection. 

it's not a matter of being rigid, it simply puts your intent bluntly that you have interest in her, and want to spend time with her. if she says, how about we do X instead, great! same purpose. now you have a date. This isn't a tip to do a specific activity you want to do, it's a tip to get a date.
