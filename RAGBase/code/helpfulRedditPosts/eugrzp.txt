LPT Every time your boss commends you for a good job and tells you why, write it down. Look back at it every few months, and choose the best achievements for your resume.

A lot of people forget significant achievements at work and draw a blank during interviews or resume writing time.

As a Team Leader, I'm always happy to help people make their resumes. A lot of the time people think that they just come to work, do their job and we management don't remember your efforts. But a good manager will always remember your greatest achievements because it make everyone look good. Don't be afraid to ask how a job well done affected the company.

That order you just made could have been the fastest in the history of that place.

The time you came in for overtime during a busy day? That proved that you were reliable.

That time you reminded someone to wear their gloves before commencing work? You upheld company safety standards.

That little change you made in operating procedures could have save the company hundreds of thousands a year.

When you talked to someone that was overwhelmed by his job and helped him through the day? That shows great leadership skills and the ability to work under pressure.

In my industry, the little problems can turn into big problems, but little achievements can turn into huge successes.
