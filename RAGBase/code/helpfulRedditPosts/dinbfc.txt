YSK that you can solve cases of child pornography by simply looking through pictures of household items.

EUROPOL, the European international police agency, has stepped up its efforts to combat child pornography and child abuse. One of the most important ways to do so is to identify and rescue the children and teenagers who are being abused, pressured, trafficked or even raped. The most important thing is to find and shield them from further harm, before the police will search for the perpetrators. Investigators often do obtain videos and pictures fro websites or hard drives, but identifying and finding the victims involved is very hard. They have to deduct the surroundings and people from only a few images. **\*\*You can help!\*\***

[Trace An Object - Stop Child Abuse](https://www.europol.europa.eu/stopchildabuse) features various images of common objects from cases/videos of children being sexually exploited. The pictures of these objects are cut out from the raw material, so it ~~is suitable for everyone and~~ protects the identity of the children involved. This includes clothing, children's toys, books, gardens or even entire backgrounds.

You can take a look on the website and look trough the various images and see if you can help with anything. Do you know where a specific kind of shoe is being sold? Have you been to this certain location? Can you identify the country where this picture was taken? If yes, you can directly give tips and hints to Europol anonymously.

EDIT: Judging from the reactions think I underestimated how gruesome and horrifying the images actually are, so I must warn you: **the pictures include scenes and objects that might be very disturbing**, such as silhouettes of children, baby clothing or personal items. I did not mean to make you sick. :/

Update: Wow...! I did not expect this post to receive so much attention! Also, thank you for giving gold to me for this... I am not so experienced with Reddit and I honestly don't know how to react. **Instead of gifting me some gold, consider donating to the preventative project** [**"Kein TÃ¤ter Werden"**](https://www.kein-taeter-werden.de/spenden) in Germany, where non-offenders can learn how to deal with their pedophilia. This is one of the most important ways of preventing further abuse and protecting children. Thank you all and have a wonderful day! Also, I am genuinely considering posting this to the mentioned subreddits.
