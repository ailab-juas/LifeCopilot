LPT: It sucks to be "ghosted" - by friends, potential, employers, anyone - but sometimes no answer IS your answer. Get these people out of your life and move on.

content:
With potential employers, unless you are already famous and one of the few true experts in your field, they will always be more important to you than you are to them. Waiting sucks, but there are plenty of jobs that just never get back to you, even after you have interviewed. 

With friends, I'm afraid it means the same thing, you just aren't as important to them as they are to you. Don't keep these people in your life.

"Closure" is rarely something someone else can give to you. It has to come from yourself. It's about processing the experience and making peace with it on your own terms.
