LPT: When you buy a new computer (Windows) always do a reset. This will remove all the unwanted pre-installed programs. Run the initial startup, then hold the shift key while clicking restart. Then it's troubleshooting, reset, and remove everything. Better than uninstaling one by one.

Also works for viruses and corrupted Windows files. Just click keep personal files option.
