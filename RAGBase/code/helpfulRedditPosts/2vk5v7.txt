LPT: Sometimes it's better to know how to take a joke then make one.

content:
Basically, if you don't have a sense of humor or a thick skin, people won't enjoy your company as much. Give it as good as you take it if you can, friends who laugh together last longer.

EDIT: To everyone who has had their jimmies rustled, I understand that there's a clear difference between a joke between friends and being a dick. I also understand that in a perfect world, everyone would be nice to everyone. As this is not the case, your jimmies are likely to be rustled quite often. Whatever.

Sorry about my grammer.
