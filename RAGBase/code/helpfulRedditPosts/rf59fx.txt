YSK: Even slow-moving water presents incredible risk. Trying to move across a fast-moving stream or flood water is suicide. A 1-meter cube of water is the definition of a ton. Imagine the water as 1 ton cubes moving at that speed, and you will see how cars get swept away trying to cross.

Why YSK:

Many people vastly underestimate the forces even small bodies of water can impart.

There's a silly little rule of thumb that's actually pretty helpful. If you dropped a flower in the water, would you have time to bend down and pick it up, or is flowing away out of reach by the time you did?

If you can pick it up, you're fine.

If not, basically, if the water goes over your ankles you can be taken off your feet at any moment, mind the rocks, but are okayish.

If it goes over your knees, you're at serious risk of being taken by the stream.

If you're trying to move something with a large surface area, like the wheels of a car, or god help you its deep enough to be pushing on the whole sides of the car, you're fucked.

Moving bodies of water contain incredible energies, water is really, really dense. I mean just think about picking up a big bucket of the stuff.

I see a lot of people drive cars over roads that have flooded and are in motion, and every time I wish I could scream at them before they go in.

Water is so dense, that whole ass car only weighs as much as 1-2 cubic meters of water. Its surface area can have a LOT more than that pushing on it.

Your car absolutely will not win.
