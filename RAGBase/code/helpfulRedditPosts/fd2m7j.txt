title:
YSK that BBC has one of the biggest and best recipe collections available for free, and since they are a public service, they have no ads, no walls of text, just recipes

content:
Google has transformed every recipe web into a wall of text that they are forced to write if they don't want SEO to screw them.

Fortunately for us, BBC is a public institution and they don't need to do it. The collection is massive and has the recipes right away.

The web is https://bbc.co.uk/food

Edit: as several comments have pointed out, there is also https://www.bbcgoodfood.com
