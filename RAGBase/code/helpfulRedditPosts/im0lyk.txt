YSK: If you look bad in photos it doesn't mean you don't look good in real life.

Why YSK: So, I know a lot of people who look good in real life but their pictures come out bad (and vice versa). The only reason is they don't know how to pose correctly or the camera is a smartphone, these people just say they aren't photogenic and might laugh at that but I know how it feels. 

Even I was insecure about my looks for most of my life because my photos were not how I thought I looked like. I only got over it after a friend with a DSLR took the time out to teach me how to pose and how to smile for a photo.

Don't get depressed about your looks just because you don't look good enough in photos. Don't be too critical of yourself, a camera might never capture your beauty but other people will!
