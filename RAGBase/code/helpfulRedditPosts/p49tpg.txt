LPT: try teaching yourself to do simple manual tasks (e.g. putting shampoo in your hair, pushing the microwave buttons, etc.) with your non-dominant hand when not in a rush. It will increase your overal motor skills and youâ€™ll be prepared in case you injure your dominant hand/wrist/arm for a while.
