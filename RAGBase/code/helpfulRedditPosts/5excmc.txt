LPT: If you're dreading an upcoming event, don't think about the event itself, but what's going to come after.

Like, if there's an upcoming exam that's causing you a lot of stress, don't think about it in terms of, "In two weeks there's an exam, and if I fail it my life is over." Think about it in terms of, "After two weeks, the source of my immense stress will be gone." This can apply to a lot of other things and can alleviate a lot of stress in the long run.
