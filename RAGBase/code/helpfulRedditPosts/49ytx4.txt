LPT: If you screw up and inconvenience someone, apologize once, then move on (by correcting your mistake if possible). Apologizing repeatedly &amp; profusely doesn't help anything, it's just you trying to make yourself feel better.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. Apparently i a) hit on something a lot of people either really agreed with or needed to hear, and also b) am singlehandedly destroying this sub by posting advice on decent adult behaviour instead of, i dunno, how to tie your shoes better or something (hint: reverse the first over-under; it'll feel weird to do but your knot won't slip).

TO CLARIFY: This was meant to be advice for situations of a MINOR nature, screw-ups like being late for an appointment or scratching someone's DVD by accident. Small stuff. If you really hurt someone, or betray their trust in a serious way, YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE. A lot. Until the person you wronged decides you're done, keep apologizing. Like so:

/r/LifeProTips i'm REALLY sorry i posted something i thought would be useful or interesting but wasn't what you want to see from this subreddit. I'm seriously really sorry; i'm new here. I won't do it again. Sorry. Really. 

Also: If you need to remember to do something tomorrow, change your phone's lock screen to an image that will remind you of it.
