YSK: If someone doesn’t want to celebrate their birthday, it’s not okay for you to force a celebration on them, interrupt their life with some embarrassing surprise, and harass them until they finally give in.

Why YSK: You may say that you just want them to know you care about them.  But the message you’re sending the person is that you don’t care about their feelings, because you’re doing exactly what they asked you not to do.  They will end up resenting you, and hate celebrating it even more
