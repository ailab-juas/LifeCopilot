LPT: If your car is totaled in a wreck, you can counter the payout amount the insurance offers

content:
My car was rear ended by a commercial refrigerated truck and completely totaled. The wreck wasn't my fault and when the other driver's insurance sent over a payout amount I was surprised at just how much below book value their offer was. I didn't know that you are allowed to counter their offer until I searched for why the payout was so low. You can search cars for sale near you that are comparable to yours and send back a counter offer. The comparable cars the insurance listed didn't have several features of my car and I would have sold myself short by accepting their first offer. Negotiating the payout netted an additional $2000! No harm in trying.
