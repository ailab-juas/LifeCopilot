LPT: When running late for work, whether you call in or not, don't show up with a cup of coffee you bought along the way.

I could have posed this to "TIFU", but it happened a long time ago. I didn't have a great night of sleep - ~2-3 hrs at best. I normally wake up at 5:00 AM to leave at 5:40. I forgot to set my alarm, and it was my infant daughter's crying that actually woke me at 5:25. I showered and dressed as quickly as I could, but I was still running 5-10 min late. I called my boss and he calmly said, "No worries." I needed some coffee to keep my eyes open, so I stopped and bought a cup at McDonald's. When I got to the office, my boss first looked at me - exhausted and frantic - and he smirked and said, "Glad you could join us." Then he saw the McDonald's cup in my hand and the smile quickly left his face. He didn't have to say a word. He could have opened the rule book, turned to the "Company Policy on Lateness" section, and wrote me up. He was trying to cut me some slack, and I took advantage of his kindness.
