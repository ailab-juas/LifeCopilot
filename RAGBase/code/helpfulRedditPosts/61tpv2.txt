LPT: Text your dad right now and tell him you're thinking of him and that you love him. Mine would've been 49 today. You never know how much time you have.

Edit: I'm sorry if your relationship with your dad sucks, please feel free to replace the word dad with any proper noun that makes the LPT work for you.
