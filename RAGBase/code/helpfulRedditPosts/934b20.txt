LPT: Make the habit of using questions instead of judgement on scenarios where you’re trying to express your opinion

content:
I’ve been using this tip particularly with my family in the regular basis. I no longer tell my wife “you look like you didn’t sleep right”, instead I ask “how did you sleep?” Or to my daughters, instead of “you broke this toy” I would say “what happened to the toy?” and let them explain. This has helped me be seem as more understanding, less accusatory and gives others the opportunity to rationalize and explain the situation. This also helps them vent and respect me more for not jumping into conclusions, but ultimately this helps avoid conflict. 

Edit: 

⚠️ this may not work in every case. Use judgment.
