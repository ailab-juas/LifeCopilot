LPT: Don’t kill yourself working for a company that would fill your position before your funeral.

I’m not sure where that quote is from but once I heard it my thoughts on work completely changed. I was always the one going the extra mile, putting in more hours than was reasonable (or likely healthy), and in the end I was replaced by someone who would work for significantly less money (This was years ago and the company has lost more than half its business since.)

By no means am I saying be lazy, don’t put in effort, or anything like that. But understand that you truly are just a cog in the wheel of your workplace and that it should be a cog in the wheel of your life. So, SO many define themselves by their work and the value they bring to the table, and having a strong work ethic is great - just know that you likely see yourself as more integral than the company does and it cares about you only to the extent that you serve its purposes in the manner it wants, for the price it wants.
