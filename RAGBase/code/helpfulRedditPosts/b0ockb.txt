LPT: never tell friends and family you’re really into something(collections, movies, fandom) you’ll never receive a gift you like again.

So my family all know that I love Star Wars and I do. For years and years all I ever receive at birthdays, Christmas, etc. is Star Wars. Oh my god the crap I’ve gotten that I have no interest in. Darth Vader toaster, r2d2 salt shakers, ugly T-shirts. Yes I love Star Wars, but it’s not my life and I don’t want everything in my home Star Wars themed. 

No one ever gets me storm trooper armor or lightsaber hilts. No, just tchotchke.
