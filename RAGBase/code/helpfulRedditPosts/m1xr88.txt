YSK: When buying a suit, it’s generally expected that you will get the suit tailored to you so that it fits better. Plan to buy the suit at least a week ahead of when you need it to allow for the tailoring time.

Why YSK: it’s common to buy suits for an event like weddings or interviews, but unless you’re dropping a boatload of money on the suit it is unlikely to fit you very well. Tailoring also isn’t expensive like you might think and it really adds an extra level to your presentation. Here (nyc) I can get a suit tailored for ~$50 and it’ll take 3-5 days to complete.

Edit: some people are mentioning that it will likely cost more than $50 to tailor which is true. Number of adjustments being done to the suit, number of tailors in your city/town, and quality of tailor will all affect the cost. I’ve been lucky to only need 1-3 adjustments done on average for my suits and I probably should have mentioned that this is an anecdotal number. Your mileage may vary.
