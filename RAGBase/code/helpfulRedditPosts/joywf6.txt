LPT: If you're gonna tell something upsetting to your relative or love ones, if it's not that urgent, say it after their work/school. It would help not to ruin their focus for the rest of the day and they can sleep on it if they can.

I wasn't clear about the level of news that upsets someone. This definitely is situational and does not apply to anything related to death, someone passed away, someone is sick, or anything like that. Lighter upsetting news, I would say that this would apply.

Upsetting news is upsetting, nothing is gonna change that, the life pro tip here is the impact on what you are currently doing AND if it's NOT URGENT and it's acceptable to know it after not during.

Thanks to some that were able to relate!
