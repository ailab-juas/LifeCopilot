LPT: if you travel a lot, have a unique lock screen on your phone for easier identification.

Or if you don't travel a lot but leave your phone in businesses- coffeeshops, bars, restaurants.

As someone who worked security for a large convention hotel I've had the frustration of trying to help patrons not on the property anymore (they checked out, are already at the airport) figure out if I have their phone in Lost &amp; Found. Between having both business and personal cellphones and the waiting around that happens at convention hotels between checkouts and flights I often had slightly absurd numbers of phones turned in to my office all at once.

"Its an iPhone, in a black case, with a (came-with-the-phone lockscreen image) ""Yeah, I have three of those""It's really chewed up on the corners?""Were down to two!"

Use a photo you took- a rock (mine is a lava field), a flower, your favorite shoes, the toe beans of your cat, someone elses' cat- something unique that you can describe to me and I can see matches what you're telling me. Then I can definitively say YES, I have your phone, what's the best way to get it back to you?

if you're really bad about losing your phone, write out an "if found, call ##### or email soandso@address subject 'found phone'." and use that photo as your lock screen.

Edit: I see a lot of people didn't read the "help patrons not on the property anymore". This tip work when you don't know where your phone is and you're calling places to see if you left it there. But sure, borrowing one phone to call a place and then borrowing a second phone to call your phone to identify it would work too.
