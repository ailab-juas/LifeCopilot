LPT: Put your complete bedding sheets set inside the sets pillowcase. This way it's easier to grab a complete set at once.

A couple times I've had visitors over and I spent way too much time trying to find a matching fitted sheet with pillow cases and a bed sheet. Now I just fold all the sheets and tuck them nicely inside the remaining pillow case. This might be common knowledge, but just a LPT for those who don't know!
