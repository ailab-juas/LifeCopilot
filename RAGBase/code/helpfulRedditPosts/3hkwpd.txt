YSK if you are being docked 30 minutes at work for a break you never take, you are owed those unpaid wages

..too often, people just roll over and accept shit like this

I just wanted to share an experience I had several years ago with this problem

 a place I worked at was taking out 30 minutes for breaks from my daily hourly total...

Here's the thing, we NEVER had time for breaks. I told my boss how I felt about the situation and he basically didn't give a shit. So my next move was to HR. I went there assuming they could just stop deducting my 30 minute break that I was never taking. This opened up a whole can of worms. My boss was furious I went over his head and got him in trouble. Things never changed which ultimately led me to leave that place...


A month went by and I decided to call the department of labor. I told them the situation which they told me to go back demand my unpaid wages be paid in full. I said "what if they refuse"... I remember the guy laughingly saying "call me back" ..

The following day, I went to HR and explained my situation. (They were soooo pissed off)
They caved and had to cut me a check for all those hours.. The kicker? All those hours were paid at 1.5x my hourly rate due to the fact I always worked atleast 45 hours/week

The next week, all employees at that place had to sign a waiver acknowledging they must take a break or are relinquishing it with no pay
