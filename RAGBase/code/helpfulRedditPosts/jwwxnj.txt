LPT: If someone mentions something in passing two or three times, even over the course of weeks or years, ask them about it.

content:
When people repeat things it's a pretty heavy indication that it's occupying their mind in some manner. I've found that almost every time it's productive to ask about it, regardless of what it is that they're bringing up. 

Is it a decision they made? Maybe it's weighing on them heavily or in unexpected ways and would like to talk it out.

An anecdote? Maybe there's a funny or personal story to go with it or one they haven't had the chance to tell anyone.

Complaint? You can learn a lot about a person through even the small things they find annoying. If you're lucky, you might be able to even work towards a resolution.

Is it a hobby, interest, or even a reference you didn't catch? People love talking about their interests, and if you're willing to listen you can learn a lot.

It obviously goes without saying that the usefulness of this technique fades the more a subject is discussed. If someone's complaining about the same thing over and over again you may not want to re-engage that conversation and create a negative feedback loop. On the whole, though, I find that people have a lot to offer for those that are willing to listen - but sometimes might be shy or feel awkward in a given moment about presenting themselves.
