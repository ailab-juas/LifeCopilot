title:
YSK that in states that have legalized marijuana it is still very illegal in any national parks, monuments and forests; and park rangers are federal police.

content:
On federal land (National Parks, National Monuments, Bureau of Land Management lands, National Forests, etc) federal law is enforced and marijuana is still a schedule one drug.  

If you get busted by a ranger on federal land you must appear in court, which will be the courthouse of whatever district you were busted in, these areas are very large.  There is no paying the fine without trial even though it will probably be a minor fine, same with speeding tickets and any other infraction, so don't mess around of federal land.
