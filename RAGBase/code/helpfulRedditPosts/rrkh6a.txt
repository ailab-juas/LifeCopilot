LPT: sometimes being a good friend means doing something without asking.

content:

I have a friend I’ll call “H”, H has been going through the shit and depression has set in deep. H seems jovial on the outside, but their house tells a very different story. H is not a messy person usually, but their house is dirtier every time I’m over there. I’ve asked H if I can help them clean in the past but they emphatically tell me no. Well, the other day I went over and the toilet was probably one of the dirtiest toilets I’ve ever seen. So I locked myself in and cleaned the entire bathroom top to bottom without saying a word. I made an excuse that I was having stomach problems and that’s why I took so long, and then I left. H later called me crying and said that was the most kindness they’ve received since everything started going on. Sometimes people are too prideful or embarrassed to accept help, that doesn’t mean that they don’t need it.
