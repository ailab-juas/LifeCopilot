YSK - in a survival situation, cook things in water instead of fire

Why YSK - you will get the best and the most of nutrients if you cook anything you forage, hunt or fish in the wild in some water instead of grilling it on the fire, it is also the most efficient way to share equally with someone in case you're not alone.
We often see on surviving shows and movies people putting food directly in the fire or eating it raw, that's the worst way to cook nutritionally efficient for surviving. If you have the choice to cook everything in a pot of water (or whatever container you have available) do it that way, joints in the bones and the skin will break into collagen and that will be more easily and quickly absorbed by your body, organs that are rich in vitamins and minerals will also break up and infuse the broth with nutrition, plants and mushrooms are often more safe and easily digested when cooked in water, and you can always use this method to mush everything evenly so you can share better (it's much more difficult to share a fish or a lizard in two equal pieces when it's roasted). Unripe fruits can be hard to digest and even dangerous to eat when not ripe, cooking them is also the best practice if you find any. Roasted vegetables or meat can get burnt pieces and these burnt bits are just gone calories and nutrition, whatever gets burned is not used by our body and in a survival situation, any calories, carbs and protein are vital. Surely not the tastiest, but definitely the most efficient.
