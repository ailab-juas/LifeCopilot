LPT: If you see a baby animal by itself and it looks healthy, its mom is just probably off finding food, leave it be.

content:
Almost all moms have to leave their babies at some point to go and get food.  They are not abandoned, leave them be.  If they are in a particularly unsafe spot, you can move them to a safer location (as long as it is not too far away, the mom can call for it and find it again).  

If they look sick or malnourished then by all means, help the little bugger.
