title:
LPT: Parenting tip, take a photo of your kids before heading out anywhere crowded.

content:
If you head out with young kids to an amusement park or the beach, or generally any crowded area, take a picture of your kids at the start of the day. 

If you then get separated or one of your kids wander off, you can then show people exactly what they look like instead of a vague description.
