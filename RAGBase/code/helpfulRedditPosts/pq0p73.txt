LPT: If your dog runs up to someone and they ask you to call the dog back, your first response should be "HERE!" or whatever your recall cue is, not "Why?", "He just wants to play" or "It's okay he's friendly".

content:
It doesn't matter why they've requested it but there's a good chance that it's for your own dogs safety.

Perhaps the person is scared of dogs.

Maybe they're with a child who is scared of dogs.

They might have a dog on a lead who is dog aggressive or scared of other dogs.

There could be machinery that's dangerous for your dog to be around.

They might have livestock with them.

They might have spotted other wildlife that could either cause harm to or be harmed by your dog.

But it doesn't matter. Honour the request and call your dog back, then if you're curious, you can ask why or what's happening. If you don't take heed of the warning and your dog gets injured then it's your fault. If your dog is improperly trained and you *can't* call your dog back then A) it's again your fault if it gets injured and B) it has no business being off lead.
