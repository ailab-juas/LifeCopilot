LPT Learning when to stop talking is more important than to know when to start talking.

content:
It takes  a lot of perceptive intelligence and experience to know when to shut up and let the silence speak for itself .Most effective conversationalists and speakers dont just go on and on but remain silent  in all the right times.
It saves us from a lot if additional trouble and sometimes giving unnecessary details.
Not everyone needs to know everything.
