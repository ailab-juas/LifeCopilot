YSK About Frog Logs if you have a swimming pool to help save the lives of some critters

content:
There is an inexpensive thing called a [Frog Log](https://i.imgur.com/pdEETAP.jpg) that is a bridge from the water to the ground to allow critters who have fallen into the pool to escape with their lives.

It's better than fishing out the poor unfortunate souls that don't make it.
