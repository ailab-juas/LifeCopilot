title:
LPT - You may be taking Melatonin incorrectly

content:
Melatonin doesn't take 45+ minutes to break down like a typical pill. Many people take it &amp; go about their evenings, then wonder why it's not working.

Because it's a hormone, Melatonin only has about a 30 minute window to work, if you miss the window it won't take effect.

What you want to do is take it as you're getting into bed. Turn out the lights &amp; close your eyes, in 30 minutes you should be knocked out.

Edit: As several people have stated, less is more. Stick with doses under 5mg, that 10mg stuff will have you waking up in about 4 hours, low doses will help you sleep the whole night.
