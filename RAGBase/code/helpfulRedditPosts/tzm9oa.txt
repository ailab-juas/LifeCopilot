YSK that almost every county in the US has a Cooperative Extension that exists to help your community.

content:
Why YSK... Cooperative Extension is connected to whatever college has the land grant in your state. The sole purpose is to better communities and most people who work for them are genuinely so good and helpful. 

The history is super interesting and I believe not very well known. Most people, if they know anything know about the agriculture aspect and 4H, but they do so much.

I work for Cooperative Extension in Arizona and I work under a grant that delivers free education for parents and emerging adults about managing finances and positive parenting.

If you have any trouble with gardening or need soil tested, make friends with Cooperative Extension!
