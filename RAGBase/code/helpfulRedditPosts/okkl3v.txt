YSK that your iPhone can scan documents

Why YSK: With recent comments in the news about how many rural folks cannot easily photocopy a document — your iPhone can do so. (Android too, maybe?)

Open a new note in the Notes app, then click on the camera and choose “scan documents”. This is not the same as taking a picture of a piece of paper! It identifies the edges of your document, squares it off, and saves it as a PDF. I’ve used this for signed contracts and the other parties could not tell a difference.
