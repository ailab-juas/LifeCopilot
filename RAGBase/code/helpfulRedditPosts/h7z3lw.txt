title:
YSK: it is illegal for companies to prevent or prohibit you from talking about your pay and working conditions with coworkers

content:
It's common practice, but not legal in any sense, even if they have company policies. Also not legal to fire you for doing it. 

Edit: This is referring to the US, but I encourage anyone else to look into laws in their countries. A lot of them have similar laws.
