YSK that GMO foods are safe to grow and eat, have fewer mycotoxins, reduce the use of pesticides, have increased shelf life, increased crop yields, increased nutrients, and have less environmental impacts when growing than non-GMO foods.

Also, GMO corn crops had lower percentages of mycotoxins (-28.8 percent), fumonisins (-30.6 percent) and thricotecens (−36.5 percent), all of which can lead to economic losses and harm human and animal health”)

GM food is also known to taste better, need fewer pesticides to grow, have an increased shelf life, and are higher in nutrients than non-GM food)

In conclusion, GM crops are safe to grow and consume, pose no health risks for humans or livestock, increase crop yields, are larger in size, have more nutritional benefits, increased shelf life, need fewer pesticides to grow, have lower levels of mycotoxins, are more environmentally friendly to grow, AND are more profitable than non-GM crops.

To be anti-GMO is to be pro-pesticide, pro-environmental degradation, and anti-science.
