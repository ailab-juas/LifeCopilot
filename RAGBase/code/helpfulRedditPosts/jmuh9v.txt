LPT: If you're sick of getting spam or phising texts, you can Fwd the texts to "7726" to report it to the FTC and have your carrier investigate it. This applies across the US and is not carrier specific. It works like reporting spam in Gmail.

Edit 1: Got some questions about spam and robo calls. I ain't got much on how to tackle those because of the nature in which spammers get ahold of your number and spoof others. But here's an FTC article about what you can do in the meantime.

Wish I knew about this tip several months ago, given the season Finale of America being tomorrow and all. But alas, we can [hopefully] use this tip for future elections.

Edit 2: apparently it's the same number if you're reporting from Canada. Don't quote me on that though. Def not a Canadian.

Edit 5: Edit 4 was supposed to be U K. My keyboard is a tad stupid.

Edit 6: oh Buddha, didn't think this post would get to this point. Here's some extra links and a reminder, when in doubt remember: GTS = Google that Shit. 


How to fwd on Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208386

How to fwd on Android: this changes so often that you're better off Googling [your phone] + "forwarding texts". 


Alright friends. You now have a way to report spam for US, Canada, and the UK, &amp; how to fwd texts on iPhone and etc. IDK about the rest of the world but the internet is there so do the thing. 

Side note: Apparently in the US, political spam is not filtered no matter what you do. Sad. But remember to be kind regardless.  Automated or not there's a human on the other end. We don't need anymore sad things in 2020. Or ever. 

Now the effectiveness of these methods are up to you. Work or not work - y'all decide. Dont shoot the messenger. I am but a small potato. 

Also, DONT click the links. If you do, change your password. If it's a password you use anywhere else, change it immediately too! Please be safe in the digital world! Thank you for all the love. üíï
 

Edit 7??: 

Don't click link. Don't fwd the link. Apparently  each look different to the user?? Idk and Idfk what I'm doing anymore. Gotta be up to vote at 5. Please stay safe tomorrow y'all. ü§üüèª

EDIT 8: FRICK. I AM SO OVERWHELMED. SO MANY AWARDS. SO MANY POINTS WHERE I CLEARLY DONT KNOW ENOUGH TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR AM FLAT OUT WRONG. REMEMBER GTS. GTS IT ALLLL AHHHHHHHHHHH!!


HERE'S SOME DAD JOKES TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE LOVE AND AWARDS: 

What do you call someone with no body and no nose? Nobody knows.

What did the drummer name his twin daughters? Anna 1, Anna 2! 

Two goldfish are in a tank. One says to the other: "do you know how to drive this thing?".


Edit 9:
