LPT: If someone interrupts a storyteller to steal the spotlight, maintain eye contact with the original speaker to encourage them and discourage the interrupter.

content:
Many times a more enthusiastic or extroverted conversationalist will attempt to hijack a story to have the moment of glory, but discourage this behavior by continuing to engage the original speaker instead of turning your attention to the hijacker. It will also discourage and subtly inform the hijacker of their rudeness without calling them out in a humiliating way.
