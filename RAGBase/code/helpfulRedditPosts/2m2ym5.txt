LPT: If you find it difficult to maintain eye contact with an intimidating person, stare at their eyebrows instead.

content:
Unless your face is inches away from theirs, they won't be able to tell that you're not actually making eye contact with them.

Edit: So I just woke up to about a million replies and realised that this somehow managed to make it to the front page. Just my luck that the only post I've ever had hit the front page is a self post, lol. 

I just want to add that I don't have social anxiety or autism- just thought it would be fun to share a tip I learnt years ago that helped me deal with an extremely intimidating high school teacher.
