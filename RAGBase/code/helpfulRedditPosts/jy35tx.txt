YSK Christmas cards that “sing” or play a melody when opened are not recyclable and the PCBs inside produce a lot of E-waste.

content:
Why YSK: Coming into Christmas try to avoid buying these cards. Inside each is a small speaker and circuit board, a lot of the time containing mercury and other harmful substances. 

The card itself isn’t recyclable with these still inside, so if you do get one, don’t throw it straight in the trash!
