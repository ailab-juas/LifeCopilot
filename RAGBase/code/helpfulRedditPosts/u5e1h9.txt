LPT: Please wear sunscreen!

content:
Five biopsies, three surgeries, and 15 rounds of radiation later I am finally finished with treatment for my various skin cancers. Please do better than I did and wear sunscreen. Also, go see a dermatologist at the first hint you might have something. I didn't, and I've paid the price.
