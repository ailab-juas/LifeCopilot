LPT: If your phone screen breaks (but still functions) and you have to wait to save up enoug for a new one, put a tempered glass screen protector on it. It may seem like it's "too little, too late," but it'll keep pieces from falling out or moisture from getting in, which would make it stop working.

Edit: To address the users saying "just put a screen protector on it as soon as you get it" ... yes. Obviously.

That's what everyone *should* do. Unfortunately, it doesn't always go that way. We don't always do the smartest thing first, and life happens. Phone screens get broken every day. You can't go back in time and un-break your already broken phone with this advice. This is a tip to address what to do if you made this mistake and it already happened. 

I could have made a post that said "LPT: put a screen protector on your phone to avoid screen cracks." I didn't. I chose to share a tip that has worked for me before, in case others need it because they didn't get a screen protector for whatever reason. That's kinda the whole point here, not "protect your phone before it breaks."
