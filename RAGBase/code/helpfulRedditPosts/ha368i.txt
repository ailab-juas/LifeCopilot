title:
YSK if someone is telling you about their good news, do not tell them your news and ruin their moment.

content:
If someone calls you or meets you with excitement and starts telling their story, don't interrupt them and for god's sake don't start pimping your story. It's their moment, let them enjoy it.
Just listen to them and acknowledge.
All they want is to be heard .
So don't be a dick. Listen.
