YSK what to do if you think you are being followed

content:
I never thought it could happen to me, but it did.

I was coming home from work and merged into a busy lane. The driver behind gave me plenty of space to maneuver and I gave him a courtesy hand wave after I merged. From that point on, he began following me. This driver mimic all my lane changes and took all my turns. Even as I entered a residential area, he still continued to maintain a two car length distance. I tried making eye contact with him to see if he was road-raging, but he was wearing sunglasses - in the evening. My mind started to race, I was getting closer to my home, I wasn't thinking straight... and I made a huge mistake.

# So, YSK what to do if you are being followed...

TL;DR - DO NOT GO HOME IF YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED - even if you think you are. Instead, continue driving and call the police immediately. Try to gather as much description as possible and do not attempt to confront the other person.

Here is a little guide which goes into further detail about being followed:

**Why would someone follow you?**

&gt;Don't bother trying to understand the other person's reasoning. They could be a Private Investigator, a kidnapper, a family or a best friend's crazy ex. -you just don't know. In the here and now, assume they are going to do you harm.

**How do you know if someone is following you?**

&gt;You should maintain situational awareness of your surroundings at all time. Whether it is something monotonous like daily driving to and from work or loading groceries in your car at a parking lot, always pay attention to your environment and keep an eye out on anomalies (like being followed by the same person for 20m). And don't forget to listen to your gut! A simple intuitive feeling can be an ounce of prevention that is worth a pound of cure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the Moscow Rules which I found helpful distinguishing someone following me by accident vs. someone with deliberate intentions.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Moscow\_rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moscow_rules)

1. One time = an accident
2. Two times = a coincidence
3. Three times = enemy action

**Are you being paranoid?**

&gt;You can try to take the following actions if you want to be 100% sure you are being followed:

* Light up your turn signal and see if they do it too. But do not take your required turn and keep driving straight. Did they go straight to?
* Continue driving around in a circle. Most people don't drive around in circles. Are they still behind you?
* Make a safe maneuver which you normally would not take, like a U turn or drive in/out of a fast food parking lot. Are they still behind you?
* Go onto a freeway and immediately get off. Did they do the same?

**Someone is following me...now what?**

&gt;Again, do not go home if you suspect you are being followed. Gather as much information as possible *as you call the police*: license plate, vehicle make, vehicle color, sex, race, hair and eye color, build, age, distinguished markings on the car, etc.

&gt;Do not attempt to stop the vehicle or attempt to leave the vehicle. You are much safer inside the car than on the outside. And do NOT attempt to confront the other person. You should drive yourself to a police station or a fire department.  If you do not know these locations, continue driving in a well-lit/public area until the police operator gives you further instructions.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the person behind you starts to get aggressive, you may have to use Startrek + 2F2F maneuvers. And if necessary, use evasive maneuvers to distance yourself from the potential threat; i.e. they get out of their car and begin to approach your vehicle at a stop sign/red light.

Remember, like the rules of boxing, "defend yourself at all times." You should be vigilant, calm, and stay in control of your thoughts. Do not panic if you are being followed. And do not think it could never happen to you!

For those wondering about my mistake...^(I accidentally went straight home). I was so confused (and a little pissed) to why this person was following me that I parked my car and ^(got out of my vehicle to confront the driver). Luckily (?) the driver never turned into my parking lot. Instead, he took the only exit which led him into the opposite direction of the main road he followed me on. I filed a report and nothing has happened to me or my car since.
