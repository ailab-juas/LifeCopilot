title:
LPT: After you graduate from college, request an alumni email account. That way, you get access to all of the .edu perks + discounts you used as a student again.

content:
If you loved the benefits of having a .edu account as a student, then you’ll continue loving it after college. If your university provides .edu accounts for alum, you’ll be able to use the account for a lot of the same benefits students get. 

It’s not fool proof. Some companies use SheerID to verify student enrollment but some companies provide educational benefits for all .edu holders, students, and instructors.
