YSK That Police Stations Are Probably The Safest Place To Meet Up With Strangers When Buying/Selling Over The Internet

content:
Why YSK: If you're looking for deals from private parties, or selling something as a private party, the meeting place for the transaction should be somewhere safe.  Police stations are just about the safest place you can meet publicly, and also act as a filter against people with bad intentions.

I'm currently selling a high-priced item as a private party, and told a prospective buyer who wanted to see the item that he should meet me at my local police station.  He refused, and suggested a McDonald's parking lot in a sketchy neighborhood instead.  His refusal to meet at the police station sounded my alarm bells, especially when he couldn't articulate his objections to meeting there.  I called off the deal with him, and instead went with the next prospective buyer who not only had no objections to meeting at the police station, but expressed his appreciation for doing so at such a safe place.

P.S.  Many police stations not only support this activity, but some will also provide a police officer to be present during the transaction upon request.

EDIT: For everyone saying this only works if you're white/caucasian, but it doesn't if  you're a person of color, please stop.  I'm white &amp; have met with people of EVERY skin tone at police stations, at all times of day.  There has never ONCE been an incident for me or anyone I've met with.  I know YMMV, but can we please stop with the generalizations?
