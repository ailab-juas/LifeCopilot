LPT: When petting a dog that is overly submissive, pet/rub their chests not their heads. This will boost their confidence.

Firstly you should never pet a scared dog, especially if you don't know it.

My wife and I foster shelter dogs that are about to be euthanized and train them for CGC certification then adopt them into loving homes. One of the common problems we see are from a dog that was most likely previously abused is that it doesn't know if you are going to hit it or pet it. Petting/rubbing their chest is a submissive gesture that almost instantly conveys that you are not going to harm the dog and that you are indeed praising it. This works for two reasons. One you are forfeiting the high ground by using a non dominating approach and two that is an approach that most likely has never resulted in punishment/pain.

Edit: Thank you for all the kind words. I was honestly hesitant to post this because of how scrutinizing reddit can be. I hope this will be able to help someone and their pup.

I don't think this works on cats

All those asking questions I'll do my best to answer all of them that I can.
