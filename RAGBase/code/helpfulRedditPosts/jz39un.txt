YSK: There are not 8 types of burnout. The classic burnout inventory in psychological research has 3 dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal achievement.

**Why YSK:** There was a post today that blew up describing the "8 types" of burnout. This is not a peer-reviewed typology, and in fact came from a blog (see: [https://www.workingmother.com/identifying-types-of-burnout](https://www.workingmother.com/identifying-types-of-burnout)). Burnout is a real and important phenomenon, but we need to know how to properly conceptualize and measure it in order to address it. Researchers spend their *whole lives* studying these topics. So at best, pop psychology provides an incomplete understanding of the issue, and at worst, an inaccurate and misleading one.

The Maslach Burnout Inventory measures 3 dimensions of burnout:

* emotional exhaustion: feeling you can't "give of" yourself anymore; are severely lacking psychological resources
* depersonalization/cynicism: negative attitudes towards others or towards the job (also: withdrawal or detachment, irritability, negative thoughts towards the job or those you encounter on the job)
* reduced personal achievement: the tendency to evaluate yourself and your work negatively (feeling like you are unaccomplished; like your work is insufficient)

The MBI was originally oriented towards healthcare professionals but paved the way for research in burnout across occupations.
