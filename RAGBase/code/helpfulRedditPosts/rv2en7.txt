LPT: Don’t go the extra mile at your job

content:
Most jobs today, particularly if you’re not in management or some really high level gig - will *not* reward your hard work.

Most likely situation is that if you push yourself to your limit to be the best employee in the world and make the company you work for rich, you’ll see very little, if any direct benefit to yourself. The money you make the company will be pocketed by management and bosses, and the good job you do; they’ll just take credit for - so don’t be exploited. Your reward for hard work will be more work. 

You only have one life, and you don’t want to kill yourself trying to climb a ladder that, statistically, you won’t ever climb. The United States consistently ranks pretty low on most economic  upward mobility metrics - that’s just a statistical reality. Granted it’s better than most 3rd world countries but…hey, perception is everything I guess. 

Regardless, an employee who will run themselves ragged for as little money as possible is every companies dream - but it’s an equal exchange of labor for payment - what you get in that exchange matters too. 

Do the minimum to not get fired, or at least, a well enough job -  and enjoy your life. Put your friendships and family first, don’t define your life by working. 

You will be a lot happier that way.

EDIT: I’m seeing a lot of “well, you get experience!” in the comments, and while that’s true and totally fair - experience doesn’t pay bills. It don’t keep the lights on or put food on the table, and it doesn’t replace watching your kids grow up and take their first steps.
