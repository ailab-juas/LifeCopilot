title:
YSK that Human Resources (HR) protects the company, NOT the employee(s)

content:
One of the most heartbreaking examples of misplaced trust that I see unfolding regularly is this: someone has an interpersonal conflict at their job, and they're either advised to take it up with HR or they think that is the common sense approach. 

What those people haven't yet learned the hard way, is that a company's Human Resources department wants to keep the company itself out of any legal trouble or PR issues. 

This means that if your legitimate issues that you bring to them are more problematic to fix than not, you may find yourself out of a job - all because you turned to the people you thought were there to protect you. 

They're not your friends. 

Seek your own legal counsel instead, as well as workers rights advocates in your local area.
