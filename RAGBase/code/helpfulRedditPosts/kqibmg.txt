LPT: If you're single and young and starting out in your own place, Reconsider getting a pet.

content:
First- Consider the cost of pet food, medical and emergencies for pets.   You can legitimately spend $2000 per year on pets and have zero to show for it.  If you're struggling with basic things like rent or keeping up with credit card payments, that money could solve a lot of your problems. 

Secondly- If you work a full time job, who will let them out?  Is it fair to them to leave  them home without any contact with anyone else for 8-10 hours at a time?  

Finally, If you have to leave your place in a hurry,  (Hurricane evacuation, Fire evacuation, etc) your pets will become a liability with finding places to stay, feeding, and your mobility.  People don't think about this until it happens. Even if you have to evacuate to a Red Cross shelter because of a storm, most don't allow pets.
