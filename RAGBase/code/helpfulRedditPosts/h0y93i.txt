title:
LPT: If your children are breezing through school, you should try to give them a tiny bit more work. Nothing is worse than reaching 11th grade and not knowing how to study.

content:
Edit: make sure to not give your children more of the same work, make the work harder, and/or different. You can also make the work optional and give them some kind of reward.
You can also encourage them to learn something completely new, something like an instrument.
