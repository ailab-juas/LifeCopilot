YSK if you are wearing a mask and it smells bad, it’s not your mask, it’s your breath.

content:
I was sitting in class today, and my classmate with seemingly chronic halitosis stated that his mask smelled bad and he hates wearing them. If you have been this person, please know that it is not your mask!!! Why YSK this? Not only might your bad breath point to poor oral hygiene, but it also means you’ve likely been inconsiderate to others in the past by making them smell your breath in conversations.
