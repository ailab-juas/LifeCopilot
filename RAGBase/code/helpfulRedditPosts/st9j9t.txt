LPT: Let the car pass.

You could have an emergency in a non-emergency vehicle. 

I see so many times that speeding cars being vilified on-line. "The "asshole" was speeding in the left lane, tailgating, and swerving in and out of lanes", etc. People automatically assume that they are speeding for no good reason. And this *could* be the case. However, it could also *not* be the case, as in, that vehicle is dealing with an emergency. For example, the person in the vehicle is rushing to get to the hospital with a pregnant woman in tow. The vehicle could be rushing to the hosital to see their loved one alive for the very last time. There's a million reasons why a driver would risk being pulled over for speeding. 

And, if you are in the left lane (fast lane US), and someone  wants to get around, either get over to the right lane, or do not block them from passing you. Don't be a dick (too). You could end up being the reason someone loses a life.
