LPT: Significantly lower your expectations for Christmas gifts. Expect nothing, so when someone gets you anything, you'll have a genuine positive reaction.

content:
I've seen too many situations where family has opened a gift expecting something else, then trying to cover up their disappointment, they give a half assed "oh ... thank you ... I love it". I have been guilty of it and the best way to prevent that is to imagine something unexpected or nothing in the box/bag. If you wanted to go further, try to imagine something that would be a hassle to deal with or something that would be insulting. Whatever works, but I promise this makes you happier and the gift giver happier and that's what Christmas is all about.
