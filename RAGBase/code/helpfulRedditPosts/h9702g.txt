title:
YSK that if you’re in a grocery store and you place a refrigerated item in a non-refrigerated section of the store, it will have to be thrown out.

content:
Please, at least put it in a fridge even if it’s not the same section (unless it’s raw meat, in which case PLEASE put it back where it belongs).

We have to throw away produce, meats, and dairy products all the time because people just leave them around the store. It’s sad to throw away what could have been perfectly good food.
