LPT: Write down day to day things that annoys you or frustrates you. You never know when you'll come up with a great invention idea.

So I started doing this last week and I finally got a good idea from one! I'll share it because I'll never do anything with it :


Modular bras. My wife was frustrated because she had a breast that is a cup size smaller than her other breast. So I wrote it down and it hit me! A bra where you buy the band, and 2 individual cups. So she'd be able to have a good fitting bra with a DD and D and not have to mess with improper fitting bras. 


I'm curious if anybody else has done this and if it went anywhere! 



Edit: I'd like to clarify some things! When I say "things that frustrate and annoy you" I mean stuff like "goddammit, I am sick of my food burning in the oven because oven times/temperatures vary" not " I hate working and children piss me off too" 


And if you're not the entrepreneur type, you can take your ideas to Google and potentially find common solutions/products pertaining to your problem making your life just a little bit better and less frustrating!
