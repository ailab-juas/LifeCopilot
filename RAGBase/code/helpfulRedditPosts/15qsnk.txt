LPT: if you get Gasoline on your face, use sour cream to stop the chemical burning sensation.

I was changing the fuel line on a 1970 vw bus. I had eye protection on. The line slipped and I got a face full of gasoline. I plugged the line and went to the hose. My face was stinging. I called poison control- they said sour cream. I glopped it all over the affected areas and the pain stopped.
