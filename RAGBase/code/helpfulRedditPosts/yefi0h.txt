LPT: If you're asking a favor from someone you don't regularly speak to, ask the favor and AFTER that check-in on how they're doing.

content:
Whenever someone asked favors of me, if they checked in on me and then asked the favor, the conversation ended there - it felt like the sole purpose of the person reaching out was for the favor lol. Which was probably the case, and it's completely fine but from an evolutionary perspective, subconsciously, the human mind has a tendency to register and focus on the negative.

But when it's happened the other way around, where people asked the favor then stuck around to check in/have a small conversation with me, it honestly felt nicer :)

I know it seems like a formality in both cases and there's not a huge difference between the former and the latter, but I feel there is a difference all the same. And I think that difference matters :)
