YSK items with food waste on them will not be recycled and instead just end up on landfill. This includes pizza boxes due to the remaining grease. If you want to help the environment by recycling you have to clean the items before recycling otherwise you might as well put them straight in the bin.

A lot of recyclable material isnt recycled due to food contamination that is easily preventable with a quick rinse. With pizza boxes they may as well go straight into the bin. Alternatively, you could tear the top off and just recycle that as usually only the bottom is contaminated with grease. 

Plastic bags should also not be recycled as they often get stuck in the machinery causing a lot of damage and resources to repair or replace.
