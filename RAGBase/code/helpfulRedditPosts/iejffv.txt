title:
YSK that if you or someone you know has a child with a disability that prevents them from being able to advocate for themselves the parents should begin to apply for guardianship well before the child turns 18.

content:
Our son has nonverbal autism, and he is unable to advocate for himself. He is now 24, and we have been his legal guardians since he turned 18. If we didn't, we would have no say in his medical care, which is obviously vital. It also enabled us to oversee his finances. Check into guardianship with your county government at least 6 months prior to the child's 18th birthday. If the child is in that place to begin with, it is likely they already gave a county caseworker or social worker.
