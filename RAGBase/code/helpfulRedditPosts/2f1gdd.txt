YSK how to properly button a men's suit. Never fasten the bottom button.

content:
Cardinal rule of formal wear yet I see more and more men breaking it on the streets, at weddings, even celebrities on the red carpets. It may be an active form of self expression but suits are tailored with the assumption that that button will never be fastened. The material doesn't drape properly when the bottom button is done up. Does not matter if it's a two button or three button jacket; leave the bottom button undone!
