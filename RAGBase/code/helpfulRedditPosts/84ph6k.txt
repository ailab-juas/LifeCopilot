YSK that hairs and threads can wrap around toes, fingers and appendages of babies resulting in loss of that appendage.

This is called a [Hair/Thread Tourniquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_tourniquet) and can cause loss of that appendage.  I saw a case of this in the hospital today where a 6 month old may lose his toe because of it.  A long hair or a thread from the PJ's can wrap around the toe and block off the blood flow, and can happen overnight.  In boys, this occurs around the penis about 44% of the time and around toes 40%.  This can also happen around fingers, ears, labia and the tongue.  So, before putting on the full PJ's or before putting on that diaper, make sure the baby is free of any long hair in which this might occur.
