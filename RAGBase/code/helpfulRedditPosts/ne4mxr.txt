title:
YSK: Ticks, Lyme’s Disease Awareness

content:
Why YSK: May is Lyme disease awareness month. And you don’t need to go walking in high grass to get in contact with ticks, though it does increase your chances. Deer ticks are one of the most common causes of Lyme Disease. If you have a tick attached to you, do the following.
Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible. Or a tick key they’re cheap enough.
Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don’t twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal.
After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water.
Do Not crush ticks! They carry disease that when exposed can enter the body through broken skin. If you want to dispose the tick you can either put it between a piece of scotch tape (they can’t break through), put it in a tight sealed bag or container or you can wrap it in toilet paper and flush it down the toilet. The tell tale sign of a deer tick bite is the bulls eye rash. Go see your doctor if you suspect you got bit. Lyme disease does not go away. It can become dormant and you can get flare ups. Be safe and use bug spray with Deet to cut down chances.

EDIT: I correct some spelling errors. I can not change the title. I also corrected the rash type.

Thank you for the awards.
