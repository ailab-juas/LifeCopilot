title:
YSK any bank or credit charge titled "GOOGLE MOUNTAIN VIEWCAUS" is fraudulent!

content:
Why ysk. Today I was charged 400 dollars by the above title and had no idea what is was. After googling it I found literally hundreds of people who all said the same this. It was fraud. Charges ranged from a few dollars to 1500 dollars. 

If you ever see any Charge from GOOGLE  MOUNTAIN VIEWCAU or any variation of it call your bank or credit company immediately to cancel your card and dispute the charge. 

Left unchecked these fraudsters will continue to charge your card.

Edit:  To be clear. I am not blaming Google or saying Google is defrauding me. These charges are made to look like legitimate Google transactions. I misspoke when I said the title by itself is fraud. Pay attention to the wording and or if there's random numbers/letters associated with the name of the charge. If you purchase through Google regularly you can clearly see the difference between a legitimate Google transaction and a charge made to look like one.
