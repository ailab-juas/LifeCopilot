LPT: Keep toilet paper, a water bottle, and a cheap pre-payed cell phone in your car.

Find yourself in a poop emergency on a long trip with no rest stops ahead? Good thing Hamstertoast reminded you to put that toilet paper in the trunk. Car broke down! Shit! Good thing I have this water to drink, or if I ran out of anti-freeze I can replace it with water to pull over somewhere really quick.

Ass! my appendix is about to explode and I forgot my cell phone! Good thing I have Nokia in the bak to call the hospital!
