LPT: Go shopping at thrift stores in WEALTHY AREAS to find very nice second hand clothing

content:
Growing up in a rural area I always hated thrift stores cause all they had was worn out clothes that smelled like old people and moths.

Now I attend University in one of the richest areas in the United States. I have been able to find brand new designer clothing with the tags still on for very cheap. Recently I needed to show up to a job interview in business professional attire. I went to the mall and a Calvin Klein suit would’ve cost north of $1k. Instead I was able to get a 100% wool Calvin Klein suit, dress shirt, and dress shoes all in great shape for less than $20 at Goodwill. I’ve also been able to find a brand new pair of converse sneakers for $5, a Columbia coat for $10, and there have been many other great items that I passed up. I now strictly go to thrift stores when I need new clothes.
