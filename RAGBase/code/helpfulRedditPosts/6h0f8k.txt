YSK: When Googling for a customer service phone number, do not always rely on Google's snippets.

content:
For example, search for "Skype customer service". The first result will be a snippet that gives a phone number. If you'll notice, the phone number is sourced from a Facebook question. This number is a scam number, and my family member only caught on when the person on the other end asked to be sent $120 as a processing fee. 

(Feel free to give them a call and waste their time if you would like. It's the 1-844 number. I've reported them to Google, but who knows how long it will take to bring down)
