LPT: When going to a big event with a large group of people, if possible, try to book two rows of seats rather than just one really long row.

It's awesome being able to sit together with all of your friends for X event, but you can really only interact with people in your immediate vicinity. The people on the ends can't really talk to each other without shouting over 5 people.

Splitting up your group into 2 rows would make for a better experience. Not always possible if you are late to get tickets though. Then you get what you can.
