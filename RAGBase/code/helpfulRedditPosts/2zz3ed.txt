title:
LPT: Trying to sneak through your house at night? Walk near furniture.

content:
I don't know why this is just now occurring to me, but walking close to furniture whole sneaking through the house at night reduces squeaks and creaks. The floor is already weighed down near the furniture so it can't move much causing loud floor sounds.

Edit: Y'all are some clumsy people.
