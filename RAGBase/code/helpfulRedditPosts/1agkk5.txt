LPT: Young and desperate to become more social? Get a job in a service based industry.

content:
This is a strange LTP, but recently I started working part time at a large retail store that serves a very large number of customers on a daily basis and it has truly changed the way I view and interact with everyone. I used to be very introverted, and didnt really have a problem with being that way. I despised small talk and large groups, which often posed as a problem because that is how *most* people start to build relationships.

Anyway, 3 weeks after starting the job, I feel so confident approaching anyone and actually want to do it. This part of the job has proved to be more valuable than the paycheck and I thought I would pass it on.
