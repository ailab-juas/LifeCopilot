LPT: When a cat shows you its belly, pet around the cheeks and not the belly itself. Cats show their belly as a sign of trust, so going for their belly is seen as an immediate violation of that trust and may result in biting or scratching.

If your cat has shown in the past that it likes belly rubs, that's an exception of course, but the average kitty just wants you to know that you are trusted by exposing its most vulnerable area to you.
