LPT: Address your friends by their names when new people join your group

content:
So you're new in a group and can barely keep two new names in your head at a time, let alone a dozen. Does it feel familiar?

New family drops by the neighborhood bbq, don't remember half the people they've met and haven't met half the people there? Someone brings a new friend to board game night? new guy's first week at the job? Exchange student staying with your family? You know everyone already, help the new folks out!

It keeps them from having to ask for people's names or embarrass themselves by introducing themselves to the same guy three times over the course of one day. Instead, they can just listen for someone to remind them of that person's name, and start connecting their face to the name and vice versa.

This is sort of a reverse LPT in that it's more helpful for others than for you, but with any luck, people can use this when you're new somewhere. Besides, the more familiar they are with your group, the sooner you'll get to know them too.

(this might count as common courtesy, but it's something that can seem surprisingly uncommon when you're the new guy)
