Most people already know this and please delete if it’s already been here, but there’s a hotline called crisis text line that lets you text and talk about anything.

You can ask for resources for anything you need as well. If you just want to vent, if you’re feeling suicidal, or you just had a super bad day. They’re there 24/7.

If you need to speak with a female counselor for gender based trauma, just request one.

Just text Hello to 741741 :) 

(I’m a counselor and I find myself referring a lot of people to this hotline!)

Edit to answer some common questions: this is the American number. It’s not quite international but there’s similar hotlines for other countries.

They do not report suicidal ideation. They will work with you 100% if you’re feeling suicidal and the very last thing they want to do is call the police. If you are immediately at danger or killing your self and you’re not willing to work or even try to talk about it or work on ways to stay safe, they MIGHT report.

The counselors can’t see your number. They see an anonymous string of numbers. They can’t see any of your information, in fact. Only supervisors can. They do nothing with the information unless a report needs to be made.

Yes, counselors can see their own private conversation history. However they can not see everyone’s so only you and your counselor have access to what you said.

Lastly, it’s volunteer run! When it gets late - a lot of people are sad, but also sleep. There’s less volunteers online and more people texting in, hence long waiting times.
