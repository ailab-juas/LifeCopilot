title:
LPT: parents of teens, give your child an innocuous sounding phrase to text you as a code for “get me out of here” when they want to avoid peer pressure but not look like they are bailing/lame

content:
For example, ours involves our son texting asking if our dog is okay. Then we can come get him and tell him he *needs* to get home. Parents look lame, not the kid.

Edit: whoa, thanks for all the coins and constructive comments and everything!! Never slept through a FP post before!

Couple of generic replies to the more common replies:

- to “why do you need a coded text, nobody else will see it?” - have you never ever had someone looking over your shoulder before? Or you hand your phone to someone for a different use and a text comes in? Etc 

- to “don’t teach your kids to be lame, they should stand up to peer pressure” - yes, they should, and that is in fact how we roll. And sometimes it’s really goddamn hard and if they need a backup, they have one.  And considering how tough teenage life is these days, I don’t exactly think it’s teaching them anything other than “I have a parent who cares about my being and might just understand what I have to go through”...
