LPT: Everytime you cancel a monthly expense (like cable), send the money saved automatically to your savings account instead.

I learnt this "trick" from my mom: Everytime you cancel a monthly expense, because you don't need it anymore, set up a standing order and send the money to your savings account. E.g. I canceled my netflix subscription this month, because I don't really watch it anymore. Instead of just have more spending money, I set up a standing order to my savings account.
