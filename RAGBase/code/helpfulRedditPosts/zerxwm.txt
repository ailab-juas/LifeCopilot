YSK: If someone doesn’t want to dance you should just leave them alone rather than try and force them

Why YSK: not dancing in public situations often leads people to try and force you to partake and getting angry when you refuse to. People that don’t dance often don’t just need to try it and trying to force them will just lead to n uncomfortable situation for all parties

I am personally beat deaf. I am incapable of dancing, beating my head, or even tapping my fingers in response to a beat. Dancing feels like nothing to me and I have no ability to coordinate my movements in response to music. You’d be surprised just how much this stands out and distracts people after a few minutes of looking at me people will often literally stop and stare because it’s so different than anything that resembles dancing. 

While beat deafness is rare plenty of people are too shy or just don’t want to dance and if someone really doesn’t wanna dance stop making them uncomfortable and trying to force them. 

I can’t count the amount of times people have physically pulled me on the dance floor only to get furious when I refuse.
