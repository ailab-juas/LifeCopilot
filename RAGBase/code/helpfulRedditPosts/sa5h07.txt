LPT: Don't use your favorite song as a ringtone, trust me.

content:
For the last 2 years I had my favorite song from my favorite tv show set as my ringtone, and let me tell you after a while the song started to get annoying, I started to associate it to my phone ringing instead of my favorite tv show, now every time I hear the song I get that weird phone call feeling. 

Needless to say I changed my ringtone to the basic phone ringing soundtrack that already came with the phone. Lesson learned and I hope this Tip will help others.
