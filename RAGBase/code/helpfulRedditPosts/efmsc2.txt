LPT: want to be the best gift giver in your family? Start a notes file on your phone and whenever a family member or friend mentions something theyâ€™d like/need or think is cool during the year, write it down under their name. Now whenever a holiday comes up you have a list of items to choose from.

The beautiful part of this is that it takes almost no effort and saves a lot of time.  You also never again have to worry about the gift being liked or needed.
