title:
LPT: revitalize a dead ball point pen by hitting it with a lighter on the tip, then scribble.

content:
Just a quick pass with a lighter over the ball point tip melts away dried ink and frees the ball to let it write again. I feel like this works a lot more consistently than licking the tip. That one has only worked about half the time for me.

Edit: For clarity's sake, apply flame to pen tip for half a second. Then scribble. That is all.
