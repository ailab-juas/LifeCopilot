LPT: A healthy you is always better than a richer you. If you have the chance to choose mental/physical health over a better paycheck, choose to pursue health. You will never regret it!

Maybe this belongs in a different sub, but I found this out the hard way. I used to have such a dysfunctional work environment that the stress and anxiety would follow me home and (though I wouldnt call myself suicidal) I would fantasize death as a form of escape.

I thought I was alone, and I thought I wouldn’t be able to support my family if I changed jobs.

I eventually sought a different position - one that makes $1,000 less per month, but entails a better work environment/lifestyle and habits - and after some counseling, I can finally say I can enjoy my life again!

I’m happy.
My wife is happy.
That makes my kids happier.
We can enjoy the time we have together.

I’d rather look for creative ways to make ends meet than sit at home worrying about work and wishing I was dead. And in the end, it’s the time we have together that matters.

Anyways, I just want to tell you from experience that if your work life is unhealthy, the leap of faith will ALWAYS be worth it! Pursue health fiercely. You will NEVER look back and wish you had the cash instead.

Edit: I realize that not everyone has the privilege of getting to make this choice - but if you’re out there and youre suffering from abuse or mental health issues from your place of work, this post is for you.
