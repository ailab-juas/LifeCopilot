LPT: When you are preparing a frozen pizza, cut it into slices while still frozen. You can still easily use a normal pizza cutter, or cut it with a knife, or even break it apart with your hands, all without any red saucy mess. You'll also get better heat distribution, and avoid cold centers.

Edit 1: To the people shitting on eating frozen pizzas in general: why don't you try working 14 hours a day on your feet the whole time and then see how much energy you have to cook a good meal with the remaining few hours you have before bed.

Edit 2: this worked well for the pizza I used, but brands vary widely in their ingredients, crusts style, and proportion, so the success of this LPT will probably depend largely on brand. 

Also it's not like it's extremely difficult to cook and cleanup after a frozen pizza, but this LPT makes those small inconveniences a little more convenient. Nobody is having a huge problem with this task, as many people seem to think.
