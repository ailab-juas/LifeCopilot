title:
LPT: don’t pay the “Lady Tax,” Buy a beard trimmer for your body hair

content:
This is especially targeted at women who wouldn’t normally already have a beard trimmer. Don’t buy an expensive “bikini trimmer”! It does the same thing as a beard trimmer! I bought a beard trimmer for my pubes last week…it cost 14.99, while the “lady trimmer” cost 44.99. Same thing goes for any product that both men and women use…unless it’s important for some reason to get the “female version,” don’t pass up on the men’s products- they’re often cheaper!
