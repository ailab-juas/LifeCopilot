LPT: Never say anything at work that you wouldn't want read out loud at a deposition.

content:
Your coworkers can feel like friends, but there will always be someone ready to stab you in the back. HR doesn't care about context. They don't care if you were joking around with your coworker when someone overheard you, or if you were obviously joking when you said you wanted to kill Karen from accounting.

ITT: People who have been burned for being too open at work, and people who think I’m miserable and cynical because they haven’t been burned yet.
