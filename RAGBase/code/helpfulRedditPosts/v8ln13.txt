LPT: When you realize you're being scammed, don't tell the scammer how you know

content:
More of a tip to help the next person. It's so tempting to tell the scammer why you know they're trying to rip you off, but that would only serve to help them refine their story to trick the next person

Edit: don't say this:  "Ah ha! I knew that was too cheap to be real" 

or 

"Oh yeah? You take money transfers from every app except for PayPal which actually has buyer protection?!"

Edit 2: I guess I'm thinking more small scale local scammers who you contact on FB marketplace or something rather than large scale spam callers from overseas
