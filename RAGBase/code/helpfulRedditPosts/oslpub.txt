LPT: When you buy a new WiFi router don’t login into the new network on all your devices; Changed the new router’s SSID and password to match the old one and everything will just work.

I set both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz to the same name and let the device choose which it prefers. Mileage may vary on older routers. 

Also, set your ~~5Ghz~~ 2.4Ghz to NOT support 802.11b since it will slow down the network. 

Edit: as others have pointed out, it should be the 2.4Ghz protocol that you’d configure to disallow 802.11b.
