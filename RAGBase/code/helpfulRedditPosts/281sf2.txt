LPT: If after financing a car and driving it off the lot, the dealer calls you and tells you the financing fell through and you have to sign a new contract/put more money down, it's a scam solely designed to squeeze more money out of you.

content:
Don't ever sign a new contract or give the dealer back your keys without receiving your down payment (including taxes) or trade in back first. You have two options at this point, either stand firm and tell the you wont sign ANYTHING that is different than the contract you originally agreed upon. If they wont budge demand all of your down payment back. If they refuse, have them contact your lawyer but DON'T give them the keys until they've given you back all of the money owed you.
