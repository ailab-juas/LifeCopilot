LPT: If you’re anxious about seeing a comedy act (because you don’t want to be part of the show) ask the staff at where to sit; they know which parts of the audience can be seen by the stage.

When I worked at a comedy club, I would have friends tell me they’d never seen a live comedy show because of anxiety that the comedian will talk to them or include them in the show. It’s pretty common for a comic to chat to one or two people during a show and the audience will turn in their direction, so I can understand how that attention can cause anxiety. 

In most cases the comedian on stage can only see the first several rows of tables or chairs and there are a lot of seats that still have good views but the comedian can’t see you well enough to talk to you because of the direction a stage light is coming from. 

Similarly, if you *do* want the comic to be more likely to interact with you, the staff can help you with that also. There may be tables that look close to the stage but the comedian can’t see them due to lighting.

ETA: The vast majority of comedians are really good about telling whether or not you’re comfortable being a part of their show, and they will move on to someone else if you don’t want to engage. Comedians want their audience to have a good time. But some folks do not want even the attention of the *first* question. This post is for those people!
