LPT: try giving away your “trash”. Construction materials, furniture, and bulky items likely have value to someone else

content:
We tore our deck out, I listed the half rotted wood (but still some good pieces) on FB marketplace for free before paying to dump it. Was gone in two days. (Lady was building a chicken coop)

Today, after a whole 2 hours on FB marketplace, someone came and picked up an exterior door I removed yesterday that was in poor shape. He needed it for a garden shed. 

Years ago, we got rid of a couch that was (literally) falling apart. Family had puppies that wanted to train before getting a newer couch. 

All these examples would have cost money to dispose of properly. A simple listing for free got them gone…and quick!

It is true you could try to sell items you don’t need anymore, and that’s nothing novel, but my point is truly one man’s trash can be another man’s treasure…and these items were trash to me. Technology has opened up this avenue for upcycling, recycling, and reusing like never before. Try giving it away and you might be surprised!
