A way to increase your happiness, day by day.

My first post, so i hope this is the right place to post it:

I would like to tell you about a way that can increase your happiness, day by day.
For a long time, i have been feeling unhappy about my life. 
However, i recently decided that it was time to turn the unhappiness, into happiness.

The tools i used for this was a pen and a block of paper.
Every night, before going to sleep, i sit down by my bed table, and i write down the good things that have happened to me during the day.
I have started writing down even the smallest event, as long as they made me feel happy, or good about myself.

An example: 
2. March 2013
- Played the guitar again
- Had a pizza with my good friend
- Had a good talk with mom on the phone

You can put down as many things on the list as you'd like.
However there might be days where you feel unhappy, and you dont feel that you have anything to write at all.
Whenever this happens, read the list of good things you have written so far.
By every day there will be more added to the list, and there will be more good things to help you cheer up again.
Be careful that it doesnt just turn into a diary. Write only the things that made you feel happy and good about yourself.

I have been doing this for 3 months now, and it has made me a lot happier, and helped me when i was feeling down.
I hope that this can be a tool to help any of you that feel unhappy, to become happier.
