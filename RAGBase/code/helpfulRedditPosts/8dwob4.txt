YSK at Universities in the United States one "credit hour" = one hour of lecture AND two hours of independent work per week (or three hours of lab work)

content:
This makes a 15 credit hour semester a 45 hour time commitment per week. I was told "student" was a full time job by a professor in my first year, but I was never told that this was a standard definition that courses are designed around. Students who meet this standard every week tend to do very well.
