YSK: If your partner has an insecurity that you believe does not have any real basis, reinforce the opposite instead of invalidating their emotions.

content:
Simply put, if your partner says, "I think I'm getting fat", don't say, "That's not true! You're just seeing things!". Instead, work on reinforcing the opposite, like random compliments like  "You're looking so slim today. Have you been working out?"
It's a basic rule that people don't usually follow. Invalidating your partner doesn't just not ease their mind, but it makes them trust you less.
This applies for more serious insecurities, it's just really easy to explain with this example.
