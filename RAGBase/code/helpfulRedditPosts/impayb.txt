LPT: wear a helmet. I know many kids and adults think they’re stupid. Be really smart and look stupid in helmets. Brain damage is no joke.

content:
My son hit his head almost 8 weeks ago. He had a concussion, broken skull, and brain bleed. He’s now admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility for suicidal tendencies. He’s 12. You don’t want to go through this.

Edit: I can’t thank you all enough for sending so many kinds words our way. He is getting the best care we could find, and is expected to recover. We are proud of him for being open to help. But please, protect your brain.

Edit 2: I’m sorry I can’t answer all the questions directly. He fell off a golf cart actually. One wouldn’t think he would need one on it, but I’ve learned when in doubt wear one. He was mentally stable before the accident. And we have no idea how he is doing. We can’t even visit him in the hospital due to Covid. Please protect those you love.

Edit 3, a month later: For those who may still see this and are curious, he is doing marvelous now. He still has a road to recovery, but my son is himself again.
