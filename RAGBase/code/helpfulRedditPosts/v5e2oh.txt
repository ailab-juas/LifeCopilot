title:
YSK if someone doesn’t drink alcohol. Don’t ask them why or pressure them to drink.

It took me much longer to figure this out then it should have. 

Why YSK the people that I’ve encountered that don’t drink have a good personal reason why they don’t. In my experience the most common reason is that one of their family members was an alcoholic. 

It’s probably best not to bring that up when talking about how much “fun” drinking is. 

Bonus YSK you shouldn’t be pressuring people into doing anything they don’t want to.
