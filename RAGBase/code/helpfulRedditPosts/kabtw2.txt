title:
YSK that Survivorman's entire series is available on youtube for free. The series films an expert living in actual survival situations for seven days where he has to find his own way out. If you are an outdoors person or you travel the show teaches very valuable concepts that could save your life.

I'd also like to note that **none of it is simulated.** He starts off with equipment your average day hiker might start off with and heavy cameras - he records everything himself. It's not a game show like Survivor or completely staged like Bear Grylls show. It's real, he survives alone and uses practical skills to do so.

Why YSK: [The show has saved multiple lives](https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2008/04/04/tv_reality_show_saved_my_life_snowmobiler_says.html) so while it is not only entertaining, it's educational with practical skills. Certainly not everyone, not even close to it, will need to use these skills to survive, it's better to know how to do something to survive and not need it than to end up in that kind of situation and be completely helpless.

His channel also has other survival related content that might be interesting to some people.

Whether you are a /r/cordcutter or just /r/poor, youtube guides like these are not only entertaining, but they can save your life.

*Note: I am in no way affiliated with the show Survivorman or any other television show or publisher. I just like survival shows and getting free TV.*
