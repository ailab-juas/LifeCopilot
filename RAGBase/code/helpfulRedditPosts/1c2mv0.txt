LPT: How to get rid of a Hickey.

content:
I am not sure if this has been posted before, but I found this out this year!  All one has to do is take a silver spoon, run it under cold water (like at a sink faucet), and then take the cold spoon and massage it over the hickey gently for about 5-10 mins.  This should work, or make the hickey not as noticeable.  Good luck!  hope it helps!
