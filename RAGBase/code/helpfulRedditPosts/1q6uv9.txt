LPT: If you're buying something online, don't purchase right away! Leave your item on the checkout page for a few hours - you're more likely to get a discount.

I was shopping online, and was about to buy something that was more expensive than I would have liked it to be (one of [these](http://www.ashleybridget.com/collections/magic-collection), if you care). I filled out my contact information on the first page, but didn't fill out my credit card information, as I was still mulling over my purchase. 

I drifted away from the page for a couple of hours, only to receive [an email](http://imgur.com/ABZL1RL) from the site stating: "I noticed you left your Ashley Bridget accessory on the shelf today. I went on a whim and created a voucher code for you to receive 65% off your entire order that is valid for one time use."

The next day, when I decided to make my purchase, I noticed that the specific item was on sale as well. I ended up paying $19.95 (free shipping on my order) for 3 items that were each $48.00 to start. 

Sharing my story with friends, I found out that apparently a lot of sites will offer discount codes if they think you're on the fence about a purchase. So don't be too decisive!
