LPT: If someone flashes their lights at you, there is something bad ahead. Usually animals crossing or police.

content:
Born and raised in GA. Just had a friend driving that didn't know what it meant. We saw a cop with his lights off shortly after. If my friend didn't know, someone else doesn't know. Stay safe!

Edit: It might also mean your head lights are off, or your brights are on.
