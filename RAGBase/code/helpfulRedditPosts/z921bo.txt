LPT: With winter coming, if you're new to cold weather or cold climates, you should learn how to layer your clothes. Layering properly is much more effective than buying a large, bulky coat or relying on a single "warm" item to keep you comfortable.

Layering clothing is essential for cold climates. With proper layering you can comfortably operate in a range of temperatures as you can add or remove layers if you get hot or cold throughout the day.

Basically, you should approach layering as a function of threes.

1. **Base layer.** A base layer is the one that is against your skin. A good base layer provides moisture (sweat) wicking materials while being thin enough to allow you to add layers above it. Merino wool socks, long underwear, and a long sleeve moisture wicking shirt are good for base layering.
2. **Middle Layer.** A middle layer is the insulation. It allows your body to keep warm air against your skin so you function as your own heater without letting too much warm air escape. A fleece zipped top can be effective here, for example.
3. **Outer layer.** Outer layers are designed to stop the wind from taking away that blanket of warm air your body made and your middle layer is keeping close, as well as provide moisture protection (rain and snow). They should be easily removable so you can de-layer as you heat up. Wind or rain resistant outer shells along with hats, gloves, and moisture resistant footwear can be used here.

**Layering/Delayering.** As the day goes on you may have to remove layers or add them back on. If, for example, you start your day in the dark and it's windy, but later you're out in the sun and the wind dies down, you may find yourself getting warmer. Taking a layer or two off to keep yourself from sweating is important. (If you're sweating in the cold this can quickly lead to frostbite.) If the wind picks back up, you stop being active, or it becomes cloudy, adding layers back will help you warm up again.

You can also layer for hot weather, rainy weather, or variable weather using different materials and articles of clothing. Planning ahead and having the right elements before you go into the environment will go a long way in keeping you warm, comfortable, and safe.
