This could be useful if anyone has small children who are being cooped up, or if you just want a happy escape from the bad news on TV.  I hope everyone is staying safe out there!

Required Edit: I’m so glad so many people are finding the good in this post! And the awards are lovely. In honor of everyone who has made this post as wholesome as it is, I’ve made a $20 donation to the Atlanta Giving Kitchen, an organization that’s helping service industry workers during the outbreak. Thanks to everyone for being so kind to each other, remember to wash your hands and don’t touch your face, and be excellent to one another.
