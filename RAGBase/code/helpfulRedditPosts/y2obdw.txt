title:
YSK - when making eft money transfers online

content:
YSK - we only receive the money and whatever you have written in the “reference” section.  Nothing else.  I have money sitting in my banking with references like “transfer” or “equip hire.”  I have over 600 customers with equipment on hire from me.  No idea who this money belongs to.

Why YSK - I am going to chase you for non-payment and then make you send me your bank statements to prove this money is yours.  It’s a lot of extra work for both of us. 

Please use an invoice number or even your customer name.
