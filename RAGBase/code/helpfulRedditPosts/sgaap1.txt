LPT: For first time home buyers and apartment dwellers, used furniture and dishes are your friend when you're on a budget and need to stock your house.

content:
When you get your first place and are low on cash, avoid being tempted to use a credit card or a loan for furniture if possible. You can furnish a small house or apartment for around $500 with a bit of time and effort. When I bought my first a few years ago, all I had was a bed and a chair and managed to do it quite easily. 

I used sources like ReStore (habitat for humanity), Facebook marketplace, etc to find used furniture on the cheap in very good condition and, in some cases, old and well constructed (read: heavy). A coat of paint can give some character.

Most of it did not match, but the house had functional and comfortable furniture that I later gave away or sold as I upgraded. 

Goodwill is fantastic for finding dishes and glassware as well. 

Some examples of what I bought (from memory):

-All steel office desk (commercial): $25

-Commercial hardwood waiting room chair that worked at the desk until I could upgrade: $5

-Various hardwood side tables and night stands: $10-15 each

-Various Lamps: $5 each

-Very nice entertainment center for tv: $50. I splurged on this one off of marketplace because it was essentially new. I still have it 8 years later.

-Large array of glassware (tea glasses, highball, coffee mugs, etc: $10 total
New sets are relatively cheap from places like Walmart nowadays but figured I'd throw it in there.

-Awesome old school stereo/record console (I have a good bit of old vinyl): $25

-Clothes washer with leaking water pump: $75, water pump: $25

-Clothes dryer: $100 but have seen them for around $75.

-Couches: &lt;$100 all day on market place. They may be ugly with some old patterned upholstery, but old couches generally hold up well.

-Various chairs for dining table: $10-15 each when not a part of a set.

-Kitchen table: $30+ a coat of stain.

-Coffee table: $25

ReStore also has quite a bit of salvaged building materials. Last time I was in one few months ago, they had at least 20 hardwood exterior doors for around $30, various indoor doors for $15-20, various vinyl windows for $15-20 each, etc.
