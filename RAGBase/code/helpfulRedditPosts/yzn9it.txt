LPT: Time to start the turkey thaw process

content:
 If you have a frozen turkey for thanksgiving, now is the time to plan  the refrigerator thaw.  At 1 day per 4-5lbs your 20lb ones should be  going from freezer to fridge today.  Make sure to put in near the  bottom, double bag it, and put it in a container that will catch all the  juice so you don't ruin your fridge.
