LPT: Clean your car before going to a job interview. Some potential employers may walk you out and will judge you on on your vehicles appearance.

Years ago I got hired for this. He said I seemed organized and asked me if I could start the following Monday.

Edit: You can own a beater that you never clean thats filled with trash or you can own a beater that you vacuum occasionally and throw the trash away. How you take care of your stuff says a lot about you.
