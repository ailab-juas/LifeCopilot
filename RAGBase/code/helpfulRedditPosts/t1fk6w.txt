LPT: If you find yourself in a poor country and doing some haggling "for the experience", remember that $1 means a lot more to the vendor than it does to you.

content:
You may enjoy the feeling of getting a good bargain, but that feeling ends when you agree a price. The reality is that the extra % you haggle off will mean a lot more to the vendor than it does to you. Put your hand in your pocket and surprise them with more than the starting price. The surprise on their face will make a better memory than the haggling experience.

Edit required due to the nature of the comments:

Rule 1: obviously don't pay more than you would do in your home country. Apparently that needs to be stated.

Rule 2: Don't be an asshole, consider that something completely trivial in your life could actually help someone else.
