YSK having a garbage bin in your guest bathroom can save your female visitors from a lot of discomfort.

content:
I have noticed that many of my male friends who are either gay or single don't have garbage bins in their half bathrooms. This can make it very awkward for a female on their period. Either they have to try and wrap up feminine hygiene products in toilet paper and carry it around your house searching for another garbage or awkwardly stash it in their purse. It's 20 times more awkward if this happens during a party when you have a lot of people around. I've also had this problem before when visiting older women who don't need a garbage can for their own personal use anymore so men aren't the only culprits. So please consider that your guests might actually need and appreciate a small garbage can in the toilet area.
