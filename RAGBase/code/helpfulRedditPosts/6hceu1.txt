LPT: When shopping for apartments and houses visit the location at night time before signing.

content:
My girlfriend and I were planning on signing a lease tomorrow at a beautiful apartment unit right next to a retention pond. Its perfect in the daytime but we went to show her parents tonight and the pond was full of bullfrogs. It is UNBEARABLY loud. And these are really expensive apartments also with good insulation. We are going to talk to them tomorrow and sign a different unit farther up the road that we saw.
