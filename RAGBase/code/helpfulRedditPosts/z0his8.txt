title:
LPT: A promotion delayed is a promotion denied

content:
Originally an MLK quote about justice, but I think it applies here as well. If you are good at a position in your company and especially if you are an outperformer in your department, many companies will know they need you but avoid moving you or giving your a promotion because you are indispensable to your current position. They will string you along for years (yes, years) with vague promises of future promotions, but they will delay it indefinitely often using excuses like other people quitting or not having someone to replace you. You should take this as a "no."  


This is not to say that you should immediately quit, a sure paycheck is a valuable asset and you should stay with your company for as long as you need them until you have something concrete in place, but start submitting resumes other places and take interviews. A lot of times you will even get an offer, submit a two weeks notice at your current place, and your current company may give you a counteroffer with an actual promotion because you have given them an ultimatum and they want to keep you, after which you may reconsider. But either way, if they don't say yes, they said no, and you should never take them at their word for vague promises of future promotions/raises.
