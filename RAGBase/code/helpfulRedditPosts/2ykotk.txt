LPT: Duracell will replace or repair items that have been damaged by battery defects.

content:
As long as you're using Duracell branded batteries don't toss out damaged items if the battery leaks.
Mail the damaged product with the batteries still inside and Duracell will repair or replace the item!

Edit: I don't work for Duracell - I'm pretty sure telling folks to send them their broken stuff for a reimbursement or repair probably isn't in their best interest!! My husband told me this bit of info but I didn't realize he meant ALL major brands.
