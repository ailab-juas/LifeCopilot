YSK: If everyone in your household, including the family pet, suddenly develop flu-like symptoms at the same time, you may be experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning

content:
Why YSK: Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas caused by the incomplete combustion of fuel. CO poisoning results in over 20,000 emergency department visits and over 400 deaths per year in the US. 

Symptoms may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion.

Animals often develop symptoms earlier than people, which is why coal miners used to bring a canary with them into mines. Symptoms in animals may include anxiety, aggression, fatigue and vomiting.

If you think you might be experiencing CO poisoning get to fresh air immediately and seek medical attention.
