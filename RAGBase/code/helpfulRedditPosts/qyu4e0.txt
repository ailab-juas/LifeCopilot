LPT: HR can't be on your side unless you make them

content:
Hey, everyone. HR worker here, and I hope everyone can benefit from this.

By definition, Human Resources is there to protect the company from lawsuits, not to help the employees. 

As much as we HR people want to help you and protect the worker, it'll cost us our jobs if we put you over the company. So the best tip I can give you is this:

Don't ask HR for help. Make them.

Get evidence. Document interactions. Get things in writing. The more you have as proof of whatever your complaint is, the more HR will have to help you. If you show them you have proof that will support a lawsuit, they will do everything they can to make sure it doesn't need to happen, and the easier it is for us to justify it to our bosses. 

Help us help you.

Edit: Please stop calling me a heartless, soulless monster who will fire people to keep my job. I *lost* my last job because I stood up for my colleagues. All I'm trying to say is that, in this economy, your HR rep can't always afford to stake their job for you, and you shouldn't go into an HR meeting expecting them to.
