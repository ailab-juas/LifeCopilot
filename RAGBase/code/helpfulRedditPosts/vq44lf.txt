YSK: Safety Razors Are the Cheapest and Best Way to Shave.

content:
 Why YSK: You can buy a safety razor that uses disposable razors for 15$. The disposable razors cost 10$ for 100. This means you're paying 10 cents per super close shave. All of this is available at Walmart or Amazon. I won't post any links because the brand doesn't really matter, and this isn't an advertisement.
