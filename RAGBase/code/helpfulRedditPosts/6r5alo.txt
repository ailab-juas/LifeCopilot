*Edit* Please don't mistake this as "just be happy" advice if you are depressed. Depression is a clinical condition that requires professional treatment. If you are depressed, please seek treatment. 

This tip is for those who were socialized into believing things and people would magically make them happy. They will not. Happiness comes from many sources, one of which is goal accomplishment. Deciding to do something, no matter how small, and doing it, is an exercise of willpower and overcoming obstacles. Even the smallest of obstacles.
