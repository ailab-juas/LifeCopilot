LPT to get to sleep if youre a little restless, clog your mind with the realization of how comfortable you are and how nice it is to be in bed.

I stumbled upon this one myself and now regularly use it to great benefit. If you find yourself laying awake at night with static thoughts or restlessness, I've found what could be a great outlet for you! When I come to this point I will just think about any recent event where I wished I was at home and in bed. The more recent the better! For me, I can usually think of at least one time during that day lol Then, think about how you are in bed, right now! You're exactly where you wished to be. Totally comfortable and under the covers. This alone does a lot of benefit for me, personally. When the thoughts don't stop coming I will focus a little more on how comfortable I really am at that exact moment. Try to push all your thoughts out with the realization of how comfortable you are. If thoughts STILL continue, I count backwards from 30 and once you reach zero, dive straight into realizing your comfortability.  Repeat if needed.

I hope this quick exercise will result in much more accumulative sleep! It really works for me even if it takes a few times. Good luck!

Edit: thank you for the rewards :) sleep well
