YSK: When signing up for interest-free financing for a product, if you don't pay that item off completely in the allotted time, ALL the accrued interest will be due as soon as the term is up

content:
YSaK that the credit card company will NOT break the monthly amount due into equal increments to safeguard you from not paying it all on time. 

For instance, you buy an 1800 dollar washer with 0% interest for 18 months. Your monthly minimum amount due will be ~$50. They won't set the monthly due amount at $100 to ensure you pay it off in time. You'll have to figure that math out yourself and be sure you pay that amount to make sure your balance is $0 come the 18th month. 

If you don't pay the 1800 off completely by the end, all that interest you would have saved gets added to the balance, making the interest-free financing useless.
