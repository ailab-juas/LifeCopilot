LPT: how I killed my procrastination problems

content:
I had a huge procrastination problem. Couldn’t do anything in my life: didn’t workout, didn’t study, couldn’t do a thing as simple as cleaning my room. But one night I thought to myself: what if I did productive stuff not for me, but for tomorrow me? Now every time I want to sit on my phone, I think to myself: would future me be happy that I did that? If not, what could I do that future me would be happy about? Been doing this for a month now, I can’t believe how much my life has changed.
