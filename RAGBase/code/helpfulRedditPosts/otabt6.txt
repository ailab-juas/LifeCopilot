title:
LPT: if and when you get painful menstrual cramps, do a wall push-up

content:
This tip was given to me by an ER nurse years ago and it still blows me away how effective this is. [We already know that exercise can be helpful for period cramps,](https://www.webmd.com/women/features/exercise-eases-menstrual-cramps) but in the moment of a bad cramp we may not have the energy or ability to just go take a jog. 

If youâ€™re at work or school and experiencing painful cramps, go to the bathroom and do 1 - 10 wall push-ups. You can do them standing up and in a small space, and they are amazingly helpful for relieving in-the-moment cramps. As someone with agonizingly painful endometriosis, this tip has saved me many times. Give it a try!
