LPT - Do not underestimate the mental health benefits of taking a half day off of work, especially in toxic overworking environments.

content:
I live and work in the Silicon Valley where there are a BUNCH of tech companies. A lot of people here are overworked and the culture really encourages it so I try and take a half day once a month (if I don’t have other vacations planned). Go into the city and treat yourself to lunch. Drive home when there’s no traffic and get some extra chill time. Get groceries/chores done when Costco isn’t busy AF. Drop some flowers/food off at the S.O’s. The options are endless. I used to be expected to work 9-10 hours a day so it would get me back 6+ hours just by using 4 PTO hours. Sometimes not doing it on a Friday gave me a nice mid week break.
