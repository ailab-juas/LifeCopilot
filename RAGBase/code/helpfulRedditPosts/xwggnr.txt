YSK the significance of recycling codes on plastics: #1 and #2 can be recycled at almost every recycling center, but #3, #6 and #7 usually cannot be recycled. Some recycling centers can process plastics labeled #4 and #5, so call your local center to see if they accept those containers.

Why YSK: Many people believe that if a plastic item has the "recycling symbol" on it then it can be recycled, which isn't true. Only 5-6% of the plastic waste generated in the US each year is recycled. 85% ends up in landfills and 10% gets incinerated. You can minimize the number of items that end up in landfills by choosing products that are easy to recycle.
