title:
YSK it's better to donate money than food to a food bank

content:
With Christmas coming up, there's going to be lots of food drives happening soon. While a food bank will gladly accept food donations, most of them prefer money for 2 main reasons.

1. You don't know what their stock is. You could be giving them something they have too much of while ignoring something else they need.


2. Most food banks have agreements with grocery stores to buy food at wholesale prices. So donating $20 will do more than going out and buying $20 worth of food.

If you have a can of beans lying around that you want to get rid of, then by all means donate it. Giving them food is still *good* but giving money is better. Plus you get a tax receipt for donating money.
