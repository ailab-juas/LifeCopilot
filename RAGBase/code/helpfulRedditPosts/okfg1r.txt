LPT: Don’t base your entire identity and self-worth off of a skill (coding, violin, soccer, etc). You will be unhappy and feel like a failure when others surpass you.

content:
My coworker who has based much of his identity at being a “coding nerd” becomes rude and defensive when anyone suggests edits and dismissively says a lot of things like “you wouldn’t understand.” Don’t be that person. 

When you remove everything in your life, what is left?
