LPT: Turn your lock down into a story. I've been pretending that I'm in an off world colony with a hostile environment so leaving the hab is dangerous. It's helped my mental health quite a bit.

content:
Leaving the hab (house) requires your pressure suit (mask) and getting food from the farms (stores) is always a dangerous enterprise. I can talk to people back on Earth with my terminal, but it's too dangerous to make the trek to go visit even other colonists. We have green zones (yards) around the hab where we don't have to wear protective gear. 

I know. It sounds dumb, but it's helping me cope with the isolation.
