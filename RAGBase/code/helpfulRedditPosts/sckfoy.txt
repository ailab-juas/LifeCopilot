LPT: Give yourself time alone in the morning to do something that you genuinely enjoy. Something not related to your job, preferably a hobby. This will start your day off with a curious mind and a happy mood.

I know this is tough for some people because of the many responsibilities we have in life, but if you're able to give yourself even an hour in the morning to yourself while doing something that genuinely brings you happiness, it's going to make the rest of your morning a bit better, maybe even the whole day.

Whatever your hobby is (the more specific, the better) spend some uninterrupted time in the morning involved with it. Ideally it's something that can easily put you into a "flow state". A "flow state" is a feeling of being completely immersed into what you're doing. Have you ever been doing something and before you know it three hours have passed? You think to yourself where has the time gone? You were probably in a flow state. For example, if you're really interested in American Civil War history, reading through the history of a battle that you were unaware of will probably put you into a flow state. 

Coming out of a flow state has great benefits in starting your day. Your brain is already active, you've already activated a curious mind, and you started your day voluntarily engaged with something that brings you happiness. 

Cheers to a flow state morning!
