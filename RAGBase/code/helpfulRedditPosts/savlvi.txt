LPT: Before you drop off your car for service, take a photo of the odometer.

I took my car to what I was told was a reputable service center.  I had taken a photo of the odometer as I dropped it off.
When I picked it up there were 300+ kms on it.
Turns out someone had taken it for quite a joy ride.
My husband told me to do this always.  Turns out it was good advice.

EDIT:  Wow thanks for the upvotes but mostly thanks for your amazing stories.  Crazy.
