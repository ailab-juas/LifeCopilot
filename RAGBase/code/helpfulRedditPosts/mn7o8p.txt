title:
[LPT] Give your parents a different name for when you want them to say NO

content:
As a kid whenever I didn't want to go somewhere with a friend I'd call my mum and say "hey mummy, can I go to XYZ's after school?". I NEVER call her mummy, always mum. 
She knew that meant to say no. Saved a lot of hassle with friends etc on days where I just wanted to go home.
Sorry for lack of clarity, can't work out a better way to phrase this

Edit: Okay I get it, you can just say no, personally this is what I did, if it's a rubbish LPT just downvote it, chill with the harsh personal message folks. Y'all never found a polite way to turn down and invite? Yes it's good to be honest but sometimes a white lie is okay. "Mum said no" rather than "Your dad smells like rotting goat milk and I'd rather rub my clit in broken glass than talk to him" ðŸ˜‚
