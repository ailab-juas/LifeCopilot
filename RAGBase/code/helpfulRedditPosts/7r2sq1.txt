LPT: If you are having trouble beginning writing something, just throw anything down and then come back and edit it.

content:
As someone who writes for a living, I use this technique almost any time I write. If I begin obsessing over the best way to start this paragraph, or the perfect way to organize text, I can never get started. If I remember I can always come back and change this later or re-organize later, I can get started instantly. What I find, is that it is then way easier to come back and edit it. Somehow, editing seems to be way easier than writing!
