LPT: when getting any kind of care at a hospital of, just be pleasant. It makes the world of a difference to the workers and after an onslaught of miserable patients, a simple bit of positivity can truly make their week

My wife works at a hospital and they are very, very, VERY busy. Healthcare workers are stressed, over worked and just hanging on. My wife came home the other night just glowing with happiness. She had a patient simply smile and say things like your guys are doing a great job’ and ‘thank you so much’ to her. It really made her week and definitely her night. Anyways, thought I would mention this as something very small can go a very long way!
