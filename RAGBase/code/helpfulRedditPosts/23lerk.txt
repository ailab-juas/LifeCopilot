LPT: Quickly gain traction in a new job

content:
Starting a new job, you're likely to know very little about your actual responsibilities and roles.  It's probably going to be 3-6 months until you actually become valuable to your boss and colleagues, and are actually going to be a hindrance to them, regularly needing help.

You need to prove your usefulness quickly, and get them on your side.

I suggest you find something that everyone hates doing and become very good at it.

In my organization, we have lots of meetings.  I quickly found that no one liked keeping notes during these, recording the attendees, important discussions, and future action items.

Though I wasn't knowledgeable in my core responsibilities yet, I became the "notes guy" who took great notes for every meeting I was in, and within a year, was being invited to meetings well above my pay grade with Directors, and VPs.

By building good will doing something that people didn't like, I was able to ask for help from others easily, and was quickly getting face time with people higher up than me.

Find the thing in your office that people don't want to do, and show that you're willing to be a team player early on.  It pays off.
