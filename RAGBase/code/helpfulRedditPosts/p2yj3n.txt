LPT: Don't tell a stranger on the phone when you will be out of town.

content:
I have worked in the service industry for years.  Part of my job is scheduling estimates, repairs, jobs, etc. for homeowners.  I call the customer and offer a date or dates for the service they need.   I cannot tell you how many times, on a daily basis, a customer will tell me when and how long they will be away from home on vacation, business, etc and that no one will be home.  You don't need to explain anything, simply tell the person that the date doesn't work for you, maybe even offer a date or dates that do work for you.  

You don't know to whom you are speaking, but chances are they already have your name and address, so don't let them know when no one will be home.  Keep yourselves and your homes safe.
