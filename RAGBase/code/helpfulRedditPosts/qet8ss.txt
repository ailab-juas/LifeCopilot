LPT: Turn off your read receipts when having your boss/coworkers phone numbers in your phone. You’re allowed a free day off without any distractions.

content:
We all have bosses that try and get us to work but the best response is no response. I hate that it has to come down to it but turning off those read receipts so they don’t know that you acknowledged their messages is a must. And if they try to call, just don’t pick up. You deserve that day off.
