LPT: When checking in more than 1 bag of luggage, split your clothes into 2 or more bags in case one gets lost.

content:
I went to Finland a few years ago and one of the bags with all my clothing including coldwear was left behind in Helsinki (took another plane to another Finn city from there) because of a strike, and I didn't have any clean clothes to change into for about 12 hours before the airline got my clothes to the hotel. From then on, my mom would split everyone's clothes into different bags so that if one gets lost, we still have some backup in other bags while we wait for the missing bag to arrive.
