YSK: In English, when referring to yourself and, lets say, a friend, you should say "my friend and I" for subjective case and "my friend and me" for objective.

Why YSK: It's a super common grammar mistake and I see people making it a lot! I remember my elementary school teacher telling us that we should always say "my friend and *I*" as opposed to "my friend and *me*," but there are instances were the latter is actually correct.

The best way to know when to say it is by thinking about whether you would say "I" or "me" when referring only to yourself in a similar sentence. Here's an example of this occurring when you and your friend are the subjects of the sentence:

**Example (my friend and I):**

"My friend and me went to the beach."*My friend* went to the beach. *Me* went to the beach.

Of course this isn't correct. You would say:

"My friend and I went to the beach."*My friend* went to the beach. *I* went to the beach.

So let's use this same principle with a different sentence, where you and your friend are the *objects*.

**Example (my friend and me)**:

"My teacher gave a test to my friend and I."My teacher gave a test to *my friend*. My teacher gave a test to *I.*

That doesn't make sense, now does it? So instead, you would say:

"My teacher gave a test to my friend and me."My teacher gave a test to *my friend*. My teacher gave a test to *me.*

Edit: oh ok this blew up that's nice! This was just a reaction to a title I saw on a different Reddit post so that's cool. Thanks to the commentors who also showed the example. I struggled with phrasing the title and hoped the example in text would clear it up but reading comments is always fun.  


Edit 2: PLATINUM!? It's grammar!! thank you very much kind stranger, me and my friends will definitely be celebrating this.
