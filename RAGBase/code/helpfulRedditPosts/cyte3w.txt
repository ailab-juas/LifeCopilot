LPT: For aging/arthritic pets, consider elevating their food and water dishes. A simple change like this can make a huge difference in their overall health and quality of life.

Edit: Always consult your vet before modifying your pet's dietary habits. Elevated food/water dishes may not make sense for all pets.

Although it may not always be obvious when watching our pets, arthritis can make eating and drinking water a painful and exhausting task for our pets, which may reduce their interest in eating and drinking water, and their appetite as a whole.

The simple act of elevating their food and water dishes even just a few inches (or more, depending on dog size) can help encourage better eating/drinking habits, which by themselves help promote longer, healthier, happier lives, while also significantly reducing their daily pain and stress. The bowls should be elevated just enough that they can keep a "nose down" position and easily access the contents, but without having to stoop at the major joints.

Elevated pet dishes can be purchased from the usual retail outlets and pet specialty stores, but the same net effect can be achieved with a variety of household items, such as used parcel boxes (amazon, etc), bricks, wood blocks, etc.
