YSK: There is a Air filter for the cabin of your vehicle. It is most likely behind your glove box. Replacing this can help with your allergies and breathing.

I was walking around Walmart while my oil was being changed and I stumbled across this air filter with arm and hammer odor remover and I knew about the engine filter. So I looked into this and switched my cabin air filter..... The cabin air filter I removed was extremely gross. The car is an 07’ and I don’t think it was ever changed. Leaves dirt and who knows was in the filter. The smell of my car has significantly improved. 

Edit:
Walmart sells them for roughly $15-20 dollars and most filters only take 10 minutes to change. Oh.. And mostly only 2000 and newer vehicles. 


TLDR: cheap part but effective to improve smell/allergies in the ‘cabin’ of your car.
