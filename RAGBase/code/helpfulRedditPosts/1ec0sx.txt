LPT: If you're setting a goal for yourself, don't tell anyone about it.

content:
I saw this the other day in a [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html) by Derek Sivers and realized I've been going about doing shit all wrong. 

Basically, you shouldn't tell people your goals because 

* subconsciously: proclaiming a goal makes your brain think you've already completed it, giving you a sense of satisfaction without actually doing any of the work
* consciously: you think you've already made a step towards your goal, allows you to procrastinate more
* makes you more likely to give up sooner than if you kept your goals to yourself, because you think you have less work left than you actually do ([1982 - Peter Gollwitzer study](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/05/12/talking-the-talk.html))

We think our friends will hold us accountable, but they have their own shit to worry about.

I've noticed that in the past when I told people that I *won't* be doing something that I want to do (because I'm lazy), I felt dissatisfied and end up doing it.
