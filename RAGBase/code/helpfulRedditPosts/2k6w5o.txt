LPT: If you do shift work, make a point to be nice/friendly to the people that work the shift before you. If they like you, they'll do what they can to make your shift easier for you.

I work graveyard shift in a nursing home.  We have several halls and we're moved around on a regular basis.  Every day the scheduler makes out a paper to where you can see which hall you're working on and who's working the shift before/after you.  If the people who come on shift after me are people I like/get along with, I'll make more of an effort to get little extra things done for them to make their morning easier.  For example, I'll try to get some people dressed or set out outfits for them, clean up rooms a little bit, or set out extra bed linens.
