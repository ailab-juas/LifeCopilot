LPT: if you’ve been invited over for a get together by someone you’d like to get to know better, offer to come over early to help set up. This will show that you’re a giving friend and can give you the opportunity to have some one on one time before everyone else shows up.

Edit - don’t know why people are missing the part where I said “offer.” No where did I say to just show up early without the offer being accepted.

There are many ways to ask this that do not put serious pressure on the host. You can also offer to bring something or ask if they need help cleaning up after, a simple “let me know if I can help or bring something!” Every person needs to decide what works best for themselves and take the other person and context into account. This is what I like to call “thinking for yourself.” (Those that constantly join the hive mind might want to try it some time.)

And for the people arguing that this is going to induce some kind of deep anxiety in the host because they’re afraid to say no: saying no is a life skill everyone needs to learn. I would never support pressuring someone and I would always advise that a person is thoughtful of another’s feelings. BUT I will not live my life walking on eggshells at every turn out of fear that someone may react badly when I am sincere and kind. There will always be people who choose to think the worst and many comments on this post are a prime example of that.
