YSK: Poisonous pokeberries are easily confused with beneficial elderberries

content:
Why YSK: They look similar, and you could poison yourself by eating them. Both are ripening now in the Northern Hemisphere.

" Elderberries tend to grow in more of a round cluster, while Pokeberries grow in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically...  The leaves are more of an oblong shape versus a rounded leaf."

Pokeberries are beneficial for wildlife, so they're worth leaving in less conspicous spots.
