title:
YSK that a Box Turtle only roams 1 mile its whole life. If it is removed from its area/home then for the rest of its life it will roam aimlessly stressed out, trying to find its "home" until it dies a very sad death.

content:
Please do not remove turtles. Do not take them home as pets. If one is injured please mark the exact spot found for the wildlife center. If a turtle is in the road you can help by moving it directly across the street in the direction it was heading. Many people think it is harmless to let their children take home a docile turtle to play with and release it someplace they see appropriate.
