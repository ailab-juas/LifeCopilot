LPT: if you need to defrost your windshield, you can do it more quickly by flipping down both of your sun visors.

Flipping down the sun visors will direct the air down and back towards the windshield, circulating it a bit more. This will help the hot air stay by the windshield longer instead of traveling along the ceiling to the back of the car.
