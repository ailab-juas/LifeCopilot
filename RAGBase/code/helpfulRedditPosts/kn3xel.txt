title:
YSK: If you make a mistake with your baby’s name or change your mind about the name, in the United States and in some other countries, you have a grace period in which to change the birth certificate without a court order. Some states allow a whole year even.

content:
Why YSK: because mistakes happen and minds change, especially during such an emotional and stressful time. You don’t have to live with regret because you messed up the spelling or you suddenly realize that the baby’s name just isn’t the right one.
