LPT: Please wear your seat belts. I just had to check for a pulse on a 17 year-old laying face down in the dirt. He didn't have one.

About 30 minutes ago I was driving home from the movies, saw a civic hatchback wrapped around a tree and ran over to check on them. At least 3 other people were standing there taking pictures on their phones. No one had called 9-1-1.

I yelled for someone to call and then checked on the two kids that were in the car. One was crushed inside the driver's side and the other was ejected. Checked on the ejected one first; he had no pulse, wasn't breathing, and multiple bones were out of his body. The other was having trouble breathing and struggling to get out so I calmed him down, kept him talking to me, and stabilized his neck until the paramedics arrived. He had to be cut out of the car with the jaws-of-life.

**PLEASE WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS!**

**Edit:** I typed this up about 30 minutes after law enforcement let me leave, it was after midnight. I left out a few details and didn't clarify things so I will now:

* I am fine. I did not witness the accident. I arrived moments after it happened.
* I was in the army and part of basic training is combat first aid. A lot of this applies to real life situations too. It just kind of kicked in.
* I did point to a specific person when I yelled "CALL 9-1-1, NOW!" She did.
* I directed other by-standards to stop all traffic coming on our road (one-way road)

For those saying that I should have tried CPR on the kid that was ejected:

* He was laying face down
* I checked for responsiveness
* I checked for breathing
* I saw a lot of blood underneath him, but none on top, so I ran my hands underneath his body without moving him to check for arterial bleeding. His neck had a massive hole in it that half of my hand fit in. I could feel bones.

I am around for a bit if anyone has any questions. I'd be happy to answer them.

**Edit2:** The driver is in the ICU, but will live. The passenger was pronounced dead at the scene.
