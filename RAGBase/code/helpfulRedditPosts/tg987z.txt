ysk: New AirBnB Scam to Avoid

content:
Why ysk/TLDR; A ‘supposed landlord’ sold us a tenancy agreement on a property that he never owned, but was actually owned by someone else who was just hosting it out as an AirBnB; the supposed landlord took our deposit and first months rent and then vanished.


Today, me and my partner were involved in a seemingly new scam involving AirBnB occupants listing AirBnB properties as rental tenancies, that I feel it might be worth raising to the attention of this community.

So we were on the market for a rental property just to get us by for a few months. We stumbled across a nice little one bed apartment local to us, it was perfect, fully furnished the lot. It was a reasonable price and offered nothing out of the ordinary that would indicate ‘too good to be true’.

A quick little backstory that we were given from the supposed landlord - will call him Greg - was that he previously had the apartment as an AirBnB and was now wanting to let it out as a more reliable income stream, hence it being furnished and having a bit of a short term stay feel about it. 

We got to the place, met with Greg (the supposed landlord) who showed us round the place, he was smartly dressed and professional, still, nothing out of the ordinary and well conducted. 

We were happy with the place so we followed on to the paperwork, once again, all handled professionally.. we wasn’t actually expecting to go through with the acceptance so soon but since we were pretty dead set on the place, we made agreements with Greg that we would come back to him later on in the day to exchange the deposit and hand over the keys - we had to sort out a couple of last minute finance bits before going ahead.

Well this is where things get sketchy.. 

So we call Greg and arrange to meet, he said ‘hows about just doing it at the local costa’ since he was there at the time, in hindsight, slightly odd but we had done all the paperwork to this point, what was the worry, right? 

We met him quickly in the carpark, as by this point he had already grabbed the coffee, we sent the deposit money and the first months rent, in exchange for the keys that were willingly handed over after the payment went through. (To clarify, still nothing out of the ordinary since it was a registered bank we sent it to, no cash or anything etc of course) 

All exited to see the new place with keys in hand, we return to the property to see someone at out door! Alarm bells rang at this point as to who on earth this was, he further explained that he owned the place and that it was rented out for a day to some who ‘checked out an hour or so ago’.

Realising the situation, it was clear, Greg had just rented the property for a day, taken pictures of the place while staying there for the tenancy listing, and just so happened we were the first suckers who fell in the trap for it. 


I feel this is not a well known scam going by google and something worth being aware of out there. Just want to avoid anyone else getting stung by the same thing. 

A wise idea would be to always check AirBnB or similar services for the location BEFORE enquiring. 

Although its all been reported to authorities, i see little hope of us getting our money back at this point so I just hope I can save anyone else getting caught out.
