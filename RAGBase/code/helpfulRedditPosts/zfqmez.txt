LPT: Good pillows are worth the money.

content:


As we get older we start to wake up with more aches and pains.

I've worked in pain management for 10 years and I always tell my patients: Buy good pillows not the cheap Walmart ones.

If you start waking up with your hands and arms going numb and your doctor can't find out why? Or you have been in a car accident and only have whiplash with no serious spinal injuries? 

Get a cervical pillow to sleep with. They are about $50USD slightly uncomfortable at first. Cervical pillows will help with migraines as well as with tight aching burning muscles. By supporting your spine properly your muscles are able to relax.

Have lower back pain?
    
 If you sleep on your back put a pillow under your legs.     (for me I put in under my thighs). This allows your spine  and muscles to decompress.

Sleep on your side with lower back pain? A pillow between the knees will help with that as well if you have hip/knee pain.
