title:
YSK cats like drinking away from their food bowls

content:
Why YSK: Instinctively cats prefer water sources away from their waste and food. The thinking is they want to avoid contamination and disease. Makes sense. 

From the human perspective I've always put their bowls together; water and bikkies. I have a drink with a meal, so why wouldn't they also like that? Recently though we've put drinking bowls around the house and they drink so much more and seem to even just drink for fun and really enjoy it.
