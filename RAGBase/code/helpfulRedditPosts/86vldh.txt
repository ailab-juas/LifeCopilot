LPT: When someone asks you an uncomfortable or too-personal question, respond with, "Why do you ask?"

content:

I like this reply because it works for wide variety of situations, and it's not super confrontational but it still alerts the questioner that whatever they asked is really none of their business. 

Picked this trick up a few years ago from someone in an NPR interview who said they always respond with that to questions about their brother's suicide. Can't remember who was being interviewed, so I can't find the link, but it's been a helpful reply to remember!
