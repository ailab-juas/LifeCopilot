LPT when a friend asks to borrow money/goods/your time, it is FAR less awkward to refuse to help than it is to ask to be repaid.

Sure, there are exceptions to the rule. 

eg, Dave, who you have known for 10 years, gets paid tomorrow and the auction for a genuine Harley has been mislabelled and it's going for £5... well... it'd be a dick move not to lend him the fiver. 

On the other hand, Bob who you met at work last month asks to borrow £30 till next payday... but last payday was last week. So... just say no kids!
