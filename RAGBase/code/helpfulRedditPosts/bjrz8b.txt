YSK about the Power and Control Wheel

content:
[The Power and Control Wheel](http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf) is a tool used to determine if a person is committing or being subjected to long-term acts of abuse in a relationship. **While the document is worded to be geared towards women, IT APPLIES EQUALLY TO MEN.** If you can check off any of these boxes, you are in a potentially dangerous relationship. If you have to ask yourself if something is normal, chances are it isn't. I'm a domestic abuse survivor and my abuse went on as long as it did because I genuinely did not know what was happening wasn't normal. By that point, I had been conditioned to believe I deserved it.
Domestic abuse hides in the dark. By shining a light on what constitutes acceptable behavior, we can stop abusers from continuing their actions.

EDIT: For context, I met a man in my early 20s who isolated me and gaslighted me into what I can only describe as a sort of despair-based paralysis. I was able to get out due to a sudden medical circumstance and have been out for about six years now. While no abuse is identical, there are certain behavioral flags that signal trouble. These are applicable to BOTH SEXES--I cannot stress that enough-- and while they're not a black and white guide nor even close to a complete list, they can help clear up questions about whether or not something is "normal."

It is NOT NORMAL for your significant other to:

* Restrict who you speak to or socialize with (i.e. my girlfriend won't let me text other women, my husband won't let me go out without him)
* Invade your privacy on a consistent basis (my girlfriend makes me unlock my phone so she can read my texts, my partner makes me show them my emails, my husband makes me show him what I'm doing on the computer)
* Isolate you from your family and friends ("You don't need anyone except me," "If you really loved me I'd be enough for you," "Your friends/family just want to break us apart."
* Hold things/people hostage ("I can't trust you to manage your own money because you're a liar," "If you ever leave me I'll take the kids and run away," "It's either me or (blank)."
* Create a system of servitude (you are in charge of all the chores in the house in addition to working full time but are not allowed to make major decisions regarding finances, children, etc and have no control over your own income)

* Manipulate you through mind games or "tests" (my girlfriend frequently texts me from random numbers to see if I'll flirt back, my spouse poses as various men on social media sites to try and trick me into cheating on him, my partner breaks up with me and tells me later that it was a test to prove my loyalty)

* Minimize your concerns ("You only cry when we fight because you know you're lying," "I didn't even hit you (that hard)," "All couples fight," "No one will believe you anyway."

* Use sex as a weapon (performing sexual acts on you that you do not agree to or want to participate in, forcing you into sexual situations that you do not consent to, withholding sex as punishment for bad behavior)

EDIT 2: As suggested by a few users, [here is the same Power and Control Wheel but with neutral language.](https://www.thehotline.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/06/power-and-control-wheel-updated.png) A lot of people are getting caught up on the format/language of the Wheel but I'd like to stress that what's important here is the information contained, not the way in which it's presented.
