LPT: If someone you meet for the first time says something to the effect of "Oh, I was just testing you" within the first few minutes of meeting them that person is most likely not someone you want to continue having a conversation with

content:
This seems to be a common tactic of the type of person who will talk over you and thinks their opinion is the only correct one. They'll make some kind of unclear and/or offensive "joke" or sarcastic remark and then if you don't respond with unbridled enthusiasm they'll treat you like a child who doesn't understand humor and then talk about how they do things like that to test people and see if they can 'hang' or if they 'get it'. 

Maybe I'm wrong, but this has happened to me several times and the conversation always ends up going about the same way. People with good social skills don't "test" the people they're talking to. I don't know why I indulge these people, I should probably just leave the conversation as soon as I see the obvious warning signs.
