YSK: If you really want to support your local restaurant, don't order third party delivery (GrubHub, DoorDash, etc). Instead, order directly from the restaurant. Delivery providers charge the restaurant 15% to 30% of the total.

content:
Imagine you place a $30 order.  25% of that may come off the top for the delivery provider.  The restaurant is left with $22.50.  For that original $30 order, 25% of that covers the cost of the food itself and the packaging.  Now the restaurant is left with $15.  25% of the original total is to cover labor.  Now the restaurant is left with $7.50.  25% of the total covers other things like electricity, rent, water, etc.  Now the restaurant is left with $0.  Yes, ordering third party delivery helps them keep the lights on and their employees working but it really doesn't help the business.

\*These percentages are going to vary from restaurant to restaurant but should be close

Edit:  I am suggesting that you use restaurants that have in-house delivery OR you go pick up your own food.  I understand that this may not work in every case.

Edit 2:  I'm seeing people say they support by tipping.  If you order through a third-party app then you aren't supporting the restaurant by tipping.  You are supporting the driver.

Edit 3:  I am specifically talking about those instances where some individuals feel like "I want to help out my favorite restaurant!  I am going to order their food!"  If you're simply trying to feed yourself via the cheapest and/or most convenient method, then do whatever you want  (nothing wrong with this!)
