LPT: When reading a company's Glassdoor pay attention to the date of the review. If you notice a lot of good reviews in a short time frame then that means that HR sent out a bulletin for employees to write reviews for the company.

My company's HR recently sent out a memo to all employees and left up many flyers to tell us to review our company on Glassdoor. This is allowed by Glassdoor and a tactic they advocate for companies wishing to combat their negative reviews or low rating. Though the memo/flyer say to leave "honest" reviews theres an implication that they want us to leave good/positive reviews.

When I had initially started working for my company the rating was in the low 3's and the reviews were pretty sporadic in terms of the date. After the memo I saw a huge amount of positive reviews in a short time frame and their rating went up to 4.6. This overshadowed the negative reviews which I found to be accurate.

edit: Some have asked what does it mean if there are a lot of bad reviews in a short time frame. That usually means that theres been a layoff or a [negative] restructure in management.
