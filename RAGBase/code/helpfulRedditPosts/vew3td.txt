LPT: Stuck in a low wage retail job and want more? The print/sign industry is where to look.

content:
Print shops usually hire green people at a wage almost double of retail work. Yes, you will have to learn new things, but it is super easy. 

I'm a felon that is now making almost 100k per year in the sign/print industry, and we are always looking for people that are ready to learn.  

Edit: This turned into an AMA, and I am happy to respond, but I need to go to bed. I'll do my best to answer you all tomorrow.
