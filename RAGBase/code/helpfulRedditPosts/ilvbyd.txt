LPT: You can't change someone's mind by insulting them. Listen to them, and despite the emotions that may come up inside you, remain calm and whatever their views, calmly argue your counterpoint. Nobody will listen to you if you don't at least act like you respect them.

We are far too quick these days to get emotional, shut down, and start spewing insults or judgement of character when someone has an opposing opinion.

Think about it, when is the last time someone called you a dumbass or some other name and changed your mind?

Fight back on the culture wars. Let's get back to a culture of healthy and polite debate.

*EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up to the point it has, but a lot of you are missing the point. I see a lot of you fomenting the same division and finger pointing ( "oh yeah man I agree with you this is totally how such and such group act") that I am arguing against in your replies. Stop generalizing. Stop thinking with an "us vs them" mentality. We have got to get along regardless of our political leanings, race, gender, religious beliefs, sexuality, whatever identity we choose to divide ourselves on. We have to find common ground. It is the only way forward.*
