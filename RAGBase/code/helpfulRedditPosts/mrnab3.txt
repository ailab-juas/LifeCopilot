YSK: When calling someone about a minor car accident, always start the conversation with "I am okay" or "I am going to the hospital to get checked out for xyz" to prevent unnecessary distress.

content:
YSK:Hearing the words "there was an accident" is one of the most terrifying, heart-wrenching experiences you can have. Do your loved ones a favor and when you call them, open the conversation with "I am not hurt and I've been in a car accident" or a description of the injuries and severity so they don't assume the worst. 

Why YSK: save your friends and family a gut wrenching emotional experience.
