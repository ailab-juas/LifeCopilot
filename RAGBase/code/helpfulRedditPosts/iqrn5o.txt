title:
LPT: If a supervisor ever asks you to do something that you know violates policy or is morally questionable/shady, ask them to send you the request in an e-mail/text message as a reminder.

content:
Many times they will not be willing to write out their request and you can get out of doing it. If they do write it out, you now have evidence of their request directly tied to their e-mail account. If they send an e-mail but try to leave parts out, you can just ask for clarification in your reply (I.e "Thanks for reminding me, did you want me to remove all the safety signs or just the ones in the main hallway?")
