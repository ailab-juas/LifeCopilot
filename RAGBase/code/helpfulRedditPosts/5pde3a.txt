YSK Febreze kills ants and spiders on contact without the noxious smell of most indoor ant killers.

content:
Active ingredient hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and inactive ingredient Benzisothiazolinone used in Febreze make it an effective killer of ants and spiders and has a far less noxious odor than most indoor insect killers. It will not however leave a lasting "kill zone" like other insecticides that can continue killing ants and spiders that stroll over it for weeks.
As far as I know this trick does not work with generic brands of fabric spray because HPβCD is under patent by P&amp;G for the purpose, but if anyone else knows of other brands or offbrands that work let me know!
