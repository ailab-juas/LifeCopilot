YSK one of the best things you can do for your child’s financial future is to add them to your credit card

Why YSK:

Adding your child as an authorized user will allow them to have a better credit score, and therefore lower interest rates, when they eventually need to apply for loans on their own.

Credit histories are based on various things with a large impact coming from: Payment History, Credit Card Usage, Derogatory Marks, and Credit History. If you add your child as an authorized user at an early age, they reap the benefits of your good credit practices. 

For credit cards, the age requirement to adding a child to your credit card is generally 15/16 or not even required. 

Often times people start building their credit on their own when they are around college age, so you are giving your kids a head start at building a credit history. 

Note 1: Obviously you have to be good with your own credit for there to be real benefit.

Note 2: If you don’t trust your teen spending money on the credit card - *you don’t even need to give them a card or access to it*.

Edit 1: based on some comments it seems this may only be the case in the U.S. - sorry Canada
