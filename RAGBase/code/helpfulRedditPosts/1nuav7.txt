title:
Playing chess (and similar games) with children

content:
If you ever find yourself playing chess with a child (or basically anyone who just started playing or is way below your skilllevel), play the game normally until you reached your endgame. Then, turn the board around and let your opponent finish the game versus you.

This will give your opponent a chance to practice the final stages of a game and how to succesfully defeat someone, instead of just losing (which kills his/her interest in chess pretty quick).

PS: I came up with this when I was playing the seven year old son of my neighbour regularly during a summer. I couldn't make myself to lose by playing badly (game gets boring for me this way), on the other hand he was losing interest quite fast after losing three or four matches, and I didn't blame him. It's like playing basketball versus someone twice as tall as you, you just don't stand a chance and it isn't fun, at all.

So, with this LPT I could full force for quite a couple of moves (I did explain most of my moves in this part of the match), then, when I got him cornered I turned the board around and 

* the game became a challenge for me again (trying to drag out the inevitable loss)
* he learned how to actually win a game (which isn't that easy by itself)
* we both had fun

PPS: /u/xarcastic also posted a great tip:

"Before the game starts, let the child pick any 4 pieces (except the king) to take away from your board. Then play as hard as you can.

If they win with ease, they only take away 3 pieces the next time. You still win easily, they take away 5."
