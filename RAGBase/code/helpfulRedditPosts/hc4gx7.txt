LPT: Don't let people guilt you for not being in contact with them. They're not making any effort to stay connected with you either.

I was talking with my aunt today and she was mentioning how I never call her. I felt pretty bad at the time. But, I realized that she is equally capable of calling me and she isn't doing it either. So, don't let people guilt you for doing exactly what they are doing to you(or not doing in this case)

Edit: A lot of people are lashing out at me in the comments. To clarify, I don't mean your grandma, who doesn't know how to use the phone or people trying to contact you but not able to. I am referring to people who are able to contact you but never do and complain how little you call/text them.
