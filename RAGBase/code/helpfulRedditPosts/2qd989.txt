title:
LPT - DO NOT put the boxes of the items you receive today out with the trash.

content:
Believe it or not, there are a lot of people who survive by breaking into houses and stealing things. By setting out the boxes to your stuff you are advertising all of the new things you have inside. Cut the boxes up and place them in a trash bag or better yet, take them directly to a recycling center.

Merry Christmas!!!
