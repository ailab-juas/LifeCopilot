LPT: you can keep people and bots from following you.

content:
For some reason sex bots have been on the prowl, so thought I’d share. Seems a lot of people don’t know how to preemptively turn following off.

Click the small avatar, go to settings, go to account settings and click u/&lt;your user name&gt;, go to “blocking and permissions” and turn off allow people to follow you.
