LPT: Don't buy a "Black Friday" television. They are manufactured just for this sale, and they use substandard parts.

If you're looking for a quality deal on a television, you are better off waiting for the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. The television manufacturers usually put their best models on sale then.  Also, another good time is in late Spring when they're discounted to make room for next year's models. Edit: I should have also included "Door buster" television's. This is when it almost is always the case. Edit: I should say that some of these televisions may be high end, but why be in line at 5am when these same models will be on sale in January? Edit: the TVs definitely have fewer features and "might" be using substandard parts according to a poster.  This does support my claim that they make TVs just for this event.
