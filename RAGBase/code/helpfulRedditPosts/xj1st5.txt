LPT: Switching jobs is a better way to increase income than waiting/asking for a raise.

content:
This is especially true for college graduates who have gained 2-5 years of experience. In most industries this amount of experience is enough to land you a much higher paying job than your entry-level position. 

Even later in your career it’s often financially rewarding to switch jobs every 3-5 years. If you really want to stay at your current job you could still use an offer for another job as grounds to negotiate a higher raise than you would have normally received. 

Studies show the average wage increase when switching jobs is 5-10%, compared to an average increase of 3-5% for annual raises. However, it’s quite possible to get up to 20 or even 30% more! Just make sure you don’t switch too often so you don’t come across as unreliable.
