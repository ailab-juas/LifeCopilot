[Saw this .gif today](http://mkerala.com/u/di/5BJS/1403627226_car_jumps_on_platform_parked_on_the_side_of_the_road.gif) and it reminded me about the importance of shoulder safety and how little people know about it. Believe or not, this kind of wreck happens a lot, and you should know how to avoid getting hurt in the process.

*Warning: This is a LONG post. TL;DR available at the bottom.*

Whenever possible, exit the highway and get off the road into a parking lot or other safe area. This is true even if you've just had a fender-bender or other minor accident, not just if your car is breaking down/out of gas.

If you cannot get off the road and you MUST pull into the shoulder. Do the following to the greatest extent possible:

**For all scenarios:**

* Pull fully into the shoulder and decelerate SLOWLY. Do not brake hard.
* Once you've slowed down, pull as far off the road as possible - ~~into the grass if there's room~~.
* Turn on your hazard lights ~~and~~or, if it's dark, your car's headlights, taillights, and interior lights.
* Grab your cell phone and wallet/ID.
* Stay calm and be methodical. People do stupid things when they panic and rush.

**Scenario A: If a) any part of your car is in the roadway, b) your car is just barely in the shoulder, or c) you feel your vehicle will be difficult to see or could be struck...**

* Exit the vehicle on the side away from traffic.
* If for some reason you absolutely have to exit toward traffic, walk ~~BEHIND your vehicle, never~~ in front of your vehicle.
* DO NOT attempt to do repairs on your vehicle (replace tires, check the engine, etc.). 
* Move yourself, passengers, and pets as far from the car as possible. Walk as far as you can away from your vehicle (perpendicular to the road) then at least 10-15 feet in the direction traffic is coming from (parallel to the road). If your vehicle is struck, you will be less likely to be struck be debris or the vehicle itself. 
* If your car is stopped next to a guardrail or barrier, get on the opposite side of the barrier and move as far away as possible or walk up the shoulder until you can get safely away from traffic.
* Once you are safely away from your vehicle and the road, call for help and provide as many details as you can about your location.
* If anyone stops to help, avoid hitchhiking whenever possible. Most times, the best help another driver can provide is to help get help, bring you fuel, etc. 
* If another driver stops a car behind yours, treat his/her vehicle like yours. Get away from it. Even police cars. 
* Don't ever assume that a police car's lights, your hazards, or flares will be conspicuous enough to keep other vehicles from drifting into the shoulder. 

**Scenario B: If you feel your car is highly-visible and sufficiently away from traffic...**

* Exit the car on the side away from traffic.
* If you can't exit away from traffic, walk ~~behind your vehicle, never~~ in front of your vehicle.
* Before doing any repairs or surveying any damage, make your vehicle and yourself as conspicuous as possible. Use flares, reflective triangles, etc. LED flares are easy to purchase and reusable. Place signal devices substantially up the roadway from your vehicle.
* Ideally, call the non-emergency line for the local police and ask an officer to come out to your location. You may feel silly, but having a police officer present to direct traffic, put out flares, turn on his/her lights, etc. can save your life.
* If you are with another person, station them far behind your vehicle to alert traffic to your presence and keep a lookout (a police officer is still the best choice).
* If you need to get tools out of your trunk/hatch, make sure you close it back up before you start working. Leaving it open is like putting a sail on the back of your car. Passing semis can knock your car off the jack.
* Cautiously make any necessary repairs to your vehicle in as little time as possible. Your goal should not be to make your car completely road-worthy again. It should be to make your car road-worthy enough to get you, your passengers, and your car to a safer location. For flats, it's better to drive slowly on a rim and get off the highway than to change a tire in the shoulder.
* Get back in your car, buckle up, and relocate.

**Scenario C: If you do not feel it is safe to exit your vehicle for any reason...**

* Don't exit the vehicle.
* Lock your doors and roll up your windows.
* If there is room on the passenger side, move across to the passenger seat and buckle yourself in.
* If there is not room, stay where you are and keep your seat belt buckled. 
* All passengers should remain seated and have their seat belts buckled. 
* When you've made yourself as secure as possible, call for help and provide details of your location.

Most unfortunately, I have had to watch (probably literally) hundreds of videos of police officers, accident victims, well-being bystanders, vehicles, etc. get struck while stopped on the side of the road for DOT training purposes. I don't know what neurological glitch is built into our brains (edit: TIL it's called Target Fixation), but it is shockingly common to drift toward the shoulder when there is something stopped there. That's before you take into account the dumb shit people do like texting and driving. The worst accident video I saw was during the aftermath of a collision. Several first responders were trying to give medical attention to a woman who had been thrown from her vehicle. An oncoming driver, who did not appear to be distracted, drove directly into one of the first responders and the injured woman, killing them both. The driver's wife immediately jumps from their car crying "omg, what have we done?!" It was horrifying.

**TL;DR: If you can, GTFO of your car and GTFAway. If you can't, stay inside and buckle up. Make no assumptions about your safety.**
