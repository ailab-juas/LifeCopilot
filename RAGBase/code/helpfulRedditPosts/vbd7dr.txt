YSK If doesn't have to be hot or even very sunny to get sunburn. Always check the UV index and use protection/precautions when going outside in Spring-Autumn

Why YSK: Every instance of sunburn increases the risk of skin cancers, as well as other complications from prolonged sun exposure. If you have time to go out and enjoy nice weather outside, you must make time to put sun cream on and/or use other sun protection.


Today is partly cloudy where I am, only 18C, but the UV index is "Very High". Lots of days like this will be coming up as we move into Summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it does not have to feel very hot or even sunny to get sunburn!


This is your PSA for today, especially for my fellow BritS who are notorious for underestimating the sun. 


Remember: Sun cream, parasols, shade, and cover. Make sure that whatever the SPF, your sun cream has a high star rating for UVB which is the wavelength that burns. UVA is also good to have a high rating as this is for the type that accelerates signs of ageing in the skin.
