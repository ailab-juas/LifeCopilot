LPT: When you get up too fast &amp; feel dizzy, clench your stomach as if flexing your abs - or as if you`re trying to take a dump.

It will force blood up into your head and you'll feel better again.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the attention, good &amp; bad. This really took off. 

Vasovagal increases intrathoracic pressure by trying to exhale againt a closed airway ---&gt; I'm not talking about that. 
What I'm talking about is kind like sucking in your gut - or what your stomach would feel like while doing a good sit-up. Flexing the abdominal muscles if you will.
You should be able to breath while doing it - and it should not take longer than 5 seconds. 

In theory, it would force blood from the inferior vena cava increasing blood flow to the heart. Increased preload --&gt; increased afterlload from the augmented preload as well as increased pressure surrounding the descending aorta would force the blood to the head. 

It's always worked for me when I get up to quick from the dentist's chair, or anywhere where I feel like all the blood rushed from my head.

Of course, if you feel you're seriously at risk for falling down, sit back down and don't back up until you're OK.
