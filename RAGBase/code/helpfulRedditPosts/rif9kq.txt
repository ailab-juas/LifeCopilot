LPT: in a job interview when they ask if you want anything to drink, ask for a glass of water and nothing else!

content:
They will most likely ask if you want tea or coffee, which you absolutely don't and here is why: Tea or coffee leads down a rabbit hole of sub questions to what kind of tea or coffee, with or without milk, sugar or sweetener and possibly with people having to run down to the kitchen for your order. It creates an akward pause at a time when you really just want to get on with the show and will ultimately end up with you getting a piping hot beverage which you have no chance of finishing during a 20 minute interview, where you do most of the talking. So what happens instead is that you burn your hands and mouth and leave most of the cup behind for them to clean up after you leave.

Water is a different story however! you \*do\* want to get a glas (or bottle) of water as it will generally be much faster for them to handle (it will most likely already be in the room) and it has a few practical uses during a job interview: water will refresh you, immediately clear up a dry mouth and give you a natural excuse to take a sip and win a few extra seconds to think about a difficult question.

You came here for a job, not a free dink. Drink your damn coffee on your own terms!
