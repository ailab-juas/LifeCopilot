LPT: When writing, studying, or reading, listen to music with no vocals

**LPT: When you want to write, study, or read while listening to music, you will find it much more pleasant and will perform much better if you listen to music with no vocals, minimal vocals, or vocals in a language you don't understand.**

The reason for this is you will unconsciously try to cognitively process the words of the song when listening to music with lyrics, which will tend to make you feel overwhelmed and make it more difficult to bring all your focus onto what you are writing or reading.  This is also why watching tv or movies or listening to some type of spoken word radio show while doing these activities tends to go very badly, at least for me, turning one enjoyable activity and one productive one into a hectic mess with the combination of the two.

Classical music, jazz, movie theme songs, and word-free EDF tracks are probably your best bets for this type of multitasking, in that order.  And with classical and jazz music at a minimum I think you should find your performance will be improved even compared to just completing your task in silence with full focus.  [And there are studies which back this up.](http://www.phoenix.edu/forward/student-life/2011/08/should-you-listen-to-music-while-studying.html)

Here are some of my favorites songs that are completely devoid of lyrics/vocals:

[The Allman Brothers Band - Jessica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oidm5Zfw_SA)

[Handel - Water Music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuw8YjSbKd4)  plus virtually any other well-regarded symphony from a famous composer (ie Vivaldi - Four Seasons, Wagner - Ride of Valkyries, etc)
