YSK: Depressed people often present as happy or “normal”

content:
Why YSK: Too often, depressed people pass away or don’t get help because people don’t think they’re depressed. You should check in with all your friends/family members, even if they seem happy.

I can speak from personal experience, but can anyone else corroborate this?
