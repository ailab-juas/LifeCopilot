LPT: Tired of signing in/signing out of YouTube, or having to confirm age, for "age-restricted" videos? Change the link to this to bypass it. (view description)

content:
I cannot remember who taught me this trick, but I know it wasn't from reddit.

For example take this link (Watch_Dogs Gameplay Premiere)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LZM3_wp2ps

and make it this:
http://www.youtube.com/v/6LZM3_wp2ps

In short, **take out the 'watch?' and replace the '=' with a '/'**

If you'd like to know what it exactly does, it redirects you to a youtube API link that has no age restrictions. For this video, you're redirected to this:
http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/6LZM3_wp2ps

Did I mention that it maximizes the use of your window, like [this?](http://i.imgur.com/pMwV8Bx.jpg) 

Thank me later.

Edit: thanks to HawkEy3: adding **'nsfw'** before the **'youtube.com'** does nearly the same thing for half the work.
