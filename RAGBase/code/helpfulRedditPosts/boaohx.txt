LPT: One way to help keep hanging out with friends as you get older is to pick a regularly a occurring thing you do together. Ex: every week watch Game of Thrones together, or a sports team (football is best since itâ€™s once a week). Sounds silly when you're young, but keep this in mind in your 30s.
