YSK that today is the last day to send your name to Mars.

content:
“NASA is giving the public an opportunity to send their names – stenciled on chips – with the Mars 2020 rover mission. The rover is scheduled to launch as early as July 2020, with the spacecraft expected to touch down on Mars in February 2021.

NASA will use an electron beam to stencil the submitted names onto a silicon chip with lines of text smaller than one-thousandth the width of a human hair (75 nanometers). At that size, more than a million names can be written on a single dime-sized microchip. The chip (or chips) will ride on the rover under a glass cover.”

Edit: Just want to say this this is one of the most wholesome threads I’ve seen in a while. Y’all are awesome for sending your kids’ and pets’ names to Mars! Also, love the fake names!! (hopefully some of them will make it through the screening process)

Also for those of you arriving late, I believe the link is still up (even though the deadline passed), so go get your name on Mars!
