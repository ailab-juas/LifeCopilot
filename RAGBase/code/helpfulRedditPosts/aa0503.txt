LPT: Instead of buying non-essentials like a bigger flat screen, more or better furniture, big boy toys, more clothes, etc. as soon as you want them (this is almost always a bad financial plan); make a wish list. Budget, save, periodically check for sale prices, and buy on sale.

You will get what you want, you will save a lot of money, and the money you saved from retail price will make your purchases more satisfying.

*Edit1 – OP note: the comments/tips have been great; thanks for participating!

 *Edit2 - Dear haters: 1. This LPT isn’t common sense to everyone. If it is to you, great. Everyone didn’t receive an education that taught them this concept or had someone caring enough to tell them this. 2. There’s a reason billion dollar professional sports franchises spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on the “basics”. 3. You are correct, the very rich need not apply, but they often do.
