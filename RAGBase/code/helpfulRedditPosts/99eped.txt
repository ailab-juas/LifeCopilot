LPT: If you’re going to a baby shower, consider bringing clothes in sizes that aren’t newborn or 0-3 months. A lot of people receive clothes in these sizes and don’t have as many options when their baby grows out of them.

3-6 months and 6-9 months are great options! 

Edit to add: this goes for diapers too!
