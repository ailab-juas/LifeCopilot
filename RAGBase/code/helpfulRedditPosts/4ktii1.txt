title:
LPT: While ending a relationship, be as nice as you can.

content:
 You may be hating that person, you may be sure you will never see them again, you may have a few last words you want to say... But you can't actually know/make sure you will never see them again, you can't be sure that this point is the end of your relationship, and people need people therefore you can never know who you will need on your side in the future. 

 It might be your boss, your ex who was an asshole, your neighbor from your parents' house, your classmate from a class you took for a single semester... No matter what, just try to be as calm and nice as you can as you end your relationship.

 Edit; I'm pretty sure nice and clear does not have to contradict.

 Edit 2; I got it, this is obvious to you. This is common sense. You are all smart individuals that don't need a tip for this. I regret this post as well but there are so many comments therefore I can't delete it. If you are not happy about it, perhaps it would be more useful to not leave a thousand comments about how unhappy you are about this post and just downvote or ignore it, so that it will disappear. (Grammar mistake corrected by /u/edit__police , thanks! I am not a native speaker.)

 Edit 3; Thank you for all the support, everyone! And please forgive my earlier meltdown. I hope the tip was useful to someone somewhere.
