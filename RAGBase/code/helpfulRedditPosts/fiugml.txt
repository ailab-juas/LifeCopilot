LPT: Don’t want Pinterest in your Google search results? Add -Pinterest to the end of your search terms.

content:
I can’t be alone in HATING the million Pinterest results that come with every google search. This LPT is an easy solution.

For example. . .

Before: “Cool sunset pictures”
Result: A bunch of photos that you can’t access because they’re locked through Pinterest

After: “Cool sunset pictures -Pinterest”
Result: No Pinterest results
