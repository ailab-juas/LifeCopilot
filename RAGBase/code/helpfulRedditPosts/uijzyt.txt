I just did this with a new lease they emailed out, and found all the little charges they increased or doubled, such as the "after hours non-emergency calls fee" and the "no admittance maintenance fee." They also added a term stating if I fail to notify them of emergency situations that cause damage, they will charge me to repair the damages.
