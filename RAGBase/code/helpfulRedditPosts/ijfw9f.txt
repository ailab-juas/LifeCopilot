YSK that NPR is doing a series of "Summer School" episodes that teach the basics of economics. Each is half an hour long and very well done.

content:
Why YSK: Economics is such an important field to have a basic knowledge in. It not only informs how you consider public policy, but it can inform how you make decisions in your own life.
