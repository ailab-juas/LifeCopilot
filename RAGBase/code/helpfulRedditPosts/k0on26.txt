LPT: When buying an appliance, don't overlook its decibel rating. In the long run, a noisy appliance can be more psychologically and physically draining than you would think.

content:
 This is especially true for appliances that you use very often or which are continuously on (such as a fridge).

Depending on the appliance and the country you live in, there might be a value in db (decibel) written on a sticker on the appliance or it can be found in the specification sheet. Decibel is a logarithmtic value, so a few decibels less make a huge difference for your comfort (and health).

For loud appliances (e.g. lawnmowers) you should wear hearing protection whenever you use them.
