YSK: How to get a Lynda membership for free.

content:
I was going to Buy a Lynda membership for $40 per month the other day but before I did that I did some research on how to get it for free. I saw online that many colleges have memberships so I asked mine but they canceled their subscription a few years ago.

Then I found a link from the new york public library. It turns out that all you have to do to get a free membership on Lynda is sign up for a free digital library card and you can access all of Lynda's content for free. just google nypl Lynda to do it yourself.

This is also the case for many other public state library's so check with yours and it could save you some money.

P.S. I am Reposting this because the first one was removed due to a link I included. So I am posting it again without the link because I feel like this is something everyone should know.
