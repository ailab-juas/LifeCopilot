LPT: Speak to yourself like you'd speak to a 5 year old version of yourself.

content:
We often treat and speak to ourselves harshly. We judge our actions or inaction and put unnecessary negativity in our lives. Try to speak to yourself as if you are speaking to the 5 year old version of yourself. Speak to yourself with a compassionate and forgiving tone, focus on the positives. I notice my thought becoming too hard on myself, and I ask "would I say this to 5 year old me"? Of course not. We are still that 5 year old child, living in an adult body. Treat yourself as such.
