LPT: If you’re in an interview that’s wrapping up and the interviewer asks you if you have any questions for them, ASK QUESTIONS.

content:
As a hiring manager and potentially your future direct management, I cannot stress enough how much this makes you stand out over other candidates. You can ask anything, but I love being asked questions that show you’re engaged in the position, general questions about culture in the company, or even being asked a question like  “what makes this career exciting to you?”.

Doing these things shows that you’re serious about securing a position, shows professional communication, and tells me that you’re looking for something long term. This gets me excited to work with you and help you on your career growth.
