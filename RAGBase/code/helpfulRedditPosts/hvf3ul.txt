YSK: You're not supposed to rinse your mouth after brushing your teeth.

content:
You're not even really supposed to spit out all the toothpaste. The brushing helps a lot with plaque, but the toothpaste also acts as a chemical to break down other gross germs and clean your mouth over time.

When you rinse your mouth afterwards all that's doing is getting rid of all the paste that's helping your teeth and not giving it time to actually do it's job.. Just scrubbing is better than nothing, but stop rinsing your mouth after (and don't eat or drink right after either) and you'll see a surprising difference over time.
