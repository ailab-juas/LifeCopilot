title:
YSK: When driving and waiting to turn into oncoming traffic always keep your steering wheel straight

content:
This will ensure your safety if you were to get rear-ended. If your steering wheel was already turned towards traffic and you're just not moving yet, if you get rear-ended, you will automatically be shot directly into incoming traffic head on. If you keep your steering wheel straight *until* you start to move when it's safe, even if you get hit from behind, you'll still just go forward and be able to stop safely.


edit: But if I didn't clarify, for example I meant if I am facing north and incoming traffic is going south, and I want to turn west. I should make sure to keep my steering wheel facing north, until I move. [Look at my amazing artwork for an example. The green arrow is my intended turn.](https://imgur.com/fIX60Ym)

Also basic stereotypical comment but I mean it sincerely: Thank you so much for my first ever platinum!!
