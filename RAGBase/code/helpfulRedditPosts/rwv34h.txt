LPT - If you lock yourself out of your car, try calling the local police station instead of a locksmith.

content:
Yesterday I (33M) locked my keys in my truck and was really at a loss for what to do. I tried looking up some locksmiths in my area and there was one in town but they didn’t even pick up the phone. Others were at least 45 minutes away. I called a buddy and he said to try the police station in town. NOT 911, but the actual police station. 

I called them and they sent over a patrol car with two kind officers within ten minutes. They had a wedge and a slim Jim. One officer said something like “I’ve gotta tell you there’s a chance we could damage your door and we’re not liable” yada yada yada. I said let’s do it. In three minutes they were able to fish out my keys. I thanked them and was on my way. Saved me probably two hours in the cold and ~$150. No charge. Just a handshake and we were on our separate ways.

I live in a smallish town (10k people.) Po po was happy to help.
