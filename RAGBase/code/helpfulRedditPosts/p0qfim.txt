Why YSK: There is often misconceptions about anything other then the breast being bad, but that is wrong. Sometimes the mom doesn't get enough milk, so the baby becomes underfed. It is perfectly fine using formula to feed the baby.

It's good to breast feed if you can, but sometimes you don't get enough milk, so sometimes resources are needed. And that's perfectly fine! People shouldn't shame others for not being able to breastfeed.
