LPT: Cockroach infestation? get rid of them with baking soda

content:
make little balls of baking soda and onion juice. onions attract them and when they eat it they explode since they can't burp. other roaches will eat the dead. nothing to clean up except the last one. if you hear popping sound at night its working!
