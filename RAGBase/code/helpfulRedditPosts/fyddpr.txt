YSK if you need to entertain kids during this lockdown, there is an amazing website that does live videos of animals all across the world, in zooâ€™s, islands and some ocean cams too

[explore.org](https://explore.org/) 

My kids absolutely love it, and there is a free app for Android and Apple too

Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger

Edit 2: Few people commenting about the spelling of zoo, I apologize but I cant edit the title
