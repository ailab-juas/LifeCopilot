LPT: When Running Or Exercising, Run Your Headphone/Ear-bud Wires Behind Your Back.

content:
I learned this from my friend who plays drums with an in-ear monitor. To keep the wires out of the way, he has the ear bud wires run behind his back. I adapted it to running and exercising and it works great. I usually run the wires under my shirt as well. This keeps the wires from bouncing around and getting pulled on.
