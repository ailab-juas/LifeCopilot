YSK: Porn is nothing like real life

content:
First of all, it doesn't represent what the average person is like. Most people's dicks don't look like that. But also a lot of things in porn are straight up fake: everything from the semen to the moans to occasionally the boobs. What's more, porn often lacks some of the great things about real life: the intimacy, the love/lust, the messiness, the smell.

Other things in porn that don't represent real life: the amount of body hair, the situations that initiate sex, the number of orgasms, the lack of condom use and clear consent (actually, condoms often can't be worn in porn because the friction from a lot of takes can be painful).

Why YSK: Don't try to make your real-life situations like a porn, or make the mistake of thinking your body is inadequate because of what you see online.
