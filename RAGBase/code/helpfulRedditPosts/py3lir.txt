LPT When eating out, try to avoid buying desserts (except in specialized places), most of the restaurants aren't making them and just sell you a frozen, premade desserts from a third party, at a ridiculous markup.

I work for a Warehouse who delivers for 80% of restaurants (the white trucks with the red lettering, if you know, you know). I also work in the freezer department and many clients we have, of not all, order frozen desserts that are made by third-parties like McCain and such.

For exemple, let's say you order a pecans pie with a ball of ice cream. The ice cream come from an 11.6L (about 392 oz)  box of ice cream that we sell to the client for about 15$ and a frozen pie made by Martin's, Daboom or McCain usually. Many of them are 10-15$ for the hole pie. The restaurant then sells you the dessert for $10-15 plus taxes and tips for something worth $2-3 (you order only a slice of it).

Cakes ? Frozen and premade too. Crème Brûlée ? same thing. Volcanoes, fondant, ect are all frozen desserts not from the restaurants themselves that you can buy at your supermarket.

EDIT : God damn some of y'all are the most sodium based individual i've seen. If that doesn't apply to you and/or just don't care, then move on, damn...
