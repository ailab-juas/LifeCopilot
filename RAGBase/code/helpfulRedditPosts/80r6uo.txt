LPT: If you need an engagement ring, seriously consider a moissanite. They look amazing and are a fraction of the cost

I had the talk with my wife.  Do you want a huge baller rock that’s a moissanite or a small conservative diamond.  She wanted the bling.  I have a good job so everyone assumes it’s real, and it looks amazing.  Spent about $2200 on it for a 2 carat center stone, in a halo, on a white gold band.  They are even cheaper now.

Do some research, as there a few lines of high quality colorless moissanite that are much nicer than the super cheap ones.

edit* I found my actual invoice and apparently I only spent $1800, which is still a lot, but that was for the stone, and the setting/band as well.  I think anything thats not a real diamond is a great alternative.  I just personally went with this stone as I think they look awesome.

edit2 thanks for the gold, kind stranger!  Feels weird on a discount jewelry post but I’m not even mad.
