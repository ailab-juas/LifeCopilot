LPT: Hairspray makes a better bug spray than bug spray.

content:
I live in an area with a lot of flying insects. When they get in my house I reach for a can of hairspray. They drop like a rock as soon as you hit them with it and it’s easy to dispose of them afterwards. Many times I’ve seen wasps and hornets fly around crazy after getting hit with bug spray….not so with hair spray. It’s also seemingly less toxic than chasing a wasp around your house with a can of Raid.
