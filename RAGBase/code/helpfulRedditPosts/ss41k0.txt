LPT: Ex Florist Here. Don't buy Flowers on Valentine's. Especially roses.

content:
It's probably too late now but even buying a few days beforehand can dramatically decrease price. 

The flowers on Valentine's have often been kept in a fridge for a week or so and are no way near as fresh as usual. They are typically 3 times the cost on Valentine's for a worse product. 

In fact, I don't reccomend buying flowers at all. They're not that great for the environment, uses a lot of plastic, uses up heaps of fuel to be flown all over the world and are a part of the Imperialist/Capitalist cycle.

Buy a cool plant from your local nursery instead. They can purify the air, they look cool, and you get a little plant baby to keep!

Edit: Seems like a few people were triggered by me implying the cut flower trade is imperialist. Western owned conglomerates with monopolies outsourcing their labour and farm space to poorer countries IS imperialism idk what to tell you. Even if a farm in those countries is locally owned they only have a few options to sell their product to on an international scale and the buyers can set the price. This is the case for many industries and it's a result of capitalism. If you don't care or think it's a good system that's fine but you can't deny this happens.
