LPT: Use hair straighteners to iron creased collars and hems in a hurry.

content:
I find this really useful when I work early shifts.I regularly iron my clothes, but using my straighteners on a low heat setting really helps to get out a few creases in between washes.I wouldn't do this to very expensive or silky clothes,but it's great if you need to smarten up quickly.
