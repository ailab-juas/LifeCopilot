LPT: When making reservations at a restaurant/hotel/etc. for a special occasion, let them know what the occasion is. Exception: You are planning a wedding, then don't tell anyone you are planning a wedding.

I've been pleasantly surprised many times by doing this.  Received a half bottle of champagne on my bed at a hotel for my birthday, a free tour of a winery (valued at US$80) for my honeymoon, the list goes on.  

The hospitality industry can sometimes be hospitable if you let them.

In Re: Weddings. Everyone wants to charge you double if they find out your event or purchase is related to a wedding. Don't let them!
