LPT: Adjust your growing pets collar regularly, you should be able to fit at least two fingers underneath.

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback.

For those of you saying this is not a LPT and common sense when looking after a pet, I somewhat agree, although what prompted me to post was a picture I saw on r/aww of a Christmas puppy with a collar that looked incredibly tight.  

I'd also like to echo many of the comments that say not too loose either! Make a good judgement for your pet.
