LPT: If a family experiences a miscarriage, pretend they have just lost a 6-month old baby so you don't say anything unintentionally hurtful.

* Well, you can always try again.

* It wasn't meant to be.

* Have you considered adoption? (especially if there have been multiple miscarriages)

* It must have not been healthy, it's better this way!

 . . . can be extremely hurtful to a grieving couple. If you wouldn't say those things to someone who recently lost a child, don't say them to someone who has miscarried. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who shared his/her personal stories. I may not be able to respond to all of them, but I have been reading them and my heart goes out to you all.
