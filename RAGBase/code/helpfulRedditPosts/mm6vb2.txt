YSK: You can hack an excel file to get rid of the password protection

content:
Why YSK:

If you've been in a situation where you have a password-protected excel file and can't make changes or you forgot your password. There is a way to remove that protection. If you did not know, Excel files are also zip files with coding. The password protection is SHA-512

Changing the excel file extension from .xlsx to .zip allows full access.

Editing the .XML of the workbook and worksheets is where the encrypted password is added near the end of that file that literally says, "sheetProtection" or "workbookProtection" with SHA-512 scrambling. Deleting that string of code removes password protection.

When done. Rezip the file back up and change it from .zip to .xlsx and it will function as a normal excel file that you can edit.

It's much easier to learn this through video than pure explanation.

Disclaimer: I  do not own the video posted below. I am not the owner of the Youtube channel Excel Dashboard Templates. I am not employed and not associated with the channel. I only found this channel again because I had to open another password-protected Excel file in order to arrange the data for better screening recently. I forgot how to do the steps. All credit goes where it's due.
