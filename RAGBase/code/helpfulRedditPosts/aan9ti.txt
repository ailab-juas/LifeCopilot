YSK you can opt out of physical junk mail as well as emails. This reduces waste and stops you from getting mad at useless mail

content:
A few months ago I received a State Farm letter, a chewy, hello fresh, and geico all in the same day all addressed to “Cien_fuegos or current resident” 

All I did was go to their websites and find the email/chat support and give them my name and address and ask to be removed from physical mailings. The only one I had to talk to again was Hello fresh. I haven’t gotten anything from them in a couple months so I’m guessing that’s done. 

This helps me reduce my carbon footprint and reduce local waste. I now get mail only a couple times a week at the most. 

Pair this up with the USPS email notification about what mail I’m getting that day and I don’t even have to go outside some days.
