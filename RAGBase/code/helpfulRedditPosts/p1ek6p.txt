YSK: most commerical semi trucks are governed to 65mph

content:
Why YSK: as a commercial truck driver I often get flipped the bird and other beautiful sign language while driving. Most of the time it's after it's taken me a little while to either pass a fellow truck driver or someone in a regular passenger vehicle that just can't find the gas pedal. We don't purposely pass that other vehicle slowly unfortunately that's as fast as we can go. So next time your behind a semi and wondering why on earth he's driving so slow, it's because we have to.

Edit: thank you everyone for the awards I appreciate all the positive and negative feedback. I'm glad I could make some people aware of it and hope I don't receive as many "number one fan signs" as I do.

This post doesn't speak for **ALL** truck driver's like my title says **MOST** trucks can't go faster then 65mph and you must remember we are people to and people can be assholes I'm sure there are some trucker's that like driving slow and holding up traffic but I'd like to think most aren't that malevolent and aren't trying to slow you down on purpose.
