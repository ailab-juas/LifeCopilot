LPT: If you're considering going to Target on thanksgiving to purchase on of those 50" Element TVs, reconsider.

I'm putting this out there because I think a lot of people are uninformed about this brand and I would like to weigh in some insight. I worked in the electronics department at Target last year and I spent a lot of time getting to know our televisions. The Element brand which Target sells is a lemon. Last year, we had about 30 of them to sell on our Black Friday sale. Over the course of two weeks, about 15+ were returned for being defective. I would try to offer the 3 year warranty with it, and was always turned down, but would then be yelled at by angry guests after the 30 day return policy that they couldn't do anything but go through the manufacturer's warranty, if they had already rejected ours. And lastly, the Element televisions that would be on display on the tv wall at Target, constantly have to be replaced for being defective. I can't tell you how many times the speakers would blow, or the power supply would short out. 

**TL;DR: The Element brand of televisions is shitty, put your money torwards something else.**

Also, I'm sure I'm going to hear some rebuttal about how some dude has had his Element for 4 years hooked up to his xbox and plays COD for 16 hours a day and has never had a problem. Congrats, you're the 1%.
