LPT: You know that project, chore, workout, etc. that you keep saying "I'll do it tomorrow?" Set a timer for just 10 minutes and start it knowing that when the timer goes off, you can stop. Chances are VERY high that once you get to the 10-minute mark, you will be on a roll and keep going.

***It's critical that you only set the timer for 10 minutes, not a minute more!***

The 10-minute timer ensures that you have the mental reassurance that you CAN stop after 10 minutes if you want, so you don't feel the awful pressure and dread that always makes you want to keep putting it off. But there's about a 90 percent chance that you'll be *totally in the groove* at that point, and you'll just keep going. 

(*On the* ***very slim*** *chance that after 10 minutes you DO want to stop, then stop! Feel good about yourself for getting something overwhelming* ***at least started****. And then just keep doing 10-minute chunks every day - and on one of those days the groove will kick in, much sooner than you think*.)
