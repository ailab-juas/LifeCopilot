title:
YSK if you lift your truck you need to adjust your headlights

content:
The reason you need to adjust your headlights is your have changed the height they shine from. Now this may not seem like a big deal however. You are blinding people in low vehicals even with low beams 

The reason is since you've change the height you've changed how far you lights shine out meaning where it landed at say 20 feet out it now lands at 35 feet and blinds people 35 feet in.

This is the same for lift and bigger tires.


Reason I bring this up is driving home from my grandmas in my bone stock 2003 S10 I was blinded by a parked 2017 or so lifted ford with 20 inch rims or so.

I unrolled my window and stopped. I told her she needed to adjust her lights or something. She though it wasnt possible and then told me her lifted truck was stock. I said hers definitely has a lift and bigger tires. She replied with get a bigger truck.


It's ok to be wrong just fix it


EDIT this post wasnt made for people to bitch about "cunts" "cucks" "assholes" "small penised" etc in lifted trucks it was made to inform people if you dont like a demographic be polite about it
