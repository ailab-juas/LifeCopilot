LPT: When a cop asks "can I search your vehicle " always say "NO".

content:
I've seen many articles in the news lately about cops seizing people's cash for a simple traffic stop. You have the right to object to any officers requests of searching your body, your personal things, this includes your car without a warrant or probable cause especially if you have nothing to worry about in the first place. If they ask for a reason, tell them you know your rights and in some cases you can say they're wasting your time. I've dealt with this situation a few times and have been successful in objecting their request.
