title:
LPT: When buying baby clothes for someone that is expecting a child, get clothes for older age groups (3-6 months, 6-9 months) not newborn. Parents receive a ton of newborn sized clothes already and the baby will probably not get to wear all of them before outgrowing them.

I can say from experience that parents will greatly appreciate having larger clothes since their infant will inevitably fit those sizes at some point.
