YSK: The police can AND WILL lie to you

content:
The police will lie about lots of things to get you to confess if they think you are guilty. They might tell you they have a video recording of you commiting a crime and will offer you a nicer penalty if you confess.

**EDIT: Instead of „shutting the fuck up” please say that you are invoking your 5th amendment right to remain silent**

NEVER CONFESS TO ANYTHING, ANYTHING, UNLESS YOUR LAWYER TELLS YOU TO.

Their basic idea is that „okay I think they did it, so we will lie to them that we have strong evidence against them, they confess and we can succesfully throw a dangerous criminal in jail! yay!” This reasoning might seem awful but the motive itself is not that bad - if you think someone did something horrible you probably want them punished.

Also, don’t talk to them at all without a lawyer, EVEN AS A WITNESS. They might try to make you incriminate yourself - it’s a common practice in some countries for the police to first interrogate you as a witness and only then as a suspect, because as a suspect you have more rights.

I know some of you might get shot for doing so, but if the police starts to act like they are taking away your freedom ask them „AM I BEING DETAINED” and if they respond „yes” ~~don’t say ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL~~ *say you are invoking your 5th amendment right to remain silent.* If they show up at your meth lab just ~~shut the fuck up~~, wait to see your lawyer and only say what they told you to.

Why YSK: Everyone should know their rights and what to do not to incriminate themselves. Lots, LOTS of innocent people have confessed to crimes they didn’t commit, simply because they thought that the police has evidence strong enough to convict them so it’s better to confess and get a better deal.

#This doesn’t just apply to the US, it’s legal in lots of countries

Edit: some of you probably think it’s illegal. It is. And while it can hurt people it also can help with capturing dangerous criminals - I posted this here because I’ve read an article about a girl  ***In India*** who allegedly hired a hitman to kill her parents because she wanted the inheritance sooner and the cops told her that „they have a video from nasa cameras of her doing it”. She confessed.
