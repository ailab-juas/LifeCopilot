LPT: Don’t get angry at someone with social anxiety if they don’t want to come out of their comfort zone

content:
It doesn’t help, it just makes their anxiety worse. Try to encourage with positivity instead. Say, “it’ll probably be fun” and say it’s okay if they don’t want to. Making it comfortable for them to “come out” will increase the chance of them actually doing so.
