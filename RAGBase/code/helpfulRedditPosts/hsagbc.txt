LPT: To stop yourself from mindless snacking or eating out of boredom, try drinking a glass of water first.

content:
Studies show people tend to eat, not hydrate, in situations where theyâ€™re just thirsty. The body has trouble differentiating between mild hunger and dehydration due to the subtly of the symptoms.

Staying hydrated has other benefits beyond preventing snacking's excess calories, such as assisting digestion or reducing bloating. The water in your stomach may also communicate to your brain a greater feeling of fullness, and reduce your cravings.

However, the best and most obvious way to stop unnecessary snacking is to stop buying snacks you cannot resist eating. You can also store them in hard-to-reach places to make yourself think twice before going to grab it.
