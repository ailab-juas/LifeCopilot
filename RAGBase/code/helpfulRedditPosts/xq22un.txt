LPT: If you're new to a neighborhood, make a point to regularly go for walks. The more people see you around, the more likely they'll strike up a conversation with you or you'll feel more confident to strike up a conversation if you've seen them several times during your walks

The more people see you around, the more likely they'll be curious to get to know you.

Edit: I posted this tip for people who are new to a neighborhood and want to get to know their neighbors, even in just a friendly acquaintance level way but don't know how. If you don't want to communicate on any level with your neighbors, even a friendly 'hi', well, then this tip isn't for you.

Edit 2: Dang, I didn't expect this LPT to blow up like that.
