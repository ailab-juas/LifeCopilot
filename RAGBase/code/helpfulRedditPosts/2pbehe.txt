LPT: Follow the three S's when doing your ladyfriend's laundry.

When you're switching clothes from the washer to the dryer, remember:  
If it's Sexy, Stretchy, or Sheer, hang it up to dry.  

When in doubt, leave it out (of the dryer) - messing up/shrinking/ruining her bras, sporty stuff, and delicate clothing will put a sour note on your nice gesture.   
  
Taught this to my bf when we moved in together- 9 months later and no ruined clothing!  

** EDIT: Sheer means [kinda see-through](http://www.sheknows.com/beauty-and-style/articles/971701/how-to-wear-the-trend-sheer-tops). An additional S would be Sheep (that is, wool- sweaters and stuff)

*** EDIT EDIT: If I could, I'd change the title to say IF doing ladyfriend's laundry. Do laundry! Don't do laundry! Send out for dry cleaning! - Whatever floats your boat.
