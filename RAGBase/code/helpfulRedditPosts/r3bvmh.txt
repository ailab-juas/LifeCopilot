title:
YSK That Tipped Wages still have to be compensated up to Minimum Wage.

content:
Why YSK: If you work in a career where you earn tips as a wage and are getting short of your full minimum wage pay then you're federally entitled to it. Many people get abused in the system, and if you are fired for asking for that pay you can report it.

Edit: As requested since my interior comment hit rock bottom so it wont get noticed, this applies only to U.S policy.
