LPT: When heading out to an amusement park, or any other large volume attendance venue, take a good picture of the children individually, before you go in. That way if, god forbid, they get lost, you have the exact details of what they are wearing and what they look like to give to the authorities.

Edit: Obviously, take pictures of your own kids.
