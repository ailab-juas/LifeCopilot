title:
YSK that the hymen is not an accurate indicator of virginity.

content:
The hymen, also known as the vaginal corona, is not a magical piece of skin that disappears after having sex. It’s just a ring of skin around the vaginal opening. It is impossible to be able to tell if a woman is a virgin by looking at her hymen. Here are just a few reasons:

1. There are many different types of hymenal shapes that a girl can be born with. Most are annular shaped, which is the classic “ring”. More common hymen shapes are crescent, fimbriated, and dentate. Some hymens can be shaped problematically, such as the imperforate hymen, septate hymen, and the cribriform hymen. ***Some girls are even born without a hymen!*** Because hymens are able to have an infinite amount of shapes, sizes, and thickness levels, it is too difficult to be able to tell if a hymen is shaped the way it is because of natural genetic variation or because it was altered in some way.
2. Some women have hymens that are very thin, and thus can easily be injured just from doing things like bike riding, gymnastics, horseback riding, wearing tampons, and even tripping and falling down. Even though thinner hymens are more likely to be injured and torn, they can usually repair themselves, just like any other skin on the body. If a hymen tore and never healed, that would mean it would never stop bleeding, ever. If the hymen permanently changed shape, size, or thickness after an injury, that means **there is scar tissue present**. Again, this can happen without having vaginal sex at all.
3. Some women have hymens that are very thick! If you are a woman with a thick hymen, chances are, you can ride horses and bikes, do gymnastics, wear tampons, and have full blown penetrative sex without ever injuring your hymen whatsoever. Hymens are usually pretty elastic.

In autopsies, rape kits, and gynecological exams of children who were victims of sexual abuse, doctors aren’t checking whether the hymen is still there or not. They’re actually checking to see if there’s any bruising, injuries, or bleeding in the genitals.

Your hymen will not “grow back” because it never disappeared. **It's always been there!** That is unless of course, you had your hymen surgically removed, cut off, or weren’t born with one.

Basically, it is **not** a normal bodily function if your hymen “breaks” or “pops”. It means that you **physically injured your hymen**, the same way your lips on your face will tear if you stretch them too wide when they’re dry. Your lips won’t disappear, they’ll just be temporarily injured. If the injury is severe, then you might have scar tissue, causing your lips to be permanently disfigured. Same goes for hymens!

Virginity tests on women and girls is physically, socially, and psychologically harmful and they are POINTLESS.

Here is my source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437416/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437416/)

Besides all that, virginity is a social construct anyway! Everyone has a different opinion on what makes a person a virgin. Some say that a girl has lost her virginity if anything has been in her vagina. Others say it has to be a penis. Others say a girl is no longer a virgin after she’s been raped. Some say a girl has lost her virginity only after she has had consensual sex. Some say a girl having sex with a girl isn’t taking away her virginity, and others say it is.

People really need to calm down about vaginas, hymens, and virginity.


Here is another, better explanation from Veve Bee, a child abuse pediatrician:

“The diagram is from the Children’s Hospital of Minnesota. 

With the recent celebrity attention to hymens, I have been meaning to write some thoughts on the matter. For the past 10 years, I have been working as a child abuse pediatrician, taking care of hundreds of girls who have been victims of sexual assault. Those of us in this line of work know a lot about hymens, the female anatomy, and so-called virginity.

So here’s my PSA:

Virginity is NOT a physical entity. It is a social construct, a tool by which women have been kept powerless and shamed for centuries. 

“But what about the hymen?” you ask. Doesn’t it “pop” or “break open” when a woman has sex for the first time?

Nope.  

The hymen is simply a thin bit of tissue, a vestigial remnant that sits at the entrance of the vagina. It is absolutely useless (unless you are a guinea pig. Their hymens do regrow for protection and recede when the female is in heat.  To quote Todd Akin, female guinea pigs can actually “shut the whole thing down.” But humans aren’t guinea pigs).

Here are some facts about the hymen:

1. The hymen has no purpose. Zero. None. Nada. Contrary to popular belief, it does not serve to help infant girls from getting fecal matter into their vaginas. It does not protect from infections either.
2. Hymens look like hair scrunchies, and much like hair scrunchies, they are stretchy. They stretch to fit a penis and other objects. They really stretch to fit a baby.
3. The hymen is ALWAYS open. Baby girls are born with holes.  On rare occasions, girls are born without openings. This is a medical condition called an imperforate hymen, and it requires surgery to fix. There are other variations on hymen morphology as well, such as septated hymens (with extra bands of tissue across the opening), but since the vast majority of women fit into the typical category, I will keep to that here.
4. If hymens weren’t open, girls would not be able to have periods. That’s why imperforate hymens need surgery to make an opening. 
5. Studies show that women who were pregnant and women who have never had sex have identical looking hymens. 
6. Only 50% of women bleed at first intercourse. (Beware of technique issues too).
7. If injury does occur to the genitalia from sexual activity (or otherwise), it does not mean that anything got “broken open”. The vulva has many parts to it that can be injured (see diagram), not just the hymen. Also, the vulvar tissue is the same as what is inside your mouth. If you bite the inside of your mouth, it may swell or even bleed. But a couple of days later, it will be completely healed. A woman’s vulva, and hymen, does the same. 

So why is the myth of virginity one worth busting? Well first of all, it’s not accurate, and women need to know the truth about our bodies. Secondly, women around the world are still subjected to virginity testing and other intrusive and dangerous practices to prove, ensure, or “reinstate” the mythical virginity. Third of all, this: (trigger warning)

A 13 year-old girl sits on my examination table. Her uncle started raping her when she was 7 years old. I tell her that she looks healthy, and that she is going to be okay. She asks me, “Am I still a virgin?”

I say yes, and I tell her why.

Because she looks just like any other girl her age. In 95% of cases, the hymen heals completely after an assault. 

And because virginity is not a physical state. 

It’s not something that can ever be taken from you. 

It’s a concept, a mental and emotional decision you make to give of yourself when you are ready, and not when someone decides to be violent with your body. 

And because being raped is not the same thing as having sex. Having sex WITH someone can only happen with consent. Otherwise, it’s just violence from one person to another, period.

She cries, her whole body shaking, with tears of relief. Then she dries her tears and smiles for a new beginning. 

So let’s stop the shame and humiliation. Enough is enough.

Disclaimer: Thank you all so much for reading this post. It was originally private on my personal page, but a handful of friends asked me to make it shareable. I never thought it touch such a chord.  

This post is for information only. It’s not meant to be medical advice. Please see your doctor for any concerns about your body.

Also, I have used the terms “women” and “girls” in the post, but certainly it would apply to anyone with this type of anatomy, as the topic above would pertain to them as well.

I have seen many folks mention the different appearances of hymens, especially septates and cribiform morphologies. These variations are important to acknowledge. This post is dealing with the most common appearance amongst people with vaginas. This is not meant to take away from the experiences of others. Perhaps I will write more about these morphologies in a new post at some point. Once again, if you have a question about your body, please consult your doctor.”
