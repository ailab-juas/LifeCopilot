LPT: Even if you work at a job with a "casual" dress code, dress to your bosses boss. The clothes you wear and how you present yourself can go a long way.

Recently I met with a career counselor since I've had a few upsets starting my professional career. The best advice she gave me was to "dress to my bosses boss". Ever since I have shown up to work in professional shirts(sometimes button downs, sometimes other stylish shirts) and ties. The reaction has been night and day from co-workers.
