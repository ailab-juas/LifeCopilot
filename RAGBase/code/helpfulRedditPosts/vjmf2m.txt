LPT: When traveling, if you come across a restaurant you like, ask the staff where they'd recommend to eat next.

I was in Chicago a couple years back and went to a White Sox game. Asked a guy seated next to me where to eat lunch the next day. They directed me to Lillie's Q. While there we were impressed with the food so asked the server where to have supper downtown, with the stipulation that it couldn't be the same cuisine. They sent us to Ramen-San which was the best damn ramen 8ve ever had.
