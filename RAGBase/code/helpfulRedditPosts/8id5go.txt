title:
YSK you can keep a cheap disposable razor well maintained for months with a pair of jeans

content:
If you use a clean pair of denim pants to strop a razor it will clean it and maintain it for use much longer than a few shaves. Swipe the razor opposite direction of shaving along a tightened pair of blue jeans (30 swipes is fine) and watch your shave improve. Also your razors will last practically forever.
