LPT: If you run out of time and can’t do something, don’t say, “I didn’t have time to do it,” Instead say “I didn’t make it a priority.” Change your perspective; we all have the same 24 hours in a day, and (for the most part) choose how we spend them. Prioritize.

Edit to clarify: I should’ve said “think” instead of “say”. 

This is meant to admit the truth to yourself and improve, and not necessarily meant to say to others (unless the situation warrants).

Further edit, since there are still comments that “I’d never say this to anyone”. **I don’t mean this should be said to another person.**

Also, some are saying sometimes they have no choice. **I don’t mean this should be applied to situations you can’t control**, like skipping a bar mitzvah because you have to go to the emergency room. Come on! 



If you sit back at the end of the day, and say, “Man, I don’t feel like I got anything accomplished today. I needed to mow the grass, have lunch with my parents, and fix the squeaky stair. I just didn’t have time.... Well, at least I managed to level up four times in Call of Duty.”

You had time to do those things - at least some of them - but you gave something else priority with your time.  Call of Duty was your priority, not the other things.
