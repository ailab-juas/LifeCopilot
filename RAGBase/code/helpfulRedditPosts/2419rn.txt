LPT: Most college campuses are clearing out this week, visit thrift shops near campuses for good finds on all the items students couldn't take back home.

I helped some friends move out of their dorm this week and saw multiple Goodwill trucks loading up and leaving campus. Friend said the local Goodwill will take huge loads of unwanted goods, from clothing to furniture that people just don't want to deal with hauling back home. In the time I was there 2 large delivery trailers were filled from their hall alone. They said the trucks will be delivered to stores surrounding campus first and then further out as inventory fills up.

Edit: To address a couple recurring themes in the comments. 

This school is located in Arizona, apparently they end the school year earlier as well as start earlier than others in the area.

Many people are saying that the stuff most students would be willing to donate is probably garbage anyway. I was surprised at the number of nice looking items sitting out, including multiple mini fridges and furniture. If you're making a good living, yes this is useless but this is also golden finds to other, especially those who may be starting college next year and will be needing similar items. 

The amount of stuff I saw going into the garbage was sadly almost equal to the items being donated so yes, dumpster diving would be a great option if you're down. I know I used to be, until I almost lost a thumb on broken glass.
