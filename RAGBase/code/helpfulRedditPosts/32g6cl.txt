LPT: if you know you will need to reply to someone eventually, do it right away.

content:
Too often, I find myself reading a text or an email that I'm simply not excited to respond to. So I read it, tell myself I'll sit on it for a while and figure out a good response. 

9 times out of 10, what you end up saying doesn't change between the first time you read the message to the time you start to finalize your response. So respond immediately. 

That way, you don't have it hanging over your head, you get bonus points for punctuality, and if the reaction to your response is unpleasant nonetheless, then it's over and done with sooner. 

EDIT: Should have specified. I was not talking about the context of elaborate emails in the business setting or even of angry exchanges between exes, etc. More so, for example, if that step-parent that you dread has invited you to dinner next week, or if your friend asks you for a ride or to go to an event coming up in the near future, or your boss asks you about availability. I was going the simple route.
