LPT: If a bird ever gets into your house turn off all of the lights and open a door/window outside where there is visible light (Like a porch light or a streetlight)

No idea how this works but we had to do it tonight at work. A bird got inside and one of my coworkers said to shut off all the lights and open a door to the dock (Which has lights). The bird flew around for a couple seconds and then flew out the door. He said it also works well with bats.
