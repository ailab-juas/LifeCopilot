title:
LPT: Facebook app users, stop being tracked!

content:
This is something I was completely unaware of prior to this day.

If you use Facebook, and have the Facebook app, chances are it’s tracking everything you’re doing on your device.

***How?***

Through something called ‘off-Facebook activity’. You read that right, Facebook is recording every action, game, Instagram post, bank log ins, pictures, etc. while the Facebook app is not being used.

***Why?***

Debate in the comments.

***How can I stop this from happening and ensure my privacy in my life?***

Turn off Off-Facebook Activity now!

Go into your Facebook settings

Scroll down to the ‘Your Facebook Information’ in which you should find ‘Off-Facebook Activity.’

Once you are in ‘Off-Facebook Activity’ start by clearing your history.

Proceed to ‘Manage Future Activity’ by clicking on the ellipses in the top right corner.

Turn off ‘Future Off-Facebook Activity.’
