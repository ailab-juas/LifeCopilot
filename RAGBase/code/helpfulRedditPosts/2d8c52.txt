LPT: Have a mouse problem? Soak cotton balls in peppermint oil.

content:
I live in NYC and my last apartment had an awful mouse problem. I didn't want to use traps where I had to deal with a live mouse, and the poison caused the mice to die in obscure locations and then stink up my apartment. I then read this tip online and, no exaggeration, I *never* saw another mouse: soak cotton balls in peppermint oil and place the cotton balls by wherever you see the mice darting in and out of. Peppermint oil is a very strong smell and the mice can't handle its intensity. Eventually, I didn't even have to use the cotton balls anymore because the mice had learned to avoid my apartment! (Added bonus: your apartment will smell like Christmas.)
