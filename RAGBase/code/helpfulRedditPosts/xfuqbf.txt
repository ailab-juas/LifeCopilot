YSK There are hundreds of different Sign languages that differ by geography, even between English-speaking countries.

Why YSK: There is a common misconception that Deaf people in English-speaking countries all sign ASL. There is American Sign Language, British Sign Language, Irish Sign Language, etc. and these sign languages are vastly different from each other.

If you go to the UK and start signing in ASL, you will be greeted with a puzzled look. Learn the right sign language for the community you want to engage with.

As a bonus: Black American Sign Language is a distinct [dialect](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3HDm3kx3rhY) which has itâ€™s own grammatical syntax and history.
