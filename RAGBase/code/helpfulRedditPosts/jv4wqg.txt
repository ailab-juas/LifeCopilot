LPT: People in abusive relationships trying to get out. Using a multiplayer game that lets you chat with other players is a good way to hide your messages from your abusive SO.

content:
If you're in an abusive relationship and your SO checks your phone, download a multiplayer game like Among Us (it's on iOS and Android). You can create a private game and invite friends and family to discuss your plan without raising too much suspicion.

It's not the greatest solution, but hopefully it could help people who have no other options.
