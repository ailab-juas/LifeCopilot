LPT: If you can't run for more than a mile when working out, try running in intervals of 1 minute running and one minute walking to get used to working out for a longer period of time

I have an on-site gym at my apartment complex and every time I go to run, I can't get more than a mile in before I feel like I'm dying. Tried the interval running today and went the whole 30 minutes, no problem.
