LPT: if you care more about convenience and simplicity than self expression, limit your wardrobe to 2-3 colors that match each other and 2-5 manufacturers that fit you well

A few years ago, I made the decision to switch my wardrobe to only white, grey, and black, and to only shop from 4 or 5 brands I know fit me well. 

Doesn’t have to be black and grey, either. You could do the same with blue and brown, earth tones, shades of green, or whatever. 

Now, I can basically get dressed in the dark, pack half as many clothes on trips, and never be worried about clashing. All my clothes match one another, and I don’t waste time shopping different stores that I know don’t fit me well. In fact, shopping is 100x easier, because if I see something I like, but it’s not available in one of those colors, I’m not tempted to buy it in a color I like less. 

Another pro tip: if you like something, buy it in all of your chosen colors. Limiting styles to things you like (the same T shirt in 3 colors, the same sweater in 3 colors) makes this simplification even easier.
