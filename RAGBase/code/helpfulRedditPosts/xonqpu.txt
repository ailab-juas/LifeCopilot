LPT: if you work at a front desk job and say the same thing over and over you probably say it really fast. Remember that even though you repeat it, it is new information to people so you need to say it slower

I went to the doctors office and the woman at the front desk told me to fill out some forms. She gave some details about the forms but said it so fast that i didn’t get it. I realized that because she says the same thing over and over it is second nature to her, but for me I was hearing it the first time and it was way to fast. I’ve noticed this a lot with people working front desk jobs
