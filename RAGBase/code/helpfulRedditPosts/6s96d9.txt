LPT: If you don't watch Football, plan your grocery shopping around Football games.

content:
Here is a search of the entire [NFL schedule.](https://www.google.com/search?q=nfl+2017+schedule&amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS748US748&amp;oq=nfl+2017+schedule) Look for when your home team is playing and go to the grocery store when they are playing. Football fans will have gone before hand to stock up on snacks therefore the whole place should be less crowded.

If you like Football, that's cool this LPT isn't for you.
