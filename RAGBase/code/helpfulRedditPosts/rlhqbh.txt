YSK that the 'cheap' gifts that you receive from your employer might actually be paid out of the pocket of your manager.

Why YSK: I know it's the season to shit on shitty corporate gifts, and I'm all for it in the event that the money does come out of the corporate budget, but before you light your torches when you get your present, consider that what you received was paid from the pocket of someone not too far removed from you.

25 years ago, when we all got our first 'real jobs' out of college, I remember many of my mates bragging about their company-funded golf games and company-expensed dinners and amazing Christmas bonuses. In retrospect I think most of them were exaggerating/lying, but I always wondered why I never had those perks.

Come Christmas, my immediate manager (we were a team of 12) went around and gave envelopes to everyone. 'Here's the fat Christmas bonus I hear everyone talk about', I thought to myself.

I open the envelope and see a $15 gift certificate to a retail store. 'That's it?' I thought to myself 'I bust my chops all day for $15?' I was livid.

I was livid all the way home. Livid that evening. Livid that weekend. I told my gf how livid I was. I expected her to be livid along with me.

Instead, she said "That was nice of her, spending her own money like that." That's when I realized that this wasn't a cheap gift, but an amazing, thoughtful gift. I was so obsessed with myself, that I didn't realize that we were the only team to get something.

My manager - who wasn't getting paid much more than us, but who had way more financial responsibilities than us - took it upon herself to go out and get each of her team something with her own money - almost $200.

I felt terrible for feeling the way I did, but it taught me a valuable lesson in life.

Happy holidays, everyone!
