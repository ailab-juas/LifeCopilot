LPT: If you grew up in a family that was clearly dysfunctional, educate yourself on the Codependent/Narcissist dance before you saddle up with anyone.

content:
You will save yourself a lot of heartache if you understand the basics of  why you may be strongly attracted to  a narcissist. 30 minutes of reading about the abuse cycle and your trauma response  can give you  what to look out for in a partner. Its very obvious once you know. But you don't know what you don't know, unless someone points you to it.

Update: I didn't post any specific resources because I didn't want to guide people to things that weren't relevant to them, or have anyone think I was promoting anything. However, so many people have asked, I follow Lisa A Romano's "Breakdown to Breakthrough" podcast. She is very authentic and avoids a lot of the negativity of other more click-baitey people out there. Here is a video of her listing books that helped her. [https://youtu.be/8vagJVTwsB4](https://youtu.be/8vagJVTwsB4)

Update 2: I apologize if the 30 minute comment seemed to trivialize anything. I simply meant that a person can familiarize themselves with the language of the dynamic in 30 minutes. So many people have requested some basics and so here are two links that I think fit the bill.
