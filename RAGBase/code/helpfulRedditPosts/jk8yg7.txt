YSK: Do NOT Feed Table Food to Pets when you’re a Guest at Someone’s Home

content:
Why YSK: no matter how much the animal is begging or how much you’re trying to get in it’s good graces, under no circumstances should you give table food to someone else’s pet unless they have explicitly said it’s ok. 

I have two dogs and one of them has a severe heart murmur. You’d never know by looking at him because he’s full of energy and is so playful but if he eats anything with too much sodium, I’ll be in urgent care that evening. If you were the one who fed him the tater chips after I asked you not to best believe I’ll send you the bill in the mail.  

Also you don’t know what kind of bad behaviors pet owners are trying to correct and by feeding from the table you could be interrupting that training. 

Just don’t do it.

EDIT: so this blew up in a wild way. It’s interesting that the comments are half “my relative/roommate does this and it drives me crazy” and half “this should be common sense.” You know what they say about common sense: “people are fucking morons and not a lot of them have common sense”😉

Also I’ll add that I’m lucky to have dogs that don’t beg and I too hate when owners don’t recognize that this may make guests uncomfortable. The reason people wanna feed my guys is that they’re really fucking cute.
