Recently there has been an uproar over the [IRS planning to send 1099-Ks to "gig economy" income earners who make &gt; $600 transactions](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k)

Many were also concerned about proving to the IRS that transactions were personal or for reimbursement from friends and were therefore non-taxable in the event they were mistakenly sent a 1099-K

**Why YSK: Zelle is not required to report any transactions to the IRS, and the law pertaining to 1099-Ks does not pertain to the Zelle network.**

If you are concerned about getting 1099-K'd for personal transactions, consider using Zelle

&gt; Does Zelle速 report how much money I receive to the IRS?

&gt; Zelle速 does not report transactions made on the Zelle Network速 to the IRS. The law requiring certain payment networks to provide forms 1099K for information reporting does not apply to the Zelle Network速.
