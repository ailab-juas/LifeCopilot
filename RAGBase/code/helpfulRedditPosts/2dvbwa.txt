YSK that you can turn any YouTube video anto a GIF by just adding “GIF” to the URL

content:
Want to turn something on YouTube into a GIF, but don’t want to futz with downloading third-party apps or digging around for an online converter?

Here’s a handy, easy to remember trick: just add “GIF” to the beginning of the URL. After “www.” and before “youtube.com”

So, for example, you’d turn:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

into:

www.gifyoutube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

and hit enter.
