title:
YSK there are anti-chafing products that runners use that can also be used for thigh rub

content:
Why YSK: summer is here and wearing shorts or skirts as a person with thicker thighs can be a challenge, so these products can help reduce chafing on a day-to-day even for when you are not running.

I've learned about this relatively recently and I've found that a lot of people that I know whose thighs tend to rub find it hard to find the right shorts or even have to wear bicycle shorts under skirts to avoid this; they didn't know that these products exist in sports stores either. Especially within climates that tend to be more humid, chafing is quite the annoying issue and these products can help a lot.
