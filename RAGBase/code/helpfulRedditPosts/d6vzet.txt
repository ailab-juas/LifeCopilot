YSK that Windows 10 can seriously limit your internet speed

content:
...unless you fix a setting in CMD.

I could only achieve a 110mbps speed test on a 220mbps connection and it left me scratching my head. Bought new cat6 cables and everything. Turns out after a lot of digging I stumble across a thread saying to enter the following command into CMD:

    netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal

Instantly after entering that I ran another speed test and voila, the speed I was actually paying for. My PC has been capping my speed for god knows how long without any indication. I hope this helps somebody else.

edit: the following can be used to check your current setting, look for "Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level:"

    netsh interface tcp show global

it seems like the setting is already "normal" for a lot of people, but if yours isn't, it could be hampering your speed without your knowledge. Definitely worth checking.

Thanks for gilding
