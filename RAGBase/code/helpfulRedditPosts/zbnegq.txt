LPT: you shouldn't feed ducks bread, but they go nuts over a bag of cheap frozen peas or corn

content:
my birthday was yesterday. spent less than $5 on some bags of frozen corn and peas, and took those and some freezer-burned lima beans to my local pond to feed the ducks. literally every single duck and coot from the pond was gathered around me eating. 10/10 will do again
