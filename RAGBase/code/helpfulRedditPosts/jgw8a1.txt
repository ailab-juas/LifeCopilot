Why YSK: Spending more money on expensive wine is usually a waste and most people can't tell the difference anyway, not even wine enthusiasts.

[Here's an example](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/new-york-restaurant-mistake-mouton-rothschild-1989-446051-446051/).  "NY restaurant couple mistakenly served $2000 Mouton 1989 after  ordering $18 Pinot. A young couple who ordered an $18 Pinot Noir at  Balthazar in New York found themselves enjoying Mouton Rothschild 1989  listed at $2,000 following a mix-up, according to owner Keith McNally.

Staff at Balthazar poured the two wines into identical decanters, but  the one containing Mouton Rothschild 1989 was accidentally sent to the  young couple’s table, said the New York restaurant’s owner, Keith  McNally.

Four Wall Street businessmen at another table had ordered the  Bordeaux First Growth – the most expensive wine on the restaurant’s list  at $2,000 (£1,528) – but were served the $18 Pinot, the restaurant’s  cheapest, said McNally.

None of the diners appeared to initially spot the error, McNally  said, reporting that Balthazar’s manager on the night said the host of  the business dinner praised the cheaper wine’s purity."
