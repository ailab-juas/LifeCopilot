YSK that if you have a Verizon plan with unlimited talk/text/2gb data for $90, you might be able to lower your bill to $60 for the same plan.

TL;DR Verizon has a special "smartphone loyalty" plan that you can call them about. It's unlimited talk/text and 2gb of data for $60 a month.  (Check submitted photo)

I used to be on a special Verizon plan with no messaging, 200 minutes per month and 2 gb of data for $60 a month, but it was on my brother's contract and I was the only phone on it. 

Eventually I decided it was time to get the contract in my name, and when I did they said that I needed to get a new plan! The Verizon rep I talked to said that I have a very limited plan(obviously) and that there was a special "loyalty smartphone" plan that was available, for the same price as what I was paying. The plan has unlimited talk/text and 2gb of data, so I was like, sure. And I've had that plan ever since.
 
Since it is a loyalty plan I do not know if everyone qualifies; and from what I've heard, not every Verizon rep knows about it. (This is what I gathered from people online) but the plan does exist. I know someone who themselves just got the plan a couple of weeks ago(she also put her phone onto her own contract), so obviously it is also still available. 

See the attached photo if you don't believe me! You can even show the photo to a Verizon rep I would think.

EDIT: One other thing. Though I have not confirmed this, I am under the impression that discounts do not apply to an account with this plan. 

Also this plan is really only available for single smartphones. I do not know if there is anything similar for more than one phone. 

EDIT 2: This has to be done through Verizon. I used to work for a Best Buy and they do not have any access to such a plan. So if you got your phone there and have loyalty to them, don't bother. They'll have no idea what you're talking about.
