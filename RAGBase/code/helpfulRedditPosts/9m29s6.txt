title:
YSK that many bars offer free soda to designated drivers

content:
If you’re going out with a group and are the DD, just ask the bartender if they offer free sodas to designated drivers. More often than not, it’s on the house. 

Edit: *You have to ask for this!* If you just walk up and ask for a coke, they won’t know the situation and won’t assume you’re being a responsible party and comp the drink. You need to specify.
