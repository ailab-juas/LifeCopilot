title:
YSK that your credit card probably includes free extended warranties, insurance and other benefits

content:
In addition to financial perks like cash back, you should know that most credit cards offer a ton of non-monetary perks which automatically apply to any purchase made with that card. These can include:

- Extended product warranties 
- Damage / theft protection
- Rental car insurance 
- Trip cancellation insurance
- Roadside assistance 

You should review the terms and conditions of your card carefully, as these policies vary and may not be as comprehensive as one from a dedicated third-party insurer.
