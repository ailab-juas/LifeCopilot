title:
LPT: Reminder. Monday is Memorial Day, not Veterans Day. Don’t thank servicemen/women for their service on Memorial Day

content:
I’ve seen this advise on this ~~thread~~ subreddit before but it’s always a good reminder. This weekend is about fallen soldiers and most of the men and women in our armed services will be remembering the people they have lose and would want the focus to stay on them. Some of them may have survivors guilt or other issues and thanking them might bring that back up. The day to celebrate our veterans is Veterans Day, or any other day of the year for that matter. The one day we shouldn’t celebrate them is Memorial Day.
