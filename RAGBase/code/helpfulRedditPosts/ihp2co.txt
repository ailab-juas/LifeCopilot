LPT: As hurricane season approaches, make sure you microchip your pet. It may be the only way to reunite with it if the worst should happen.

content:
I volunteered at a shelter that took in animals lost, displaced, or temporarily surrendered during Hurricane Harvey. 

The influx of pets in an emergency situation often totals in the hundreds - if not thousands. This means volunteers will have an even harder time trying to locate your missing pet. Even if your pet is in safe hands with a rescuer, shelters fill up and your pet may be relocated without you knowing. The only guaranteed way for us to find your pet is if it's microchipped. Collars are easily lost and are not enough.

Also helpful - if your pet travels in a hardshell crate, write some basic contact information directly onto the housing of the crate.

Even better, create an emergency plan for your pet now so the risk of losing it is even lower.

Edit: I'm fully aware hurricane season has already begun and we've had some devastating storms. I wasn't as mindful as I should have been when posting, and the title was poorly thought out. Sadly I can't change it, so I apologize.

However, this advice is applicable regardless the emergency. Hurricane season isn't over. Other natural disasters exist. Pets get scared or overexcited and run away. Microchips are your best bet.
