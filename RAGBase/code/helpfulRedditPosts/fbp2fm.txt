title:
YSK that if you ever lose your ticket to a concert, play or other event, the box office will reprint it for you.

content:
Box offices are really good about reprinting lost tickets. They will cancel the barcode on the list ticket and get you a new one. You do need to know the seat location and have ID or proof of purchase. And if you bought your tickets from a broker, call the broker. They should be able to connect with the box office to get it reprinted.

Edit: I should say this isn’t 100% guaranteed. You will definitely want to call the box office to confirm. If bought from a reseller, contact them directly. Edit made based on your guys’ feedback.
