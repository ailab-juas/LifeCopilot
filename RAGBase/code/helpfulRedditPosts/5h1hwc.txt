LPT: If you work Mon-Fri, schedule something you enjoy for Wed evenings. It will help break up the week.

I have been finding the work week long. And constantly find myself  looking forward to the weekend. It's a tiring exercise. And as we all know, it makes Mondays really rough.

But I've recently joined a sports league, and play badminton every Wednesday night. Mondays can still be tough, but Tuesdays and Wednesdays I'm looking forward to badminton. Thursday and Friday, I look forward to the weekend. 

Yes, ultimately you should love what you do, and not need to look forward to things like the weekend. But sometimes, this is the reality of the situation.
