YSK motorcycles and bikes don’t often get caught in you blind spot monitoring system. Always look over your shoulder and save a life.

Why YSK - now that it’s summertime there are many motorcycles and bikes sharing the road, their size dont often allow for blind spot monitoring systems (blis) in cars to catch them and give you the usual audible and visible warning.

I am a very careful driver and always look over my shoulder before making lane changes. Over the past few years since my new car has blind spot monitoring I have stopped religiously checking over my shoulder everytime trusting the system would catch anything. The other day I almost hit a motorcyclist because I didn’t check and the blis never caught them. That shook me back to my senses and I religiously look over my shoulder now during lane changes.

Bonus YSK - most blis systems don’t work well during bad weather be it rain or snow.
