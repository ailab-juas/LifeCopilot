title:
YSK that asking your doctor to chart your request and their denial of testing will often result in getting the diagnostic tests you want

content:
Plain and simple. Doctor refuses blood work or another diagnostic test? Ask them to put in your chart that you specifically requested the test and they denied it. Most doctors will just send you for the test.

EDIT- I have stated some things in the comments I thought I’d add up here just so I don’t need to repeat myself 

Don’t be a jerk to your physician. Do not be hostile or threatening. Ask politely for things to be documented. 

If you have the resources to “shop” for a doctor, please do! Look around until you find somebody who you trust completely. 

This is for actual medical problems that you are experiencing and not for curiosity’s sake. Medical testing is not something you do for fun. 

If you are asking for something unreasonable your doctor will refuse and still chart it. They are still in control of your health and should not be providing potentially dangerous testing because you asked for it. This includes any sort radiology, rare, or invasive procedures. 

Thank you
