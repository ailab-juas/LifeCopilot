LPT: Financial illiteracy is a disease you probably won't notice you have until it's too late

content:
I took a basic personal finance course at uni to boost my average mark and it turned out to be extremely illuminating for me. Turns out it's very easy to be financially naive because that's the way the world wants you to be. If you ever contemplate engaging in any kind of self-help, I would strongly recommend personal finance. The fundamentals are simple and could have a seriously profound impact on your quality of life.

Edit 1: I'm aware financial illiteracy isn't a medical disease. I still think it's not a totally unreasonable description of this disposition though. Financial illiteracy can be inherited or acquired, it can be chronic and it can seriously impact upon quality of life. Uncontrolled debt is also an issue which we may well be conditioned to understate the seriousness of. 

Edit 2: Many thanks to my peers who generously elaborated on specific personal finance resources. I didn't make any recommendations for a couple of reasons, but mainly because I was just trying to advocate for the importance of taking the first step which, IMHO, is simply entertaining the thought of personal finance principles. There are plenty of fantastic, high quality resources available on the internet which have been cited in this thread. There also may be resources relevant to your specific country, and I'm sure those would be easy to find with a Google search. Best of luck!
