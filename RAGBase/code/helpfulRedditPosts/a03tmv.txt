YSK that you can buy the opioid overdose reversal drug over the counter 46 states.

YSK that in most/all US states you can buy the opioid overdose drug (naloxone) without a prescription [for about $20.](https://www.goodrx.com/naloxone) You can save a life by having it on hand. If you know anyone taking pain medication, using opioids, or any illicit drugs that might have fentanyl or opioids mixed in, you should get some naloxone, learn how to use it, and keep it around. 

You need a prescription in only a few states: Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. In general you may be able to get a prescription from the pharmacist in these states, depending on whether the pharmacy/pharmacist is participating. 

[To use naloxone check out these instructions.](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/responding-to-opioid-overdose/administer-naloxone/)


REMEMBER THAT EVEN IF YOU USE NARCAN/NALOXONE YOU NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE OR GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. The dose doesn't last long, and you can OD again when it wears off if you don't get help. If you can't call 911 for whatever reason, call Poison Control (800) 222-1222

Another edit: Also ice or ice water will not reverse overdoses, although they can wake someone up who is having a very intense high and is on the border of ODing.
