LPT: Don’t donate platinum awards, donate koala bears as they give $2.50 cents for Australian fire relief.

Edit: If you have money, donate directly to the fire relief organizations, don’t spend money on Reddit coins to give koala awards.

They are koalas not koala bears, I am very sorry for the mistake.
