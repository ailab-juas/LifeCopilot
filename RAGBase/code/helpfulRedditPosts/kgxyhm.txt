LPT: if you are taking a significant other/close friend to go skiing or snowboarding for the first time then pay for them to have lesson rather then teach them yourself.

content:
I worked at ski resorts for over a dozen years, and many times I tried to teach those I am close to and care about how to ski/snowboard. I can tell you that it almost never works out well for either party. It is so much enjoyable to meet up with them after the lesson and do a couple of runs together.

Also, I highly recommend just renting the gear rather then letting them borrow your gear. This way they get the right stuff and no one has to worry about damage to personal gear.

Edit 1: thanks /u/greenturkey11 &amp; /u/tbdl147 &amp; others for the awards :)

Edit 2: my true intentions were to hear the great horror stories from both types of parties!
