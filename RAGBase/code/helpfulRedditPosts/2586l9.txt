Some examples : 

- **intitle:index.of?avi game_of_thrones_S01E01**

EDITÂ² : ~~Actually I got an idea : Any programmer capable of building an extension (for chrome or firefox) based on that trick ? Like adding a option to the right-click menu when a text is selected ? Would be awesome~~

FINAL EDIT : Big thanks to /u/RitchieThai for the chrome extension, you can find it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-file-of-selection/nbicdolenaldneehppakaedkhbboeben). There is a [bookmarket version](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2586l9/ysk_you_can_find_and_download_anything_song/chetrhs) of this trick if you prefer.
