LPT: If possible, take 1-2 days off before returning to work after a long vacation. It can help you decompress, get back into your normal routine, &amp; ease the stress of returning back to work

I’ve always been a hoarder of PTO, and rushed into getting back to work without having to waste PTO days. On my latest trip I decided to take two full days off before returning back to work. This allowed me to get back into my normal routine, get all my post-vacay chores done, and left me feeling refreshed and ready to get back on the work grind.

Edit: Since there’s been a lot of questions, my definition of a ‘long’ vacation is 7 PTO days off, so really a 9-10 day trip total. I used PTO that I earned for working non stop for 2.5 years straight without taking time for a real vacation.
