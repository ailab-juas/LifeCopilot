LPT: Next time your kid tells you "I'm bored", hear instead "I want to go on adventure with you"

content:
I grew up hearing something along the lines of "Being board is your choice, do something about it". When my kid started saying this I had to fight my instincts to react in kind and instead started suggesting treasure hunts, games, etc.  I feel they learned ways to entertain themselves and as a bonus I got to spend sometime with them which was a fleeting experience.
