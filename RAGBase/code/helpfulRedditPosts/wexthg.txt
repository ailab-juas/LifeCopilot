YSK: Roadtrip Edition

content:
Why YSK: These are common items that my family, friends, and I have picked up over the years that have come to make roadtrips far less stressful. Mostly focused on interstate travel. 

\-------

**General information**

* Keep a small trashcan in your car. You'll be surprised just how often you use it.
* If you have a moon/sun roof, opening it and the right-rear window will create a nice draft on the driver's neck.
* Whenever possible, roll down your window and turn off the radio.
* Keep enough cash hidden in your vehicle to pay for gas home + $50. If you lose your wallet/purse then you've still got enough money to get home. The extra $50 is for food/repairs if your window gets broken.
* Turn on your hazards temporarily anytime you have to brake hard due to a sudden change in traffic conditions or if you're the last person in a line of slow/stopped traffic. This lets the person behind you know to slow down early.
* Always physically turn on your headlights at night. Daytime running lights can be bright enough to see the road in the city but without your taillights on, your vehicle becomes a hazard to other drivers.
* Have excellent floormats. In an emergency you will have mud/debris on your shoes and there's a peace of mind that comes from knowing you don't have to clean your carpet later.
* Download offline maps onto your phone.
* Keep your windshield clean and invest in silicone windshield wipers. Using a product like Rain-X will also help tremendously in bad weather, but will also make it easier to clean bugs off your windshield.
* Don't panic. It's better to miss an exit than cut across multiple lanes of traffic.
* ALWAYS assume that the driver of every car around you is distracted.
* If you're tired, pull over and rest even if it's just for 5 minutes. Try to find a well lit area like a gas station.
* Don't cut off a semi. There is a high probability that you will be in a blind spot and if you have to brake suddenly your vehicle will barely slow them down. Similarly, don't tailgate bikers, they can stop faster than you and you'll be at fault. 
* Use low beam headlights in all precipitation, especially fog and snow.
* If you start sliding, make very slight adjustments to the steering wheel. It's far too easy to overcorrect.
* On the interstate or any other multi-lane highways, the vehicles entering must yield to current traffic. If you can move over, do so. However if you cannot, don't brake. Odds are that they will brake too and it will cause a ripple effect to the traffic behind you
* Manually downshift your car if you're going down a steep grade. This will automatically slow your vehicle and prevent your brakes from overheating.
* Oncoming traffic flashes their headlights. If it's nighttime and you're sure your headlights are already on, this is a warning and you should slow down and look for wildlife, police, or other impediments.  
* Vehicle behind you flashes their headlights. You should move out of the fast lane. DON'T slow down or stay in the passing lane. While this might seem rude initially, you don't know what the other driver's situation is and moving out of the lane takes little effort. If it's nighttime and the car remains behind you, before calling 911 double check that your headlights are on. 
* Drive in the right lane as often as you can unless overtaking another vehicle. Congestion is primarily caused by vehicles staying in the center or passing lanes even when they're not overtaking another vehicle.
* If you have a dashcam, read out the license plate number along with make/model of a vehicle if you get into an accident or see an accident. It's also good to narrate what is happening just in case the camera shifts and doesn't pick up the scene.
* Edit to add: When you encounter road rage, follow George Carlin's advice. "Think of how stupid the average person is, then realize that half of all people are dumber than that". If someone gets aggressive on the roadway, let them "win" and move on. Being flipped off/yelled at is far better than getting into an accident. If they get extremely aggressive drive call 911, explain the situation and drive to the nearest police station.
* Edit2 to add: Remember that everyone you meet is just trying to get through their day. Clerks, police, wait staff, homeless, etc. Genuine enthusiasm is infectious, but don't be obnoxious. Be intentionally respectfulful. Some of my best memories/experiences have come from idle banter with a local.

**Keep the following items in your car:**

* Travel pillow and an eye mask. If you're tired and need some quick rest, you'll want to be in a well lit area.
* Car jack, spare tire, lugnut wrench, cheater bar (pipe that can slip over the handle of the lugnut wrench).
   * If you don't know how to change a tire, here's the basics: remove the spare tire and jack from the vehicle, find the piece of thick folded metal along the underside of the car, jack up the car just enough to put tension on the jack, slightly loosen the lugnuts (tire still on the ground), jack up the car high enough to put on a fully inflated tire, loosen the lugnuts the rest of the way, take the tire off (you might have to mule kick it), put the spare on, put the lugnuts on using an "every other" or star configuration (this prevents the wheel from catching on the threads), lower the jack until the tire touches the ground, tighten the lugnuts again using a star pattern, remove the jack, tighten the lugnuts once again using the star pattern.
* Jumper cables or a battery pack that can jumpstart a car. Red to red, black to black.
* A gallon of water. This can be used to drink or to put in the radiator if your car overheats
* Zip ties. You'll use them.
* Change of clothes, toiletries, and a towel.
* Gloves
* Dashcam - ideally one for the front and back    
* Tire gauge and compressor (electric or manual)
* First aid kit
* Hi-Vis vest    
* Toenail clippers. They're perfect for opening bags, trimming loose threads, splinters, prying, etc
* Pen   
* Umbrella     
* Napkins/wet wipes

**Personal Rules**

* If at all possible, never return using the same route.
* If someone sees something that they want to check it out, we stop. If we never get to our destination because we've taken too much time seeing other things, that's ok.
