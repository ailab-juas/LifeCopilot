LPT: After medical procedure or having a baby, use a trial week for a home delivery food service.

content:
My wife and I had a baby a few months back. This was our third kid so we had all of the stuff we needed for the baby. So, instead of a regular gift, a few of our friends got together and signed us up for one of the food delivery services for a few weeks (trial period plus a couple of weeks paid by the friends). It made the transition so much easier and was one less to worry and stress about. Food just showed up and we had to do limited work to eat. We have phased off of it as we adjusted to the changes (not to mention they can get pricey),but Iâ€™d definitely consider something similar in the future as a gift to others or for another time when mobility is limited for health reasons and not to just rely on fast food delivery.
