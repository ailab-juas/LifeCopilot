LPT: When applying for a job, use previous class syllabus objectives to show the skill sets you have learned.

content:
Just recently, it dawned on me that many of my professors have been helping me explain my skill sets through their study guides &amp; syllabus. Every syllabus explains the objectives a student will learn by the end of the class. Use these objectives to showcase your skill set when applying for a job.

* "Calculating NPV to assess which projects are most profitable"

* "Preparing a departmental contributory income statement"

* "Understanding of film ultimates, tax credits and how vertical integration can increase profit margins"

[edit]: 

1. Write the objectives in your own words.
1. Be ready to explain your skill set during an interview
1. Know how to practically use the objectives to the job your applying for.
