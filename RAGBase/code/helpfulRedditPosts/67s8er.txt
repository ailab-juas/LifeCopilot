title:
LPT: Tell your parents/grandparents to call your phone number immediately if they ever get a call saying that you need money.

content:
Scammers will call older people and try to make it sound like their son/daughter is in trouble and they need some amount of money wired to a weird address. By having them call your phone number if they ever get a call like this, it will prevent them from losing money or having their identity stolen.
