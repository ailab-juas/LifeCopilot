LPT: When house shopping carry a small UV flashlight with you

content:
When you're shopping for a house, shine a UV flashlight on the carpet. Anything that shows up bright is likely dog or cat urine. The carpet may LOOK good but under UV you'll be able to tell if they had a puppy who had a lot of accidents. Use it as a bargaining chip to get the price down and get new carpet. 

Edit: I get that you SHOULD replace the carpet when you buy a new house, but not everybody has the money to do that right away. If it's "good enough" people will leave it until they can afford it. 

Also, in seller's markets you're screwed. In buyers markets it's a different story - you can get people to knock the price down for a lot of stuff.
