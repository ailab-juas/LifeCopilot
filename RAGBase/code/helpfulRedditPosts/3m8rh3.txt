LPT: College students, got a loose-leaf textbook you hate? Go to the copy center at Staples and ask for it to be bound. Approximately $6 for a decent book that won't fall apart!

The name brand for the binding system is Coverbind. If the book won't fit within the cover, ask if they can trim the excess off the inside margin (the max Coverbind was 8 1/2x 11" at my Staples). I'm not sure if other office supply stores do this, so make sure to look around. Enjoy!
