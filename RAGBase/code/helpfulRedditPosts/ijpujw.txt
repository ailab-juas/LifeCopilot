title:
LPT when an elderly parent or grandparent tells you a story multiple times, act like you are hearing it for the first time.

content:
My Gram is getting up there in age and her memory is really starting to go. I call her every week and she has begun telling me the same stories over and over again.

At first, I would correct her and tell her she already had told me the story. Eventually I realized it was making her upset. She felt bad that she couldn't remember what we had talked about last week and it really stressed her out that she was having memory problems. So I began to act like it's the first time I'm hearing the story. 

I ask different questions about it and get more details. If she is telling me about it multiple times then it must be because it's one of her favorite memories. I like helping her remember these things. 

I call my Gram to make her happy. If that means I gotta hear the same story a few times then that's okay by me. She's an absolute angel and I'm just happy to talk to her. 

INFO: Dementia runs in the family and that's why my Gram gets so stressed about losing her memory. She gets tested for it every year and she is always fine. We were told being forgetful was a normal part of aging.
