LPT: When making homemade fries, after slicing the potato, soak the slices in a bowl of cold water. Some of the starches will release into the water, which makes the inside of the fries tender while the outside remains crispier.

content:
Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water, then allow them to soak for two or three hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak for several hours or overnight.) When you're ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay them on two baking sheet lined with paper towels.
