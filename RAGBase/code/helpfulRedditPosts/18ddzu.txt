LPT: How to make sure that your ball pen keeps writing after a long period of time, without any line breaks in your hand writing, sliding and other visible defects. 

content:
When you write, you naturally put your hand on the notebook/paper. If you are copying class notes or anything similarly important, it might take you hours and it is important to keep going. 

I always get annoyed when the pen stops writing, but not because its out of ink, it just starts to sort of slide, but it won't write. The ink simply won't come out. 

**LPT:** *put a piece of paper underneath your hand, to make sure that your arm does not rest on the exact same paper you're writing on*. See, when your hand comes into contact with the paper, it transfers some of the natural grease and minerals, which cover our skin. The ball inside of the pen simply starts to slide on top of that grease, not revolving, thus not getting more ink out. 

This isn't based on any research or anything. This is just my observation from college years. 

**TL;DR:** put a piece of paper under your writing hand to make sure that the hand does not come into contact with the paper you're writing on. The paper is less filthy and prevents pen sliding. 

**Edit:** I'm glad that some people found this to be useful! Keep writing:)

Also, yes I'm aware of laptops and other useful tech, but sometimes it just feels like you want to actually write something down instead of typing. 

Plus, hand writing is good for your brain, while typing isn't that much - sources: [&lt;1&gt;](http://www.educationnews.org/technology/research-handwriting-spurs-brain-activity-typing-doesnt/), [&lt;2&gt;](http://teachingislearning.com/writing-by-hand-is-good-for-your-brain/)

**Edit 2:** many people suggest - fountain pens as an option; also pressurized pens; - as alternatives. This LPT might also be useful for people who draw, as suggested by [Mortensen](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mortensen), to  keep your sketches nice and clean. 

**Edit 3:** As suggested by some lefties - we should all just need to learn left handed writing! Problem solved:) Also - Leftie Pro Tip - cracked me up:)
