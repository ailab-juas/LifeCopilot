title:
LPT Expand ALL acronyms on first usage.

content:
I see this often. People expect others to know what they are talking about and don’t expand acronym. Why?
Two of my favourites I’ve seen lately:
MBT… Main battle tank (how would anyone get to that?)
BBL… Brazilian butt lift.

Expand the acronyms people.

Smooth brains, you need to post LPT in the title to get the post approved as a…LPT 🫠🧐
