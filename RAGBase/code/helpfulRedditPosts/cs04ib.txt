YSK you don’t HAVE to use the amount of a product recommended by the label/commercial.

content:
Companies greatly benefit from overuse of their product. If you use twice as much, you’ll run out twice as fast, you buy twice as much. This can be applicable to toothpaste, handsoap, detergent, etc. anything where the consumer controls the amount. 

This flips with products that have fixed amounts, like wash pods. Now the companies use as little as possible to do the thing it has to do. 

I guess we can learn from the companies and use as little as possible and still get the desired result. 

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

Edit: people raise a good point. This is not applicable with medication, vitamins and other supplements. Always consult your doctor for the proper dosage.

Edit2: All this talk about pop tarts. As a non-American, I need to try these. That’s going on my bucket list!
