YSK: If you aren't bothered about what's done with your body post-mortem, companies exist that offer to use your remains to grow a tree of your choosing.

I posted this on LPT, but it was (understandably) removed.

Essentially, there are a handful of companies that offer to use your remains as fertilizer for a tree seed. The cost of this is substantially less than a typical funeral, and, when compared to a sealed metal casket housing embalming fluid, it is far better for the environment.

Please do not mistake this for advertising; Bios Urn is one of these services that I discovered recently. There are others, including services that will turn you into a coral reef instead, but the aforementioned company is simply an example of the concept described in this post.

It's something to consider if you don't have strong beliefs about how your body should be handled after death.

EDIT: Wow, this got some attention. I would like to address a recurrent comment; I am not advocating to do this INSTEAD of donating your organs, and I would hope people commenting don't believe I'm suggesting people choose this over organ donation. Post-donation, you still have remains, and I believe this is something to consider for said remains.
