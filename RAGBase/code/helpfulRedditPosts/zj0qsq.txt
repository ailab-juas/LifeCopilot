YSK:When buying a holiday meal bundle, always double check if the food comes cooked or frozen.

content:
Why YSK: after working in a deli, restaurants, food delivery etc. I run into sooo many people who thought they were ordering a cooked turkey, dessert,  etc when really they were expected to cook it at home. Some places definitely do sell Thanksgiving meals fully cooked but always make sure that's the case!!
