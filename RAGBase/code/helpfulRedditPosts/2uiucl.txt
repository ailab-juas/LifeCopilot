YSK: If you plan on ordering flowers from ProFlowers.com, they have leaked users' information to phishers/spammers in the past

content:
I received spam/malware emails to an address that no company other than ProFlowers.com had ever been given. 

Aside from their product being not very good in my opinion, they also don't take their users' security seriously.
