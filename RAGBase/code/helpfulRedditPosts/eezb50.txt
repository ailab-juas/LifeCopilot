title:
YSK: Never Try To Stop A Robbery.

content:
At least in the US, stores are insured, banks -and your money in that bank- are insured, almost everything that can be robbed can be insured, and probably is. If you're a witness to a robbery, you need to observe, not act. What's important is your safety. Don't risk your life for an insurance company. I know everyone wants to be a hero, but escalating the situation to violence is a lot worse than just letting an insurance company do the job that the business is paying for.
