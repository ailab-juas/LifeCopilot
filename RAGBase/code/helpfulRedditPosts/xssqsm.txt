LPT: When discussing salary at a prospective new job - don’t be afraid to negotiate! Most companies have a range of salaries they are willing to pay for your position.

content:
My company, for example, has a salary range of 80-120% for all positions.

I didn’t know that going in to my new role, but I was able to negotiate a much higher ($10,000+) salary simply by asking for x amount more to “reflect rising expenses due to inflation”.

The worst they could possibly say is no!
