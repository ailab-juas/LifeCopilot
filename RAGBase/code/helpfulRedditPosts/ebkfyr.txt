YSK that buying a real Christmas tree is almost always environmentally better than buying a fake one.

content:
There are a lot of reasons for this. The biggest misconception people have is that buying a real tree contributes to deforestation. This is wrong. Christmas trees are grown on farms just like any other crop, not harvested from an existing forest. And most Christmas trees take up to a decade to grow, so for any one tree you buy there are about 9 others growing in rotation (or more), which means Christmas tree farms provide a net benefit to air quality and wildlife.

And if you want to increase your environmentalism even more this holiday season, consider buying from a local farm. The shorter the tree has to travel, the better. And after the holidays, google some fun and creative ways that you can recycle or repurpose your tree with organizations around your town. You'd be surprised at what a Christmas tree can be used for!
