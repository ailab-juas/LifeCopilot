LPT: If you are just starting at the gym and doing cardio, set a distance limit and not a time limit

content:
If you say you'll run for 10 minutes you may find yourself going slower and walking towards the end. Even worse for machines you control the speed of (rowing and cycling). 

Set a distance and make a mental note of a time you want to beat. The less you work the longer it takes.
