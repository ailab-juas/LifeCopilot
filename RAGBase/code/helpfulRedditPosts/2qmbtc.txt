title:
LPT: Do not feed your dog by dropping food to the floor

content:
Train your dog to only take food out of your hand, or out of a bowl.  The reason why is that if a dog is conditioned to see you drop food and then they excitedly snatch it up, things can get very bad if you should accidentally drop medicine or other object which is unsafe for them.
