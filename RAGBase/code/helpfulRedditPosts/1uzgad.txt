YSK that it is a huge fire hazard to throw out fireplace/wood stove ashes in the garbage no matter how long the fire has been out.

content:
I have been a firefighter for almost 7 years and year after year we respond to house fires due to the improper disposal of fireplace ashes.

In my just town there have been 3 fires this year alone that have been the result of fire ashes though to be out discarded in trashcans.

NEVER PUT YOU ASHES IN A FLAMMABLE CONTAINER!

No matter how long the fire has been out, there still could be an ember in there capable of igniting what ever it touches.

My advice if you have a fire place/ wood burning stove is to buy a metal pail and the old style (oscar the grouch style) garbage cans. 

Use the metal pail to move the ashes to the metal garbage can. 

Keep the metal can quite a distance away from your house. I would say at least 10 ft and keep that can away from anything flammable like a shed or fence. That insures that if a fire was the fare up, it would just involve the metal can's contents and nothing else. Also do not throw anything other than ashes in this garbage can. I would spray the ashes down with water every time new ashes are added and leave the lid off when it rains/snows to help insure extinguishment. 

After a lot of time has passed, you can bag up the ashes and leave them at the curb or use them for compost. 

I know that this may seem overkill, but I have seen this all too often in my short time as a firefighter.

I hope that helps someone! If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask.
