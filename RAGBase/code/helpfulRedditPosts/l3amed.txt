YSK : If you find Indian food spicy, you should order Raita along with it

content:
Raita is curd mixed with some spices, chopped onions and Boondi(small gram flour puff balls)

Why YSK ?
 
People on Internet always say that they find Indian food too spicy despite them liking it then you should definitely order Raita also with your Indian curry

Raita should ease of the hotness of dishes you are eating

Here in INDIA(especially North India), Raita is a must have with your food even when you are in your home and one thing people in restaurants always order.

Just take a bite of your curry and then take a spoonful of Raita after and it makes a delicious combination.
