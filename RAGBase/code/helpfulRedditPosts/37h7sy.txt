LPT: You can turn Youtube videos into .gifs just by adding 'gif' to the beginning of the URL.

content:
 Add *'gif'* before *'youtube.com/[...]'* and after *'www.'*;  

Example:
 &gt;www .**gif**youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ   

This will bring you to a editor, there you can edit the length of your gif among other things. Then click 'create gif'. After that, rightclick the resulting image and click 'GIF LINK' (this will copy your new cool gif to the clipboard).   
  
[Result](http://share.gifyoutube.com/Kdj3RQ.gif)     

Have fun!
