LPT: If you're looking for a nice wallpaper for your device, you can go onto the MET museum's website which has high quality digital copies of art that you can download.

content:
Their digital collection is awesome. They have a really nice search function that you can use if you're looking for something specific too. Some works aren't available for download but a lot of them are public domain. There's no ads or popups when you download, and it's completely free!

Edit: sorry I didn't include the link lol here's the website
