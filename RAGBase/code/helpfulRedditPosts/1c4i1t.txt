LPT: Posture problems while on the computer? Tilt your computer screen upwards so you have to sit straight.

content:
I thought of this while sitting hours on the computer doing some statistics with excel. It's working pretty well for me; sometimes I get lazy and I slouch a bit but it's a good reminder to sit straight since it allows you to see your computer screen better. Hope it helps. 

EDIT 1: Firstly, thanks a lot for all the attention, I never received so many upvotes on a post. Secondly, I found great pleasure in reading all your comments and I look forward to properly updating this LPT with the 135 degree slant once I get home. 

EDIT 2: ~~Wow, front page!~~ This is really cool! Thanks a lot everyone; I really appreciate everyone's feedback. Back to business though, reading through the comments made me realize that the 'perfect' posture has still yet to be found. There is no consensus, or so it seems, as to what the perfect posture should be. I made this LPT because all the chiropractors I've visited told me to sit as straight as possible while on the computer. I'm sorry if this turns out to be misleading information. All I know is that it's helping my scoliosis--it's very, very mild, it caused me no noticeable problems, and the doc said I just need to watch my posture--and I hope it will help a lot of you. Cheers to all from Rome, Italy.
