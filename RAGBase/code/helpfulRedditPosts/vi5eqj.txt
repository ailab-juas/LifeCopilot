LPT: If you care about gender equality, corruption, climate change, human rights, animal welfare, weapon industry, etc., one of the easiest and most impactful ways to try to make the world a better place is to switch to a different bank.

Banks use the money on your accounts to invest in all kinds of things and run their company a certain way. Here in the Netherlands I recently came across a website that compares banks on themes like labor rights, climate change, animal welfare, weapon industry, gender equality, human rights, corruption, transparency and more topics. After a quick comparison I switched banks and the services and terms are (almost) identical, so it didn't affect my personal life at all. I'm sure many countries have these kind of comparison tools.

Edit: 
Since many people asked, here is the link to the website I used https://eerlijkegeldwijzer.nl/bankwijzer/banken/ It's in Dutch and only for banks in the Netherlands.

Here is a link https://bank.green/ someone listed in the comments where you can see for banks from loads of different countries (I don't know how reliable it is for each country) how green they; what their impact on climate change is.

Here is a link https://www.fossilbanks.org/fossil-banks someone listed where you can see how much some banks have invested in the fossil fuel industry, since they signed the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Here is a video by the YT channel Climate Town regarding this topic, which many people linked in the comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ7W6HFHPYs
