LPT for people who watch Netflix on their laptops: Load it in Internet Explorer or Safari to get 1080p. Google Chrome will only play in 720p.

I found this out a few weeks ago but with Orange is the New Black out today I figure it's more relevant now.

Edit: I did not expect this to get so many upvotes. I'm glad this was useful advice! Thanks to whoever gilded me also. 

A lot of people are asking about FF, I don't know but I think 720 also. I also have no idea why I said laptop, not desktop (or better yet, computer). It doesn't matter, we're all in the PC Master Race. 

Oh, and as people have pointed out, if you're on Windows 8/8.1 and you don't mind watching in full screen without clicking onto other tabs, the Netflix App on the windows store will play in 1080p/5.1. 

Tbh, Netflix need to get 4K PC support and sort out these chrome issues. 

Now everyone stop commenting and go digest some OitnB in glorious 1080.
