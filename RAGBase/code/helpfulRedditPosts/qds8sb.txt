YSK: if you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, try sleeping with your curtains open.

Why YSK: Getting good sleep is essential for a healthy day to day life. As someone who slept terribly for a few years, this small tip helped me out immensely.

During my college years, i slept in a room with no windows. Pitch black. I'd wake up at 6am every morning feeling like i had been hit by a truck and it would take me pretty much half of the morning to get my brain going. After that, i moved and had a bedroom with one window over my bed. Out of lazyness, i started sleeping with the curtains open and over time noticed i slept better, woke up fresher and not feeling as heavy as before. I looked it up and basically what happens is that the gradual increase in the level of light in the room will stop the melatonin production in your brain, essentially making you less sleepy over time, even while you are still asleep, so you don't jump from deep sleep state to awake. This will help you get out of bed easier and up and running much faster. Here's a short article on how to sleep better: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/how-to-get-the-perfect-nights-sleep/amp/

I hope someone finds this useful. For me it was a game changer. Everyone's sleep is different, so give it a try, you've got nothing to lose :)
