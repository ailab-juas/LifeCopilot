LPT: For cheaper hotel rooms search use a hotel discount website to find a room then contact the hotel directly.

content:
Use sites like Trivago,lastminute and so on to find hotels at a deal price, then contact the hotel directly and offer them slightly less than the advertised price. The deal sites can take up to 30% of the booking fee so you and the hotel both save, you can sometimes just ask them to throw in a evening meal or breakfast for free.
