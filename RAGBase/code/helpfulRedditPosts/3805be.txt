LPT: GMAIL Inbox tips.

content:
Hi, I searched previously tips posted here, but there are a few tips which were,IMHO, missing.

* **Stars**

Under the *General* tab is *Settings* you can choose the no. of stars you want to apply to your emails. There are 12 different kind of options available,which can be used for different purposes.
For example: A red star for emails that need your attention, yellow which needs discussion, blue ones are waiting for your reply and so on..

* **Right Side Chat**

This is the second best feature (*After UNDO, of course*) which will magically create space on the left side of your inbox, giving better visibility to your Labels and stuff. 

Also, now, your chat is shifted to RHS and thus can display contacts in a larger window. Better and larger view.

* You're all aware about the Undo thing, and to add it, you can generalise the sending cancellation time in **GENERAL** tab.


* The *Shift+?* will show you all the keyboard short-cuts, which are there and if they are enabled or disabled.
