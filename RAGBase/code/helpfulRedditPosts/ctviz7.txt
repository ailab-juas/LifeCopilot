title:
YSK that if you have an ant infestation that Saccharine, and Aspartame found in artificial sweeteners will kill off most ant nests because theres no nutrition and ants will starve.

content:
Flour and Outmeal work somewhat as well by sucking all the moisture out of the ants and dehydrating them to the point of death.

Edit: if you are opposed to starving them check the comments. There are tons of good examples of other ways of ridding yourself of them
