YSK: That feeding wildlife is harmful to their well-being and that wild animals who are friendly/cute with humans are NOT a good thing

content:
Sort of off my chest reaction here but so many people are defending Tiger King recently and saying that "he loved his tigers" and "they should have just let him be!"

Similarly, so many arm-chair wildlife conservationists LOVE those videos where a girl is petting a cute Gray Wolf or Grizzly Bear or whatever the fuck.

People need to know that a friendly wild animal is a losing one. There is nothing 'cute' about a wild Gray Wolf cuddling up with a person... it's sad. There are MANY reasons why feeding/normalizing human interactions with wildlife negatively effects their species.

Not only does that get them too comfortable with approaching humans/roadways/other potentially dangerous areas. But most of the food people feed wild animals is horrible for them.

I've gotten into SO many debates with people on here about that. So many people think that feeding a wild deer is "helping it" and that sustainable hunting is "hurting" a species.

An animal that gets too used to people and depending on people for food is literally fucked if it were to be released into the wild. This is why wildlife rehab operations will sort of 'manhandle' the animals and not cuddle up and give them 'love'.

Non-domesticated wildlife does NOT need cuddles.

Please people, educate yourselves!
