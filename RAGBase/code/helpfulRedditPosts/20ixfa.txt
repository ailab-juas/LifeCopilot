LPT: Suffer a lot from canker sores? Avoid toothpastes with sodium dodecyl sulfate.

content:
This is from personal experience. I used to constantly suffer from canker sores, I hated eating spicy food since it would always hurt my mouth and would be extra careful when chewing because I thought that I was constantly biting myself. 

I decided to search for remedies and one of the most common ones I came across was to avoid toothpastes with sodium dodecyl sulfate. It's a stupid foaming agent that does exactly that...foam, to create the illusion of the toothpaste doing a thorough cleaning... That's all it does. 

I switched to sodium dodecyl sulfate free toothpaste and within a month all my canker sores were gone, this was almost 3 years ago.

A couple of weeks back I decided I wanted to try one of those 'whitening' toothpastes, and decided to only use it at night. I kept using my other toothpaste in between meals. Well, the canker sores are back and my whitening toothpaste is in the trash now. This is what prompted me to post this.

Hope it helps someone out there. 

**Edit:**

It's more commonly listed as Sodium laureth sulfate, apparently they are the same thing. Just avoid those two.
