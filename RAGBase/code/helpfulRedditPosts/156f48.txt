LPT: How to keep Jehovah's Witnesses from coming back to your home. (From a former JW)

content:
1. Tell them you want to be placed on the **Do Not Call** list. Every Congregation has a record of those who ask not to be called on entitled the "Do Not Call List". This buys you at least a year, sometimes more. Eventually 2 older men will come back to call again in case you have changed your mind or there are new owners.

2. Hang a **No Trespassing** sign. *NOT* a "No Soliciting" sign as Witnesses are instructed that those do not apply to them "since they are technically not soliciting." However, they are specifically instructed to avoid entering property with a "No Trespassing" sign because it can bring legal troubles and the Watchtower Society will not help out in that case should a situation arise.


BONUS: 

- Tell them you are **Disfellowshipped/Disassociated** and they will back away from you like Satan himself.

- Dress up like **Satan** himself.

- **Beware of Dog** signs are pretty effective.

- EDIT: Actually, pretty brilliant suggestion from u/tophatmcmonocle: Hang a Do Not Disturb sign on your door.

And just a sidenote, they are good people that think they're doing the right thing...and I have had my fair share growing up as one of having doors slammed in my face, hit with canes, guns pulled, etc. and I can assure you most of them don't want to be there any more than you want them to be there but they have to be...so be kind just one last time before you tell them to never come back.

EDIT: [/r/exjw](/r/exjw) for anyone who has questions or curiosities. Even better, any Witnesses that want to have a polite discussion...please stop by and have a chat.

EDIT 2: So, this is starting to turn into an AMA and there's been several requests for one. Here's an AMA for anyone interested: [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/156oxv/as_requested_i_am_a_jehovahs_witness_trying_to/)
