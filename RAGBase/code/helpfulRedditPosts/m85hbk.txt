YSK that for over 50% of the United States population, the combination of someone's 5-digit zip code, gender, and date of birth is unique to only one person. Be careful with the information you share online-- it's more identifiable than you think.

Why YSK:

We often underestimate how much information we're really sharing online.  It might not feel like we're identifying ourselves by sharing a few generic pieces of information about ourselves.  But given just how easily identifiable we become after sharing just a few pieces of information, it might be worth reconsidering what you share (or are truthful about) online.

Edit: Date of birth includes the year.  A lot of people have been trying to work out the math.  If you're interested in digging deeper, please check out the source I linked.
