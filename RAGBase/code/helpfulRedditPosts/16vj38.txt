LPT - When boarding/deplaning, wear your backpack in reverse - like you're pregnant.

content:
*Many of the hazards of carry-ons can be avoided by packing in a great backpack.*

**When you're getting on and off an airplane, put your backpack on backwards.**  Wear it like you were wearing a fake pregnancy prosthetic (like on the weekends).  This will allow you to not crash into peoples faces when turning to look at your seat and not have to pull your pack up and over someone when getting ready to sit down.

It will come off quickly and easily to be stowed under your seat before you buckle in.

Wow, front page. Glad it was a good tip.
