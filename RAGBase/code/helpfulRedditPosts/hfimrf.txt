LPT: If you struggle with self confidence do this exercise: observe people in public and imagine what they would want to be complimented on. Then compliment them in your head.

My world changed after I started doing this on my bus commute. Thinking “That’s hair color looks great!” or “Man, you must work out!” just made me so happy and after a while I started feeling like others look at me the same way.

It takes practice and it’s harder than having judgemental thoughts but much more rewarding.

Later I started complimenting some people out loud and they really love it!
