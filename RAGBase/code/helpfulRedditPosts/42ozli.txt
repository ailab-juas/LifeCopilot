LPT: If a dog's owner tries to stop them from jumping on you, begging for food from you, etc, don't insist that 'it's fine' and allow/encourage the dog to keep doing it. They're trying to train it, and you're really hindering the process.

content:
**FINAL EDIT: This is intended for those who go against the owner's plain, straightforward request that you not encourage the dog, and those who never thought of it this way.**

**And yes, the same DEFINITELY goes for kids. If they're not yours, don't teach them to do bad shit!**

**Sorry, I left out what you *should* do: Instead, you should disengage the dog altogether. Try to pretend she's not there until she does something good (usually settle down, sit, whatever) and then you can praise her. Or, you know, just listen to what the owner is telling you/asking of you. If you can't listen to a friend's simple requests, why the fuck do you have friends. And no, we're not going to keep our dogs away from all human beings until they're 100% trained. The fuck are you thinking?**

**This really isn't outlandish, this is pretty common sense. If you refuse to do this because you want to play with the dog however you want or you don't want to "help the stupid owner that can't train the dog right", that just makes you an asshole.**

It's very sweet of you to not make a big deal of it when a dog does something undesirable like jump or beg, and (I'm sure) all of us dog owners really appreciate it.

But when you ~~say "oh no no no please it's fine" and hold your arms out to greet/support the jump or just straight up feed them when they beg.....~~ encourage the bad behavior... What are you doing!! It's *THEIR* dog, if they want to train him not to jump, you should support that. **You are not signing a social contract by interacting with a person's dog. But you shouldn't undermine them and ignore their request that you not encourage the bad behavior.**

Encouraging the dog makes training really difficult and take much longer. They tend to not learn 'okay, I can jump with this one person but it's bad with everyone else', they just learn 'mom is mean and doesn't let me jump on her but *everyone else loves jumps!!!!'* So, my dear psychopaths, when you flip your shit over a dog jumping on you, just remember that it's the fault of your fellow psychopaths encouraging the jumping "because they're not training your fucking dog for you". 

Edit: lmao you people ~~make great friends~~ are fucking **psychopaths**. ~~"FUCK YOU AND YOUR DOG IF IT JUMPS ON ME"~~ *(insert death threat for posting a LPT/having a dog that jumps)*

Edit: ^ scroll to the lowest comments to be overwhelmed by psychopaths. I apologize for all the edits, but I'm not accustomed to a death threat per minute for trying to spread some common sense.
