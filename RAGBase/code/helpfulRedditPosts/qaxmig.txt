title:
LPT: Never accept a counter offer

content:
If you've quit because you accepted another job and you current employer offers you more money (or to match) do not accept.

They will always resent you for having one over them, and they will consider you as doing it only for the money {because no one should admit this}.

You have just proven yourself untrustworthy because you are going to back out of an offer already accepted elsewhere. 

You will miss out at the next pay increase 'because you just got a big one'.

And you will have burned the opportunity with you future employer.

Even if they beat the offer, go to the new opportunity..
