LPT: Going camping? Instead of buying a bag of ice for your cooler - fill a couple of empty half gallon OJ or milk containers with water and freeze it.

The block of ice will last longer and will not leak everywhere. It even fits nicely at the bottom of the cooler. I did it last weekend and 10/10 would recommend to anyone heading to the great outdoors for a weekend.
