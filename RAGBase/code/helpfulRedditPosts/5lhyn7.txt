LPT: if you are selling something and someone pays cash, count it in front of them and if you miscount, don't be afraid or embarrassed to count it again

Just sold a ring to someone and after negotiations settled on a decent price. $2550. They paid in 20s. I counted it in front of them but lost count with a handful of them left. I reasoned it was all therehowever because we had spent the better part of 2 hours with them and trusted them. I got back to my car and recounted, and found I was missing $150. If I had just said I screwed up and needed to recount it could've been solved it then and there. I called them and they claimed everything was there and there's no way to prove I didn't just take out the extra money. Lesson learned and thankfully with all things consdered I was only burned a little bit

UPDATE: called the buyer again and explained the situation more and she met up with me to give me the missing money. Thankfully some people are honest. All is well!
