LPT: If you’re allergic to mosquito bites like I am (they swell up a ton no matter how much you don’t scratch or irritate them and stay itching for days), dab on a little bit of rubbing alcohol with a soaked q-tip or application tool of your choice to the bite entrance as soon as you possibly can.

This legitimately works better and is cheaper than itching creams I have tried. Instant relief and keeps it from swelling up to the size of a half quarter like it normally does for me. Seriously try it if this is an issue for you, it has saved me so much pain and annoyance. Also, there are other symptoms to know if you’re allergic to mosquito bites, but I didn’t know I was because I always assumed everyone’s bites swelled and itched as much and for as long as mine.. turns out I’m just unlucky and allergic ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ So keep an eye out on yours as you may be unknowingly allergic as well!

Edit: Wow I did not expect my very first post to get this much traction! Thank you all for the interactions and for those of you who gave me my very first rewards &lt;3 I developed a pretty bad headache from being on my phone too much this morning in my dark room, so I’ll be taking a screen break for now lol I’m sorry for those of you that I didn’t get to reply to! I’ll be trying to reply later to those that I can :)
