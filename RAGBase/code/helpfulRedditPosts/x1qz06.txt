YSK not every animal on the street is a stray. Some might have a family at home missing them desperately.

Why YSK: you can help reunite them! Turns out this is not common knowledge, so I wanted to post. If you find a stray animal, *please* take them to any vet to get scanned for a microchip. If there’s no chip, and you can’t care for them, call your local humane society or ask the vet for more information.

Edit: guys I don’t mean to approach every stray. Just don’t keep one without checking first. If you are going to get involved, do it the right way.
