title:
LPT when paying for something in an airport, pay with a debit/credit card. If you drop/lose something, employees have a better chance of getting it back to you before you board your flight.

I work in an airport bar and my guests lose stuff all. The. Time. Yesterday, a guy paid in cash and boarded his flight to wherever and somehow dropped/forgot his house/car/whatever else keys and I had no way to figure out where he was by the time another guest picked them up off the floor and handed them to me. If you pay with a debit or credit card or even Apple Pay (But please, as a bartender/server, try to tip in cash!) we can use the restaurant copy we keep to get your name and have it announced throughout the airport to get your belongings back to you before itâ€™s too late. Another small tip is to always mention to the bartender where you are headed. If I knew where the guy was going I could narrow down my search by looking at the flight information boards. 


Happy traveling reddit.
