YSK: If you threaten violence against guys who might hurt your daughter/sister/female relative, there's a good chance that if a guy does hurt her, she won't tell you about it

content:
Why YSK:I know three different girls who have been abused by their boyfriends, and didn't tell their family about it. Their reason is that they don't want their protective older brothers/fathers/uncles to hurt the guy and end up in prison. You may think that by being overly protective you are helping your female relative, but there's a good chance you will just make her less likely to share her problems with the family.You can still be protective, just don't threaten to do things that may land you in serious trouble.
