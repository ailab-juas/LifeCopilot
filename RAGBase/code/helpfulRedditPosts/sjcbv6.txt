LPT: Learn common word choice mistakes and avoid them as much as possible. In any written communication, even if informal, these mistakes damage your credibility.

content:
These are all examples of things that make it past spell check, yet are wrong. Here are a few I've seen just today:

- Loose is the opposite of tight, lose is the opposite of win
- Lightning is electricity from the sky, lightening is to make something weigh less
- Diffuse is to spread something around, defuse is to deescalate a situation or disarm a bomb
- Your interest isn't peaked, it's piqued (unless you're interested in mountain ranges)
- You take a cue while acting, you queue to wait for something

What common word choice mistakes cause you to view the writer as less credible?
