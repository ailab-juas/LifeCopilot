LPT: How to make a bed to look like a hotel bed, and other various tips about your hotel room

content:
A few weeks ago I was hired at the Courtyard Marriot as a housekeeper and I saw some interest in how to make beds look as sharp as the ones in our hotels, so I'd like to walk you through the bed-making process!

You will need a:

-Fitted Sheet

-Flat Sheet

-Comforter

-Decorative Sheet

-2-4+ Pillows

-1 Decorative Pillow

-Bed Skirt (Optional)


1. Start with FRESH linens! http://i.imgur.com/dyapWiel.jpg

2. Throw your fitted sheet over the mattress. Doing diagonal corners first helps even it out and look smooth. Put the flat sheet over it and put it to the top of the bed. Put the comforter on over that, and lay it about 5-6 inches below the flat sheet: http://i.imgur.com/nSs7s4ol.jpg

Make sure there is enough room at the foot of the bed for the comforter to fold under the mattress. 

3. Lay the decorative sheet over the other sheets, making it end about right in between the comforter and flat sheet, the fold it about halfway down the bed on both sides: http://i.imgur.com/WXmd3qxl.jpg

4. Next take your flat sheet and fold it over the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/oSLz7jKl.jpg
 
5. Do the same thing to the comforter over the fold of the decorative sheet: http://i.imgur.com/sRV59Cnl.jpg 

6. Wrap the decorative sheet around the comforter and tuck under. This makes that nice looking design: http://i.imgur.com/sHU8lexl.jpg

7. At the bottom of the bed, pull the comforter and flat sheet like so: http://i.imgur.com/UkxExqTl.jpg

And fold it under so that it hangs over the bottom of the bed: http://i.imgur.com/UIHUWjKl.jpg

And repeat on the other side, tuck the entire end of the comforter under the bed. Make sure this is evenly proportioned and there is no unevenness. 

8. Take the decorative sheet and pull the opposite direction as you did the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/CBbyRTSl.jpg

Here is what it should look like: http://i.imgur.com/4uUSFail.jpg

9. Take your stripped pillows and put on fresh pillow sheets: http://i.imgur.com/egKl181l.jpg

10. Lay them on the bed, with the decorative pillow right over the blanket bunch: http://i.imgur.com/ltP0Z3vl.jpg

As you can see in these last picture, the bottom of the beds could be more proportionally tucked underneath, and the way you fold the decorative sheet makes an incredible difference in how the bed looks overall. So do the decorative tuck like I mentioned above and your bed will look quite ravishing! 


Now here are a few tips on your next hotel stay, and this may be specifically to the Courtyard Marriot but it is just a reference: 

-We ALWAYS clean the rooms, up and down, before you stay here. All sheets are fresh when you arrive, every single surface of your room has been sanitized. We even go on our hands and knees to manually wash the bathroom floors. You wouldn't believe how much people shed. Sorry if we miss a hair. 

-If you feel skeptical on your room being cleaned, check to see if there are any fingerprints on the toilet flusher.

-At the Courtyard Marriot we only refresh your sheets if you're staying for more than one day if you ask, otherwise we just make your bed up with the same sheets. 

-Last but not least, say hi to the housekeepers! We are the silent heroes of the hotel business and we really do our best to make your stay as inviting as possible. We do not cut corners, we work our asses off, and luckily for me, I love it. We rarely get tipped, but when we do it makes our entire day better knowing that people care about us as much as we care about you!

If you have any more questions on your hotel stays, ask away! 

And for some reason the numbers above start over if you inject a paragraph between them, sorry.
