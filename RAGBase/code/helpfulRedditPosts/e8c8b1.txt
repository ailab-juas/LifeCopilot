YSK skinny people can also be just as self-conscious as fat people

content:
I am very skinny myself being very underweight for my height.

My mom and one of my close friends constantly call me super skinny and it makes me feel bad about myself. I don't like being skinny and I plan to change it later.

While on a trip to the pool someone I knew but wasn't friends with came up to me and just said "you should eat more you're pretty skinny"

Nobody would go up to someone whose fat and say these things because they know they're probably self-conscious about it. But it's different for skinny people. They're skinny and therefore healthy.

Bottom line, everyone is self-conscious in their own way so don't go bothering people about it.
