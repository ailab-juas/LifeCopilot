LPT: Wake up earlier, your day will actually be better.

content:
This might be a no brainer for some but a lot of people, myself included, like to roll over and go back to sleep until the very last moment they need to wake up. For a week now I've been waking up an hour earlier than I need to, getting ready for the day, then relaxing by watching some tv or something before I need to leave. Getting up earlier is without a doubt why I don't feel rushed and anxious the rest of the day, as a student it helps me focus during class, and I generally have a more productive, less stressful day.
