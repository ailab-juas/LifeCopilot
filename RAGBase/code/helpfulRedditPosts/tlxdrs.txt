LPT: Refill your dogs water even if it’s not empty

content:
Dogs don’t like water when the bowl has been drank out of more than a few times. Their slober mixes with the water and totally changes the viscosity. They can sense this and they can tell the water isn’t fresh. Often times when I get my dogs fresh water (bowl wasn’t empty) they will come around and have a big drink and it makes me feel like a very conscientious pet owner. Some people don’t realize this.

EDIT
Those big auto filling dog bowls with the big jug are bad news. People use them for long periods and the slober never gets cleaned out :’(
