YSK NEVER to flush ANY wipes (baby, disinfectant, etc.), it will clog your septic system and do costly damage

Even the kind that claim to be 'flushable' aren't really, especially not on a massive scale like we're seeing right now as people turn to using them more than ever before.

Save yourself a very expensive visit from the plumber, and dispose of them in a trash bag. 

Better yet - use an alternative, these things are awful for the environment. Bidets for bathrooms, washable rags/old t-shirts for cleaning with are some ideas.

Edit: For those who still have doubts, please google "fatberg" and peruse the image results after reading detailed descriptions. Also, read the DOZENS of firsthand accounts in this very thread from sewer maintenance workers, plumbers, and others who have experienced the horror that can result from this.

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TRULY FLUSHABLE WIPES. Toilet paper is the only product designed to DISINTEGRATE fully.

Just because it goes down your toilet bowl and vanishes before your eyes, doesn't mean it's all good. The reason companies market "flushable" wipes is because there's no law preventing them from doing so, and clearly, there ought to be.
