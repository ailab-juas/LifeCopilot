LPT: Don't say X is better than Y. Say that you prefer X over Y.

content:
**EDIT:** All I mean is that we should be more wary of labelling things as better/worse because in most cases, they both have advantages and disadvantages. **For me the advantages of one thing may outweigh its  disadvantages, but for someone else it could be the other way around.**

**We should always try to think of things in a nuanced and complex way**, rather than just putting them under overly simple and vague categories like 'good' and 'bad'.

**EDIT 2:** Of course facts are facts. I haven't stated otherwise. The problem is when someone expresses an uninformed opinion as if it were a fact. Some people then latch on to that idea and in turn spread it. Ignorance like this is spread by people not thinking critically.

Saying that X *is* better than Y is masking your opinion as a fact. People are more inclined to believe something if it is stated matter-of-factly, so when X *in fact* is not better than Y, we have a problem.

**EDIT 3:** CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING

**EDIT 4:** SOME apples are better than other apples, but NO apples are better than oranges. 
I, however, prefer apples to oranges.

**EDIT 5:** As /u/beatakai said, "Something isn't necessarily the best, just your favorite. Phrasing it as such allows people to be more receptive instead of feeling alienated because they disagree."

And as /u/JacKaL_37 said, " (...) a lot of people talk STRICTLY in "x is better than y" form, rather than admitting their biases and saying "well, I like x better..."
You are biased. You don't have access to universal truths. Better to hedge against that than to argue about which fucking Spiderman movie "IS THE BEST" for an hour, when all you meant to say was "I like one better." 

And also as /u/Wikiwakagiligala said, [when talking about good/bad music] "There is no way to measure how good music is aside from popularity. It is relative to the ear, what is popular now will sound terrible in 50 years. Therefore it all comes down to preference."

And a clarfication from /u/jo3, "OP's point is simple: don't drive unnecessary wedges between you and other humans by stating your opinions as facts when they're clearly just opinions. 

Or put it like /u/Jahonay and say, "X is better than Y *when it comes to Z*. E.g Calzones are better than pizza when you want something more filling"
