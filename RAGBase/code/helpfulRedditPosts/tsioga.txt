LPT: Do not underestimate the power of buying yourself (men, mainly) flowers or plants that make your place smell nice and make you feel good.

I’m a man in my mid-30’s, and I love having flowers at home. I can’t quite describe it, but everything is better with flowers around. The smells, the colours, they’re soothing, relaxing and I feel help me think and focus. Try buying yourself a bunch next time you see them, or getting a plant that flowers and smells good. See if it improves your mood :)

Edit: whoa, they’re just flowers, guys :P the replies have made my day! Thank you for the silver, kind person!

Big Flower thanks you /s (just in case…)
