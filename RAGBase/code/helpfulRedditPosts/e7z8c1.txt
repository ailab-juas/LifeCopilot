YSK that palm oil is in many products such as Nutella and Peanut Butter, and palm oil is a reason for deforestation

content:
Palm Oil is in lots of products, such as Nutella and Peanut Butter, and Palm Oil is unfortunately gained by deforestation, and therefore is destroying homes of wildlife and even a cause of global warming. There are products which have used alternatives to Palm Oil which can be found with a quick Google search.

Edit: Yes Palm Oil is manufactured on plantations but the land for these plantations is a cause for deforestation

Edit 2: Yes other oils can be worse as they cause even more deforestation, but what I'm trying to get at is just avoiding oils in general for when they aren't needed. This is up to the big companies and manufacturers but it's just about caring for this planet.
