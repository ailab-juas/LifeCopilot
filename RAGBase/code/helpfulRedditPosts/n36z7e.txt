title:
YSK if someone goes into cardiac arrest you should begin CPR immediately after calling 911

content:
My girlfriend and I were driving yesterday when she saw a man collapse in his front yard.  She told me and I pulled over.  I found him face down by his lawnmower, unconscious.  
  
We tried to call 911 but didn’t have service, so I flagged down a neighbor and had her call.  The neighbor had a friend present and that friend tried to take his pulse, initially saying that he “was no longer with us” but then she saw him breathe slightly.

Fortunately an ambulance was there in maybe 5-6 min after the man’s collapse, and I didn’t want to approach him personally because I didn’t feel qualified.  

Why YSK:  When I went home I did some research, and if I had begun mouthless CPR– chest compressions to the beat of “Stayin’ Alive”- I might have been able to dramatically improve the man’s odds of survival.  But I didn’t know, and hadn’t had a refresher on CPR since I was a kid.

I didn’t have those tools or knowledge on-hand, and I wish I had.

I also looked up survival rates and sad to say the odds seem to be that we witnessed this man in his final minutes, or at the very least at a point where his life changed dramatically.  I wish I could have done more in the moment, and I hope by posting this someone is able to think and act more quickly if they happen to be in that situation.
