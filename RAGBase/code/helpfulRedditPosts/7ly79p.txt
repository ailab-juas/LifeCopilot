title:
LPT: when buying bagged frozen foods, avoid bags whose contents are frozen into a solid block, and choose bags whose contents remain loose.

content:
Most bagged frozen foods have contents that are individually frozen before bagging (e.g. corn, peas, berries, etc.). If the bag is frozen into a solid block, it is likely the bag has thawed and then been refrozen.
