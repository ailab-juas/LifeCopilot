LPT: Floss. Even doing it once a week will absolutely change your experience at the dentist.

content:
I know you hear it all the time from your Dentist and probably the little voice in your head, but it really does make a world of difference.  You probably hate going to the dentist because they're scrapping and prodding your teeth.  They're removing the stuff that you'd be getting yourself with flossing.

Anecdotally:  I didn't floss but maybe twice a year for 40 years.  Even straight up told my dentist I wasn't going to do it.  Then COVID hit and I assumed I wouldn't be seeing my dentist for an extended period of time, so I should take extra effort.  I started flossing once a week, maybe twice.  My next appointment went much faster and was far less painful.  Now because of changes to my morning routine\* I'm flossing 3 times a week and all they had to do was polish my teeth and they ranted and raved over the health of my gums.  I kinda felt like a schmuck for something that I know I should have been doing all along.

\*I have a Sonicare at home, but 3 days a week I get ready in the office.  Since I don't have my fancy toothbrush, I'm compensating with those little floss harp picks.  In just 2 years, I've completely changed my dental visits.

EDIT:  Oh!  I'm not a Dentist and have zero interest or specialty in the field.  I'm not trying to sneak a sales pitch at you.  This change made my life better, and I wanted to share.  


EDIT2:  OH! OH!  I only brush once a day and have only brushed once a day for probably 30 years.  I say this to add perspective, not as a recommendation.

Thank yâ€™all for the likes and the Gold. I love that something as obvious as this was so well received.
