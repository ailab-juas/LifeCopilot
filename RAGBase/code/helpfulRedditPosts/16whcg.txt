LPT: If you suck at cooking, get a crock pot. Here is every crock pot recipe: Combine all ingredients in Crock Pot, cook on low 6-8 hours, serve. You'll also save a ton of money.

It's probably one of the best investments I've made. I make of batch of whatever on Sunday and then I have lunch for the whole week.

EDIT: Since some are asking, here is the crock pot I use: http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Stay-6-Quart-Cooker/dp/B005M8IP0W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358696599&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=crock+pot+hamilton+beach

Also, I frequently use this cookbook: http://www.amazon.com/Fix-It-And-Forget-It-Big-Cookbook/dp/156148640X/ref=pd_sim_k_8

And finally, my favorite crock recipe: Slow cooked sweet pork barbacoa. http://www.skinnytaste.com/2011/01/slow-cooked-sweet-barbacoa-pork.html
