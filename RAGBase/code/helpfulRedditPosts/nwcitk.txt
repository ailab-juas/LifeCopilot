LPT: If you’re road tripping as an adventure not just to get somewhere: Buy a road atlas and take the two lane highways, It’s slow going but that’s how you actually see the countryside. There’s nothing to see on the interstates.

Buy a highlighter, take notes and mark up your map. Look for the scenic routes, they’re marked with little dots on the map. Look up the classic two lane highways. Lots of history and great small towns to explore.
