title:
LPT: Shift + Del removes autfill entries from the chrome address bar.

content:
If you regularly use the omnibar in chrome you can find that some things autofill that you don't want. 

For example:
If i type 'weather' in the address bar it will autocomplete to 'weather.com'.

This is not my desired behavior since i prefer to use the google weather display. So when it autocompletes to 'weather.com' i simply do shift + del and it will not longer autocomplete to weather.com
