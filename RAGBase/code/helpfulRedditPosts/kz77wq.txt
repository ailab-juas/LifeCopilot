LPT: With tax season upon us it's important to remember if you are doing a 1040 EZ DO NOT go to H&amp;R Block, Jackson Hewitt, or any other predatory "tax experts". It will cost you hundreds out of your refund for them to basically just copy your W2. The IRS has free online filing options at irs.gov.

The refund advance loans are a scam to get you in their doors so they can rob you of your refund. File free, be patient, and you will be much happier with your refund.
