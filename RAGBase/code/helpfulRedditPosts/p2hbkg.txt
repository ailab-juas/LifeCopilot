LPT: Just because someone surprises you with a shot doesn't mean you have to drink it

content:
We've all been there.  Partying in a group.  Suddenly a round of shots appear.  Someone across the table got it as a surprise, or celebration.  And now there's a shot in front of you, everyone's lining them up, and you don't want it.

So don't do it.

You're not a party pooper, you're not ungrateful, you're not wasting anyone's money, you're not disrespecting the toast/cause.  You're responsible for yourself, you're allowed to enjoy the night on your terms.  If some person makes a big deal out of it, YOU'RE not ruining the night, THEY are.

Shots can be fun, surprise shots can be fun.  But only if you want it.  If you are counting drinks and managing your own limits, or know your own sensitivity to mixing/particular spirits, or don't want to do a shot of something you don't recognize, don't let anyone or anything pressure you into it.

Anyone trying to "make" you more fun isn't your friend the way they think they are.

Edit: For people saying "I just dump it over my shoulder!" or "I just spill it in the sink!" or whatever, you're the kinds of people nobody wants to be friends with.  Just cause you don't want it doesn't mean it's okay to waste people's money.  Have some courage, say no, and let someone else have it.
