LPT: Toxic positivity is totally a thing. Don't let the "good vibes only" people invalidate your feelings and life experiences.

content:
Don't feel like you can't even mention the negative aspects of your life for fear of upsetting someone.
You lost your job, your grandma died, you're depressed and your job search is impacting your social life? 

It's perfectly normal and you should be able to discuss those "negative" parts of your life with the people close to you.

Don't ever let someone invalidate your feelings and experiences, just because they don't fit in in their fairytale idea of "positivity".

Talking about your grief can help you find support and empathy to overcome it.
Talking about being unemployed and your job search can help you find a job!
Talking about your problems is the way to find solutions and support.

We all need a little help from our friends at times.
Shutting down and isolating yourself can be the easiest way sometimes, but people who care about you would want to listen and help.
