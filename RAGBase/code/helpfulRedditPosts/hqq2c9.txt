YSK that most of the times booking a hotel directly from their website is better than using Booking.com, etc. The price is usually the same or even cheaper, and you could be given a better room and service. This is because the hotel is saving a 25% commission.

I know this because my brother works for a hotel. He just told me there are rooms that despite costing the same, are much better than others. He'd give those rooms for the people booking directly with them. And most of the times they even give them a bottle of champagne for free.

This is because they are saving a huge commission. And also because they had seen that clients that reserve with them directly are more willing to repeat with them.

He works for a big hotel chain. It could be difference in other hotel chains though.

TL;DR once you had chosen a hotel you like, go check their website or call them directly. You could be saving some money while getting some perks.
