LPT: Using an umbrella in the rain? Wearing a backpack?

content:
Just tuck the handle of the umbrella between your back and the backpack.  Better coverage for you and the bag, plus you get two free hands!  Impress your friends!  Amaze people driving by!

Edit; I live in a non-windy suburb out of Boston where I'm usually the only person out when it rains.  It worked perfect, fit well, and I've never gotten so many thumbs-ups from strangers in traffic.  It was a good day, haters gonna H43T! 

Edit2; oh man this is literally by far the most up votes I've ever gotten!  I need to be a ridiculous dope more often!
