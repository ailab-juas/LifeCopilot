LPT: When someone asks to borrow your phone to make a call...

content:
To avoid getting scammed or any sort of nefarious activity on your phone, and also still helping those that genuinely needs it:

* never allow them to have control over your phone
* ask them who they're calling
* ask them the number and *dial it yourself*
* put the phone on speaker during their conversation. If it's urgent (and IMO only urgent situations calls for using a stranger's phone), they shouldn't mind. If they mind, then they probably shouldn't be borrowing your phone
