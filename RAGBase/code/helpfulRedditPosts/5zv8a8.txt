title:
LPT: Tonight if offered a choice between locally-made Guinness and imported-from-Ireland Guinness, drink the locally made stuff.

Guinness doesn't travel well and the taste changes significantly while in transit from Ireland.

The locally-made version will actually taste more authentic because it is made to the same recipe, but has not had to endure weeks on the high seas.
