YSK about some online legit graduate programs from accredited universities

content:
Why YSK: Graduate education is fucking expensive, and a big commitment in more ways than one, so this is a great alternative. It helps that masters degrees obtained online have gained a lot more respect since last year.

Here's a few that have caught my eye:

[GATech MS CS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home) (#38 worldwide in computer science, QS) - $8,000 in total

Georgia Tech offers degrees in analytics and cybersecurity too at under $10,000.

[UT Austin MS CS](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program/msonline) (#28 worldwide in computer science, QS) - $10,000 in total

UTA offers a MS Data Science degree for the same price too.

[Arizona State MS Supply Chain Management](https://www.edx.org/masters/online-master-in-supply-chain-management-asux) - $18,000

(Plugging r/GradAdmissions_INTL for admissions outside thr US/Canada)

[Imperial College London MPH](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/global-mph-imperial/) - £13,000 across two years (only for students in the UK though)

[KU Leuven, Belgium MS Statistics](https://www.onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_50550147.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving) (#24 worldwide in statistics, QS) - €1,250 each year

[Higher School Of Economics, Russia MS Business Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/ms-business-analytics-hse) - $18,000

[SRH Berlin MA Photography](https://www.srh-berlin.de/en/master/photography-berlin/) - €800/month for 1.5 years

To my knowledge, all of these should result in a degree that's the same as the one you'd get, if you studied on campus.

These are just ones that've caught my eye, and I'm sure there's many others I'm missing (you could link them in the comments!)
