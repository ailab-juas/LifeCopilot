LPT: If you ever feel like making a decision when in high emotion, wait 24 hours before committing to the action

content:
My mom taught me this rule when I young, and I have lived by it ever since.  Everyone has been in a situation where their emotions are high, and immediately create an idea of action in order to solve the issue.  For example, your boyfriend pisses you off, and you decide that the best idea is to call him to bag him out.  Or you're excited about a new car test drive, or seeing a new gadget (take my money) amazon purchase etc., and you immediately decide to purchase it.  

It's amazing to see how your brain can process your choice of action over the 24 hours.  When the emotions settle, you think more cognitively and can decide responsibly without the influence of your strong emotions from the initial creation of your idea.  

I've personally noticed I've saved money, dignity, and relationships from just waiting 24 hours before committing to a high emotion decision.  It's something I wanted to share, and hopefully this advice can help someone who is in a similar situation.
