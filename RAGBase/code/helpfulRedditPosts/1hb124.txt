LPT: If you're sick to your stomach and know you're going to have to throw up to feel better, have a bit of vanilla ice cream first. It won't stop it, but it'll prevent most of the bad taste and burning that comes with sicking up.

I know it sounds a bit weird, but I discovered it by accident when I was having a lot of stomach problems. The creamyness covers up the burning, and as gross as it sounds ice cream tastes almost as good on the return trip.

When I told a coworker during her pregnancy, she tried it and wound up keeping ice cream in the house throughout her entire pregnancy it worked so well.
