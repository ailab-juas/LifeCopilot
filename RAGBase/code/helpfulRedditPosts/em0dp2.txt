YSK if you accidentally write on a white board with permanent marker, you can easily get it off using a dry erase marker

EDIT; Thank you, kind strangers, for my first ever gold and silver! I don’t even know what to do with them, but I’ve seen other Redditors gets them!

I am an elementary teacher, and I have a large white board that is also a smartboard in my classroom. At least once a year, someone accidentally writes on it with magic marker or sharpie instead of dry erase.  If this happens, all you need to do is cover the markings from the permanent marker using a dry erase marker. Then simply wipe off using a dry washcloth or eraser. I don’t know why (I’m sure someone here knows the scientific explanation!), but the dry erase marker ink breaks up the permanent marker ink, and both marks will be erased together! There is not even a shadow left behind.

This is very convenient to know when you teach 8 yr olds!
