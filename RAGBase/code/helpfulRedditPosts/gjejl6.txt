title:
YSK that if you were cornered in a bathroom, or had to defend yourself from an intruder while you are in the bathroom. The heavy ceramic top that covers the toilet tank is an effective improvised weapon

content:
Throwing shampoo bottles or even using the shower rod isn't a viable choice (especially in a cramped space). If you had to defend yourself, the ceramic top is heaviest and the most lethal improvised weapon you can reach for. It is practically a cinderblock ,and it might save your life or the life of your friend/family so you should know this.
