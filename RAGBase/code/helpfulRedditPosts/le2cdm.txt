LPT: If you have that one friend who you confide in about your hardships please make sure you also let them know about the good parts of your life. It sucks when someone only looks to you when they are having a bad day and can make the other person feel used.

I have this one friend that only ever talks to me about how bad his life is. Everything I know about him are only his problems. It makes me feel used and I feel very exhausted being around him. Please dont do that to your friends.
