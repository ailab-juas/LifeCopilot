LPT: Accidentally close out a tab you were using? Don't fret. You can press Ctrl+Shift+T to bring it right back!

content:
Furthermore, if you close out a whole window, just reopen the browser you were using and press Ctrl+Shift+T. The whole window will be restored.




EDIT: As u/SmileFirstThenSpeak reminded me, if you keep pressing Ctrl+Shift+T, it'll keep going back and opening older tabs, so if you need a tab you closed like 5 tabs ago, you can press it five times.
