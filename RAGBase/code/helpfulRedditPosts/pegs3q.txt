LPT: Learn to accept that others don't care about some things as much as you do

content:
I see a LOT of judgement in various subs:

* How can you not recycle? It's easy! Planet murderer!
* What do you mean you don't exercise regularly? It only takes like 30 minutes a day? Why are you so lazy?
* How can you eat meat? A vegan diet is an easy adjustment, you monster.

And so on.

The thing is, it doesn't matter how objectively awesome and beneficial a thing is, everyone has limited pools of time, money, interest, and willpower. It's great that you bike to work, champ! But try to remember it's not just "10 minutes on a bike" it's

* Getting a good bike and a place to store it
* Having good gear
* Learning the rules and regulations involved in using it in your area
* Having the energy to get up early enough for the extra time to prepare for a bike trip
* Having a shower or place to change at work (and having to actually change at work)
* Having a place to keep your bike
* Having to take the bike home no matter how late in the day, how the weather has changed in that time, or how exhausted and awful work was that day.

Basically, people vastly oversimplify what THEY like or do because the downsides either don't matter to them or they forgot they existed due to their lifestyle. As another example, I saw a former marine judging people for being "lazy" because they didn't regularly exercise. Meanwhile, I know people who are struggling to have enough energy to cook dinner instead of microwave foods at the end of the day due to kids, physical issues, emotional issues (depression for example). And what if someone just hates exercise while you personally don't mind that much (or love it) ? Doing a thing is much easier when you naturally enjoy it (or had some kind of life event that let you overcome your dislike or motivated you more than average to overcome it).

The point is that something that you can easily slot into YOUR lifestyle may not work so easily for someone else. Don't judge someone who's struggling with crippling debt and money management for not being charitable like you. Don't look down on someone who has computer trouble just because you like computers and it's easy for you to learn the ins and outs of computer security. Don't judge people when you don't know their limits and capabilities.

EDIT: This guy's comment really helps put it in perspective: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/pegs3q/lpt\_learn\_to\_accept\_that\_others\_dont\_care\_about/haxh0nr/?utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/pegs3q/lpt_learn_to_accept_that_others_dont_care_about/haxh0nr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Bottom line, there are a million "causes" and banners people gather around, and judging people because they're not under your banner is missing the point that you're not under theirs either. And even if someone is under no banners, there might be a very valid reason for that too. Try not to judge people you don't know or understand.

EDIT2: people getting super bent about the idea that someone might not care about recycling.
