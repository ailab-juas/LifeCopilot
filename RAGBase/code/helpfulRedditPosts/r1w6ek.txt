LPT: if a new person in your life showers you with praise and attention that’s a good predictor things will go poorly later

content:
I’m a psychologist and pretty much every person I’ve worked with who describes this scenario at the start of a relationship, whether romantic or friendship, ends up in a bad situation about 3-6 months into it. The up front over-the-top praise, gifts, attention etc may be an intentional attempt to hook you, or not malicious but signs of some psychological concerns that will emerge later. On the flip side, if you come on too strongly to a new friend it will likely go badly because they don’t reciprocate to the level you give. At first they’ll love it. But the imbalance causes resentment in you and feelings of guilt in them. They “turn” on you as a means to protect themselves from that guilt so you become the asshole, crazy person, etc. and the relationship ends in either ghosting or a major fight. Leaving you hurt and confused about how they did that after everything you did for them. If this is a pattern in your relationships, consider if you often meet people who are over the top with giving and kindness way too early or if you tend to feel the urge to win someone over through this type of stuff. I’m not talking usual kindness but a series of extremes like I just met you last Tuesday but I’ll totally drive you 15 hours to help you move. Or you’re the [insert compliment] person I’ve ever met, we’re already BFFs during your first conversation.

Edit: a lot of replies are assuming a dichotomy in behavior. No. That’s not what I’m saying nor how people behave. I’m not condoning being an asshole and never doing something nice. All or nothing thinking isn’t helpful in life, either.
