LPT. Never assume someone’s financial situation. Clothes and presentation can be deceiving.

content:
I told my professor I would not be attending class as I couldn’t afford gas. I excitedly emailed him a few days later to say that I was awarded financial assistance. Because of this, I was able to attend. 

He asked to speak to me after class today. To my surprise, he accused me of lying to him and abusing government assistance. He said that my clothes were far too nice for someone in need of financial help.

I grew up wealthy, but fell on extremely hard times. I may have nice clothes from my past life, but that is no indication of my current situation. 
 
I struggle to get by, and it was embarrassing enough for me to admit to him I couldn’t afford gas. Never assume someone’s financial situation from their outward appearance.
