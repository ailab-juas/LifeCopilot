LPT - As and adult if new friends invite you to something, say, "Yes."

content:
When you're in school the "talent pool" for new friends is huge. Also, kids are doing fun things all the time. There will be another party, another gaming session, another thing to do next week.  When you're an adult there are maybe one or two people at the office you'd want to be friends with outside of work.   


There will be a time that they invite you to a hockey game, concert, hike, or whatever and you're feeling like, "Meh, I like that thing but right now I feel like watching youtube."  


Watching youtube is a mistake.  Say, "Yes" to the opportunity. By saying, "No" you are sending the message that you don't want to be invited next time.  They might invite you one more time or they might write you off immediately.  As an adult, these opportunities are more rare and if you want friends, you have to make the most of the chances to form a friendship when they happen.
