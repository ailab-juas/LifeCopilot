LPT: Never put your pet's name on their tags.

content:
As a former Dog Trainer, I always imparted the knowledge to my students that putting your pet's name on their tags makes it much easier for them to be "stolen" if found; the finder will know their name and can use it as a form of bonding with your pet. 

Instead, it should say "Microchipped" and include your contact details. This will hopefully cause the finder to contact a vet to have a chip scan, but more importantly will prevent them from having an automatic "in" with your precious fur friend.
