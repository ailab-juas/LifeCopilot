YSK: Even when your family/partner knows you love them, you should tell them in every chance you get

content:
There is no greater satisfaction from hearing someone tell you they love you. I tell my husband that I love him whenever I can and I often ask how come he doesn't tell me he loves me, and his response is always "but you know I love you, so I don't need to tell you", it brakes my heart and by the looks of it this is not going to change even tho I told him plenty of times that I would love to hear it. He grew up in a family where they don't show affection and grow up in a family where affection and saying I love you is very important. So yeah, if you love someone tell them because that could make their day.
