title:
YSK not to download an app called look

content:
Once you download it, it sends a mass text message to *all* of your contacts with a message similar to
“Hey, [Your contact name]! u/loganthebrewer invited you to join look!” And a link. 
I got the message and downloaded to see who ‘invited me’ and now all of my contacts are receiving spam texts. 
Sorry about formatting - I’m on mobile.
