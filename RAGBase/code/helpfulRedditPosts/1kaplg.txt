YSK about Lynda.com, an online training website that has thousands of in-depth courses and is FREE with most university emails

content:
It's seriously one of the best things I've stumbled across. I watched a 4 hour course on basic programming and went from zero knowledge of the subject to knowing all of the basics fluently. 

Best of all, nearly every university (at least in the US) has a registered account with the website, which means you can log in with your .edu email and password and get access to everything for free. (Credit to u/bounce580: it's between $200-400 a year otherwise, depending on subscription).

Check it out, Reddit! www.lynda.com 

**Edit:** Some of you are reporting that logging in with your school email/password isn't working. If not, Google your school's name alongside "Lynda" and you should find your school's portal to get onto Lynda.
