LPT: If you're using an electronic admissions ticket for a flight/concert/etc, take a screenshot of the ticket in advance so you easily pull it up even if there's bad signal/wifi.

A few years back I nearly missed a flight because the tiny airport I was flying out of had poor cell service and no wifi, ever since I always screenshot my boarding pass so  I don't have to worry about loading it up, it's already saved to my phone.
