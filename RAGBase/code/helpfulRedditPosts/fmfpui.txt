title:
YSK your car should be occasionally turned on and run even if you are sheltering in place.

content:
I am not a mechanic (and someone who is can explain this better) but even if you are not planning to use it you should occasionally start it up and drive around the block/let it idle for 15-20 min every week or so.

Edit: an added bonus is for those of us who street park in a city youâ€™ll be up to date in the event of a temporary no parking zone (for tree/sewage work for example)
