LPT: If you’re traveling for vacation, take off work one or two days after you’re supposed to get back

content:
Not only does this allow you to account for missing your flight, it allows you to rest after traveling and get prepared to begin work again. While vacations are relaxing, they’re typically a lot of planning and running around. You’re going to want a day or two in a comfortable place you know after traveling to recharge for getting back into your daily schedule.
