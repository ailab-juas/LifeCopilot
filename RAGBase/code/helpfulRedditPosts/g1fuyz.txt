title:
YSK that in most cars, there’s a little sideways triangle next to the dashboard gas blinker. This will point to the side that the gas tank door is on.

I can’t believe I didn’t know this until recently. Maybe it’s common knowledge, but no one ever told me. 

I hope the title makes sense. Obviously if you only drive your car this is unhelpful advice, but for all the times you’ll drive rentals and other people’s vehicles, this triangle next to the gas light is super helpful at preventing awkward gas station maneuvering.

Edit: Oh for the love of God, most arrows I know as arrows have a stem attached to the flat side of the triangle, okay? Without the stem they’re sometimes hard to identify as arrows, so I didn’t want people to be confused about what they were looking for.

Edit 2: Sideways like this ▶️
