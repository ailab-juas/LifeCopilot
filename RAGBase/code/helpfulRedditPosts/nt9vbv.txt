YSK that if you have a friend that is very sick with cancer, sone great gifts are warm socks, skin care products and your favorite copy of a physical copy of a photo with you and them with a written message on the back

content:
Why YSK: People with cancer going through treatment have circulation problems meaning that they have cold feet hence the socks. Also the treatment they are receiving dries out the skin and decent skin care products can give a lot of relief. And most important the photo that you give with a personal message will be a treasured item that will give hope
