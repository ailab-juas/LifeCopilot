LPT: Sending a resume by email? Name it "YourName.pdf" instead of "resume.pdf", so the person downloading and reading resumes can tell which is yours.

content:
For someone downloading and reading resumes, it can get a little frustrating to have a bunch of files all named "resume.pdf" or "resume.docx".  So make the file name your full name, or something like "YourNameResume.pdf" or "YourName-Position.pdf" so whoever is reading them doesn't have to rename yours.  It's a nice touch, and shows you're thinking of the needs of the company you're applying to.

Also, use the body of the email for your cover letter, (so it's more likely to be read) then have the resume as an attachment.  If you want to send a properly-formatted cover letter along with your resume, make it a two-page document with the cover letter as the first page and the resume as the second page.  And if you have a choice, pdf is better than doc or docx, because you can be absolutely sure it looks like you want it to.

edit: For anyone having trouble saving a document as a PDF, [CutePDF](http://www.cutepdf.com/) is a nice piece of free software that will work with any Windows software that has a "Print" function.  It shows up like a printer, so all you have to do is print the document out, (even if you're not connected to a printer) and it will automatically save it as a PDF on your computer.
