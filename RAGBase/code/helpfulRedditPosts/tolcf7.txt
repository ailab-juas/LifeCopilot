LPT: If your stomach/gut hurts from gas, you can oftentimes help it pass by laying on your left. It helps the gas move from your small intestine to your large intestine. Where they connect is a common place for painful buildup.

content:
Your small intestine connects to your large intestine below your right hip, so laying on your left will help the gas rise within your body and make the transition. Hot air rises even inside the body.

After ten-twenty minutes, roll over on your right to help the gas move through your large intestine. It wraps from below your right hip to the top of your gut and all the way to below your left hip, so this will help the gas make the rest of the journey to the world outside your body. 

You might have to repeat this roll-over a few times for it to help fully, and my best suggested interval for subsequent roll-overs is to spend 5-10 minutes on each side until you have vented sufficiently.

Regardless of if you have access to Gas-X or similar meds, this is a really useful tip. It helps even more with the meds because (to the best of my understanding) they break up the bubbles into smaller bubbles, and they can pass much more easily. 

As a recently elevated fart factory (pregnancy is fun), I already knew this, but now, it basically saves me on the daily. I never knew how much gas a person can produce without other health conditions. A lot. It’s A LOT.

/Greetings from the couch where I’m waiting for the meds to kick in so I can go back to bed.
