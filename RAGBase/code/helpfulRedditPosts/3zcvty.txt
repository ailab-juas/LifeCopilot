LPT: When putting someone who is really drunk to bed, put a backpack full of clothes on them to make sure they don't roll over.

content:
If you strap them into the backpack and put them in the rescue position, they won't be able to roll over. All you need is a backpack and a bunch of clothes, which are easily available items. Did this all through college and another benefit was having all my friends know they had fucked up when they woke up with a backpack strapped to them.

I call this practice "turtling."
