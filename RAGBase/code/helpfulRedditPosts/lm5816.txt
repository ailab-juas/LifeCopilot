YSK: Just Because You Forgive Someone Doesn't Mean You Have To Let Them Back Into Your Life

content:
Why YSK:  Too often, people expect that everything will return to the way it was "before" when they do something horrible to you or treat you badly. Some people expect that as their preordained right and some even bother to apologize. **To be let "back into" your life is not a given.**  Just because you are able to get past other people's crappy and hurtful behavior doesn't mean that they automatically regain the privilege of being included in your life. Give yourself the freedom to forgive/move past their behaviour but allow yourself the power to remove toxic people (yes, even "family") from your life. You will live a better life not being hurt repeatedly by the same people.
