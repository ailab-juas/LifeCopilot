LPT: Hang pictures on your wall at 57” on center, which is the standard gallery viewing height.

content:
You’ve probably been hanging them too high, and it will feel weird at first!

57” (145cm) puts pictures right at an optimal position, and is the accepted “standard gallery” viewing height.  When you use this as a standard, your living space will look much cozier.  There is always an exception of course but this is a good rule of thumb.

Do a little math to figure out where to poke your hole on the wall:

1.	Measure your picture’s height and halve it. 

2.	Figure out how far the distance from the top edge of the picture is to what the picture will actually hang on.  Sometimes that’s a piece of wire - take your finger and pull the wire up like it’s hanging on a wall, and measure from your finger to the top of the frame.  Or, if it’s a hanging clip, measure the distance from the top of the clip to the top of the frame.  Subtract this from the first value.

3.	Add 57 if working in inches, (or 145 if working in centimeters)

Example:  
I have a picture that’s 24” tall.  Half of that is 12”.  The hanging wire when fully taught leaves 3.25” from the top of the picture.

So, 12 - 3.25 + 57 = 65.75”

Measure up from the floor 65.75” and make your hole!

Edit:  I was informed about the error in my original math, and have corrected it

Edit: I never imagined how sensitive people would be over this tip, it’s not a law, it just looks nice when you do it lol
