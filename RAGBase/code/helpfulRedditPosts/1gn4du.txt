LPT: Do not ask if there is anything on the resume that concerns the interviewer. Instead, ask about opportunities you'll be presented with in five years if you joined the company tomorrow.

The one about "Is there anything on my application that concerns you" is a horrible idea.

Here are some real questions you should ask:

"Assuming everything for today were to work out, what sort of opportunities will I be presented with in five years?"

"I've done XXXX research about your company; however, I was unable to find any information about YYYY, can you tell me anything about this?" (exampe: Previous CEO, Current CEO)

"If I were to join your team, what would you recommend for me to do to ensure my transition be as smooth as possible?" 

"Do you have an email or phone number I can note so we can keep in touch?"

"What are the positives and negatives about working here?"  (You probably won't get negatives. I only got them once)

Edit:  It's interesting how the opinions of reddit strongly disagree with each other. My questions above are more geared towards large companies, or any where you want a career. I think the better advice here is what I saw someone else write, there is no such thing as a blanket interview set of questions.... And I don't think anyone should use these verbatim. You should be able to spin your own style off of all interview advice, and secure your own job.
