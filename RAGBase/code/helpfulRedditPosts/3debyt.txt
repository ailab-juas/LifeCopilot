LPT: Always keep communications with your landlord in writing (email)

content:
My previous landlord 'never received' the mandatory 60 day move-out for that I put in their mailbox and were going to charge me two months rent! Luckily I sent an email letting them know that I placed the form in their mailbox so I wasn't charged a penny extra.

Some landlords will be happy to nickel and dime you for anything that can allow them to give you less of your security deposit back.
