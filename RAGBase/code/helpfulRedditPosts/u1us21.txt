YSK: As long as you have a glasses prescription, there's lots of places online where you can buy cheap glasses.

Why YSK: I recently got a pair of big golden glasses that I really love. I've had more than one person asking me about where I got them and how much they cost. I got them for $25 and almost every person I tell seems extremely confused and skeptical. The prices of glasses in those eye test stores are usually $100 and up and so many people have told me they spend anywhere from $100 - $300 for a single basic pair of glasses. 

Basically, there's places online where you can order glasses as long as you have a copy of your prescription. I usually go to ZenniOptical, where I realized I can get glasses for about $10 and proceeded to buy about 12 pairs. You don't have to pay an insane amount of money if you're willing to wait a little while for them. 

They cost more or less depending on your lenses, but I've never seen any even close to how much you have to pay by going to the store yourself.
