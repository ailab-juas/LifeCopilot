LPT: Making a fancy meal for a special occasion? Do a full practice run first! NEVER make food for a special occasion that you haven't attempted before, no matter how confident you are in your cooking.

content:
I do a fair bit of cooking for family occasions, and I frequently get asked how it always seems to go perfectly as though I'm I'm some kind of food wizard. I'm not a spectacular chef by any means, it's just that if I'm making a complicated meal for an important event, you'd better believe I've been testing it out across the previous week, identifying potential pitfalls and working out what ingredients and components I can prepare in advance.

I've known way too many people who seem to think that diving blindly into the complete unknown is somehow part of preparing a fancy meal, and it really doesn't have to be like that.

**EDIT:** It seems I have fallen victim to one of the classic blunders by assuming a basic level of common sense on the internet.

Yes, if you are spending Â£1000 on an A5 wagyu steak topped with the finest Russian caviar and gold leaf, then I'm not saying you should buy those ridiculously expensive ingredients twice just to practice; perhaps do a couple of cheaper steaks the week before if you're not used to cooking them though?

Yes, if you have been cooking complex meals every day for the last 30 years, you probably don't need to do this.
