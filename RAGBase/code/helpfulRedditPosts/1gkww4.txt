How to wake up in the mornings. Especially if you are a snoozer.

content:
You need to practice "waking up" to your alarm during the waking hours of the day.  We frequently try to will power our selves out of bed in the morning. However, our minds are obviously functioning at shit levels and making a good decision when you are groggy is near impossible.  The trick is to train your mind so that the response is automatic and not a decision.

1. Pick a song or sound to wake up to.
(Preferably not a song you like, you'll just end up hating it)

2. After you've been up for at least an hour or two, set your bedroom like you would for going to bed.. Close the shades turn the lights off, and whatever else you feel is necessary. 

3. Set your alarm to go off in 5 mins after you've laid down. 

4. When you hear your alarm go off, get up and start doing things  that you might do when actually waking up.

5. Repeat this twice a day for one month and you will never go back to hitting the snooze again.

This works especially well because it is self reinforcing.
