YSK: Feeding wildlife (I.e foxes) is NOT okay and is NOT safe.

content:
After a recent post reached r/all showing off an adorable wild fox on a person porch, it received lots of love as well as backlash for why it was there. The OP stated that it started feeding the fox, and eventually it brought others, then gave birth to cubs. The entire family of foxes enjoys the OPs kindness was loved by these animals. The bad thing about this, is that the entire family is now dependent on the OP for food. The cubs will grow up eating food that may lack the necessary nutrition as well as prevent the parents having to teach their cubs how to hunt. An adult fox that cannot hunt and associates humans with food is a danger to not only society, but also itself.  

It is known to many that feeding wildlife isn’t acceptable nor safe. Yet there are still some who believe otherwise. No matter the region you’re in, it is NOT okay.

&gt; It isn’t safe for humans because some bold animals may not take “no” for an answer and become aggressive. • Feeding encourages larger numbers of animals to gather. This can incite fighting, as well as the spread of disease, sometimes to pets and humans.

~~The only acceptable wild animals to feed are birds and squirrels. Even these animals could become aggressive but it is nowhere near as likely or common as others such as foxes.~~ not even worth trying to fight for either side. Just err on the side of caution and don’t feed wild animals if you enjoy safety of you and others
