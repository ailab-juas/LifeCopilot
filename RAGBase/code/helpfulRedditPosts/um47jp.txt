YSK: For US passports, other countries won't let you in if your passport expires within X months of the passport's expiration date

content:
Why YSK: For example, Europe requires all passports to expire at least 3 months from departure date. If your passport expires in July, and your trip is scheduled for May, they will not let you in.

The airlines see this as your responsibility to know this and will not be held accountable.
