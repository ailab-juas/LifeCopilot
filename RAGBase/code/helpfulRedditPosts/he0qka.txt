title:
YSK that tough love is not the solution for your child's depression

content:
Depressed people, especially kids and teens are fragile and saying things like that can make them feel like shit and can have a lasting effect on them. 

I was depressed. My parents didn't know how to behave since it was their first time dealing with depression. My dad started saying things like "get over it" and "man up, pull yourself together". I was depressed till then but became suicidal after that. Even since then, I haven't been able to talk to my dad normally. It's been 3 years now and our relationship is still strained. 

Here I am unable to even tell him that I love him on father's day.

Edit: I'm 21 currently and my dad is around 50. Also, I understand that saying you should know this because it happened to me is not exactly convincing and might lack credibility. There are numerous studies about depression that will help you understand how to deal with it but all i wanted to say was kindness and compassion would be helpful instead of tough love.
