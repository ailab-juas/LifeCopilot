LPT: Try to get in the habit of replacing self-deprecating thoughts with understanding thoughts.

content:
Instead of "I'm so dumb. I only have 2 brain cells to rub together." try to think: "I didn't think of it that way/I didn't know that."

Instead of "I'm so lazy" try to think "I don't have the energy for this right now." And so on.

If you attack yourself with self deprecation, you'll damage your mental health and self esteem.
