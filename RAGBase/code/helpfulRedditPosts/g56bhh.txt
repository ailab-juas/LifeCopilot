YSK The 'S' in time zones (e.g. EST) refers to Standard time, which is observed during colder months in the US. Right now, you mean 'EDT' for Eastern Daylight Time.

Same goes for other US time zones (CDT, PDT, etc).  Or you can just leave out the central letter to keep it generic ('Let's meet at 1pm ET').
