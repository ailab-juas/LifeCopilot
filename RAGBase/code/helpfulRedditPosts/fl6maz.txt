YSK You are probably eating WAY too much per meal.

content:
I used to think I just "ate big" which was the case, but not really. If you have the strength to portion out your meals (try meal prep containers) and keep up with it you will be absolutely amazed by how much you're able to eat. Portion sizes (American especially) are crazy big and we get used to eating them after a while and our stomachs stretch. You will lose weight and become much healthier in the process. I still find myself making plates much too big because I'm not used to eating correctly yet.
