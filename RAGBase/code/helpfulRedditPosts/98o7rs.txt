YSK: Buy a domain name, and set up a catch-all to forward emails to your actual email address

content:
I feel like this should be a LPT, but those guys are pricks.  Anyway:

Domains are pretty cheap these days. You might not get your own name, but you can get something fun instead perhaps.

Congratulations! You can now have a bunch of email addresses!
For example:

amazon@example.com ebay@example.com reddit@example.com email@example.com shadystuff@example.com work@example.com

The bonus to this, is that you can set your proper email to filter incoming mail based on the address it was sent to.
