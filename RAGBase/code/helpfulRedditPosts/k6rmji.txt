LPT: Keep a couple of those cheap $2-$3 frozen pizzas around and throw your leftovers on them.

Instead if throwing leftovers out. Put it on those cheap frozen pizzas.
Left over chicken. Some onions. Extra cheese. Different BBQ sauces. Etc etc.
They cook 10-15 minutes too. Easy and cheap meals.

Edit: fun little story since this post is getting a nice bit of attention (thanks for the awards btw).

I had a friend back in the day that on Fridays would get a cheese pizza from the local pizza joint. Then goto KFC and order a bucket of chicken and a small gravy. He would then proceed to take the skin off the chicken - place the skin on the pizza and drizzle with gravy.
"Chicken skin pizza" he called it...

Yes he was very fat. No I never tried it (but I secretly want to). We were in the army and he waddled his way through morning runs lol.
