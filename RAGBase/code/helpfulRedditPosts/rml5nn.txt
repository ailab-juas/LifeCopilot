LPT: Don't eat lunch in the break room, if you can, leave the building and enjoy your lunch

content:
I learnt this the hard way, the biggest reason is, if you sit in the break room, someone will ask for help and you will miss out on lunch. 

I used to sit in the break room, ready to take my first bite of food and someone would always need my help. If you don't help, you seem like a bitch and if you do help, you don't get extra time to eat. 

So leave the building, go for a walk or even just sit in your car and enjoy the peace

Edit: I don't work in an office like most people are saying. I've worked at many places and this has always happened. 

People who are saying 'just say no', that doesn't always work.
