LPT: If you feel unsafe while someone else is driving, pretend you are going to be sick.

content:
If someone is speeding or just generally driving dangerously but you are too afraid to speak up or worried they won't listen to your concerns, pretending that you are going to vomit is a sure fire way to get them to pull over and stop, or at the very least slow down. 

My mum told me this one when I was in highschool - where peer pressure and anxiety could definitely stop you from speaking up about someone driving recklessly.

EDIT: Obviously if you can it's best to just tell someone you feel unsafe, but this is a good as a last resort or if you think it'll lead to a safer outcome.
