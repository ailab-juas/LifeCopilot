title:
YSK that most cats are lactose intolerant and shouldn't be given milk or cream. There are also lots of houseplants that are toxic to cats, so please do the proper research prior to getting either.

content:
There are lots of pop culture references with cats loving a glass of milk, but in fact it can be dangerous in even average quantities. Not enough folks out there are aware that many house plants can also be dangerous, and if your cat tries to eat parts of your plant (which mine definitely does) your cat may get very ill.
