LPT - When asking someone if they want to go out, rather than ask 'Are you free this friday?', ask them immediately what you want, like 'Want to grab a drink this friday?'

content:
When asking if they are free, people tend to feel cornered/ambushed \(whatever the correct word is\), they don't know WHAT you're about to ask, it could be to hang out \(which is fun\), but you could also be asking them to help you move or help you with your homework or whatever \(which is not fun\), so to play safe, they will most likely reply with some kind of excuse to not go. 

Also, especially in the dating game, it works wonders if you form your question into a statement, so instead of asking 'Hey, do you want to go to the movies with me?', say 'Hey, im going to watch Deadpool 2 this friday and it would be nice if you came with me', that way you're showing that you were going to have fun anyway, but you would find it even more fun if she came with you, BUT it also makes it easier for her to decline and not feel pressured into it, cause no matter what her answer is, she knows you would still be going anyway.
