LPT: If you order electronics in winter and they are delivered outside. Do not charge them immediately. Let it stay in room temperature before charging it. Charging Li-Io batteries when they are cold would damage them and reduce their life cycle.

content:
 Doing so even once will result in a sudden, severe, and permanent capacity loss on the order of several dozen percent or more, as well a similar and also permanent increase in internal resistance. This damage occurs after just one isolated 'cold charging' event, and is proportional to the speed at which the cell is charged. 

 But, even more importantly, a lithium ion cell that has been cold charged is ***NOT*** safe and must be safely recycled or otherwise discarded. By not safe, I mean it will work fine until it randomly explodes due to mechanical vibration, mechanical shock, or just reaching a high enough state of charge.
