LPT: Use baby powder to easily remove sand after a day at the beach.

content:
Living near the beach I thought this was common knowledge, but seems that lots of people don't know how well baby powder will get sand off your body. 

Just sprinkle it wherever needed and rub around - the powder absorbs the excess moisture and releases the sand.  Rinsing sand off with water leaves you wet and attracts more sand.   Seriously, the powder works really well and leaves little residue if you do it right. 

Works great for young kids - way better than trying to rinse it off while they fight you, or not rinsing and having sand tracked in to your car or house. Plus, as a parent you might have some baby powder with you anyway. 

Edit:  I've received way too many replies that baby powder causes cancer.  I had not heard of this risk before, so I did about two minutes of research and discovered that there MIGHT be a not-yet proven link between talc and increased cancer.  So, I'm not personally concerned, but feel free to do some reading, or just don't use this tip. Your call. 

You could probably also use corn starch instead of baby powder to remove sand, but I haven't tried it.  I've already devoted too much time to this simple tip, so just do whatever you like best. 

EDIT 2:  I just checked my baby powder and it's all cornstarch, no talc. So that's means 1) cornstarch does work and 2) talc free baby powder is easy to find.  So stop with the cancer messages. 

EDIT 3:  Check it out! I'm actually receiving hate mail over this.  What is wrong with people?
