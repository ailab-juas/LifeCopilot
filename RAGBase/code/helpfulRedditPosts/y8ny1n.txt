YSK: "Letting it mellow" can save you money on water bills, but can cost you more in future plumbing repairs

content:
Why YSK: Many people often urinate in the washroom, and don't flush so as to save water. When using a toilet, your waste &amp; it's residue goes through a trap, and residuals will sit there until water flushes them out. 

When not flushing often after using the toilet, this matter will slowly build up over time, creating what plumbers refer to as ["piss stalagmites" (caution, gross)](https://i.imgur.com/Qhfbyta.jpg), which can cause drainage issues with your plumbing.

Edit: for the doubters - I work as an apprentice at a plumbing company, and before I made this post, I'd shown the initial photo to a few plumbers and YES, this does happen.
