YSK that replacing the beginning of a Wikipedia article (such as en, for English) with "simple" brings up an ELI5 version of the article.

content:
[String theory, starting with en.wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory)

[String theory, starting with simple.wikipedia](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory)

This works for plenty of Wikipedia articles, but isn't a prerequisite to making one, so not every page has a simple counterpart. However, most popular topics do.
