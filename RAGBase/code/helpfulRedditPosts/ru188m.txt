title:
YSK To be aware of your surroundings.

content:
Why YSK: It's just courtesy. Walking slowly in the middle of an aisle at the grocery store, or stopping right in a doorway, or stopping in the middle of a moving crowd, or accidentally cutting someone off while turning a corner, etc. create bad foot traffic and are generally inconvenient to others.

If you're in a public place, *always* be watching for other people that you might accidentally bump into. If you must stop, make an effort to position yourself out of the way (off to the side, not obstructing shelves, etc) or get out of the way when needed.
