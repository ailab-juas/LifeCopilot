LPT: Take pics of your kids before going to public places

content:
When going to a large and/or crowded public place like an amusement park, fair, concert, etc. with kids (or perhaps with challenged adults), take a quick individual picture of each before entering. That way you have an image that can be shared with security / law enforcement if the child gets separated or lost, including the exact clothing they were wearing that day. It will greatly speed the process of organizing a search to have an accurate description and image of the missing person. Hopefully you never will need to use the pics in this way, and they can be a memory of a fun day.
