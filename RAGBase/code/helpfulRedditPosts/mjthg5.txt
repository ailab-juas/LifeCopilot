YSK that digging large holes on the beach or elsewhere can be dangerous and you must cover or fill them back in before you leave.

Why YSK: I’ve just been reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/mjljw7/why_do_holes_attract_fellow_guys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about digging holes on the beach and although it feels like I’m being Buzz Killington about what sounds like a lot of fun, reading the comments there were a few that said that people had dug either very large or very deep holes on the beach or other places and left them. This can be dangerous.

If you leave big holes on the beach, people’s children will find them and it will look like a great thing to play with. The sand is very unstable and it can take a small child or even nothing at all to collapse the sides of the hole and bury a child.

And it doesn’t have to be children:

Digging holes in other areas for construction or other projects presents the same problems, especially for wildlife. Animals can fall in and not be able to climb back out, dying from exhaustion or starvation or where there is rainfall or water, drowning. It’s important to cover over any holes being dug each day to prevent wildlife from being trapped overnight.

If you’re digging a hole on the beach it’s perfectly fine, but people should be mindful of the dangers of unsupported beach sand and how unpredictable it can be. You shouldn’t dig tunnels or ever crawl through one on the beach and you must fill them back in when you’re done.
