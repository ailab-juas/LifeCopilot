YSK In the US the signs on the backs of dump trucks that say "stay back x distance, not responsible for broken windshields" are absolutely false. They are still liable for everything that is on their truck.

Just got my windshield replaced after a quick phone call to the company with a truck number/date/and time of incident, even though one of those signs was in clear view on the back of the truck. The sign is just a scare tactic and hold no legal meaning.
