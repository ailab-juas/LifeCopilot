YSK Weblock blocks ads on your iPhone. Use it to block pop ups on Pandora, Youtube, game apps etc. No jail break. It was featured in AppsGoneFree yesterday

You should know this because an ad blocker that effects all apps across an iphone with no jail break is pretty much unheard of and it works well

Edit&gt; "the catch" is only works with Wifi  
Edit2&gt; It's no longer free, it's $1.99 now. Although, I would gladly pay more than $2 for this service
