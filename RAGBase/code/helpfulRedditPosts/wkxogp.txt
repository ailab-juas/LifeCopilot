LPT: When putting down an animal, you don't need to take them to the vet. The vet can come to your home, and do it in a place that your pet is comfortable and familiar.

content:
I've seen a few posts about putting down pets on here before, and people suggesting that you should be with them when it's happening because they will be stressed and scared at the vets office, and they shouldn't be alone with a stranger for their last moments. It is possible for a vet to come to your home and have the procedure done there. That way, they are more comfortable with their home surroundings, and don't have the extra stress and anxiety going to the vets office.

I'm not sure if this is possible everywhere in the world, but it's quite common in the UK where I live, and thought I would share this here.
