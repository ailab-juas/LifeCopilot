LPT: If youâ€™re going somewhere for Thanksgiving with the hopes of bringing home leftovers, bring your own food containers.

content:
Edit:
1. obviously this is assuming you are very close with the host and are pretty sure leftovers will be OFFERED. 
2. unless you are bringing something to share in the containers, leave them in your car until the leftovers are OFFERED. 
3. HELP WITH THE DAMN DISHES!
