LPT: If there's a shift change as a bar while you're enjoying the service, close out your tab before you leave. I've noticed that a lot of bartenders don't like to ask for that.

Edit, 2 reasons: first, I admit the post is poorly worded. I meant to close out before you would normally as you're leaving.

Secondly, this isn't meant to be some hard and fast rule, just a nice thing you could do if you notice and are so inclined.
