LPT: When you buy a bike, write down the serial number.

content:
I'm watching my friend, who had his bike stolen in Denver, struggle to get the police to believe that it was his. He built it part by part, for a year. Someone is now selling it on Craigslist. My buddy can name the components, has pictures riding it, and knows it front to back. His mechanic also backed his claim, but it doesn't matter. You have to have the numbers. Take a picture, write them down, do anything. It will save you loads of cash. Don't let it happen to you! 

Edit: 
Here are some useful links to register: 

* In the UK, use http://www.immobilise.com/
* In the US, use http://www.nationalbikeregistry.com/ 
* NYC also has stamps available at local precincts that goes on the bike itself.
