LPT: If someone has poor mental health, whether it’s depression/anxiety, bi-polar disorder or OCD, and is treating you badly, you are 100% allowed to defend yourself and call them out. If they refuse to seek help, it is not your job to convince them, walk away and save yourself the headache.

content:
I am sick and tired of the horror stories I hear of men and women trapped in crappy relationships and friendships, too afraid to speak out and defend themselves because the other person is severely depressed and “too fragile” for criticism. But then that same person will be treating the people around them like absolute shit on a daily basis, then playing the victim when confronted.

People who do this and outright refuse help, do not deserve your time and effort because they have chosen to be a martyr. All they will do is drag you down like an energy vampire and you do not need that kind of negativity in your life.
