* Headrests should be positioned 2 to 4 inches away from the back of your head.
* In the case of an accident, you want the headrest to contact your head first, and not your neck. Contacting the next first will actually increase injury to yourself.
* When adjusting for height, the majority of the headrest should sit at ear level, directly behind the drivers head.
* A properly aligned headrest can reduce injury by up to 40%. That number is HUGE.
* If you aren't sure you have the headrest lined up right, have someone else look at the headrest while you're sitting in the car seat to ensure you have the headrest at the right level.

Since it's winter time for some of us, take a minute to properly adjust your headrest. And be safe out there, fellow Redditors.
