LPT: If you're not in a rush to be somewhere, drive the backroads.

content:
Specifically targeted at those this weekend going places.

If you're spending all your time alternating from computer / relaxing then you're in a rush when you get in your car to be somewhere on time, you're just stressing yourself out a bit.

If you're not in a rush, plan a route to get to your destination using no interstates but instead local roads / state routes.

I've driven like this for almost a year now and rarely ever get on the interstate anymore, and it only takes maybe 10-20 minutes more to get somewhere that would've taken me 45 minutes anyway.

And the best part? You avoid a lot of the crazy drivers on the road. You get to enjoy the road, relax, drive at a slightly  slower speed and feel the curves and turns of the road instead of on a long (nearly) straight line to your destination.

Hell if you're in even less of a rush you may find great scenery or places to stop and check out sometime. Little back towns and restaurants you've never heard of that now you're passing by you might just feel like checking out.


Try it, just once, and see if it helps. For me? It's reduced stress by a bunch, since I'm no longer worried about being somewhere on time, but instead enjoying the drive as much as the destination.
