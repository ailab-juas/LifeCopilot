LPT: To get fit, start going to the gym without “working out.”

content:
It’s hard to get started full force, even when you’re motivated to do so. It’s a lot easier to bar yourself from doing more work and then getting excited to add to your routine. 

What worked for me (and many friends/family that have followed) is to focus first on spending a full hour ***every day*** in the gym. For the first couple weeks, only let yourself use the treadmill… start off walking, but make sure you spend the full hour in the gym ***every single day.***

It may feel silly to go to the gym and not sweat, but I promise that if you’re consistent this will work. 

After a couple days you’ll probably notice that you want to do a little more than just walk for an hour… maybe you start challenging yourself see how many miles you can fit into the hour. 

Eventually (once the hour EVERY DAY) becomes part of your normal routine, you’ll find yourself actively wanting to try other exercises to fill up your gym time, ***and it will be enjoyable.***

Start will the lowest weights you can. It will feel silly to bench press 5-10lb dumbbells at first, but again… you’ll find yourself wanting the additional challenge later. 

Then you might start challenging yourself to eat better, as to not ruin all the work you’ve been putting in at the gym. 

6-8 weeks in and your body will start to show progress, whether or not you’ve started your journey to lifting (which is the end goal). 

You can do it. Get started. Stay consistent. Your physical, and more importantly, mental health will thank you for it.

Edit: Don’t care what you say. My advice revolves around THE GYM. Going physically to THE GYM. The space is important.

Edit 2: A lot of “um ackchewally” comments followed with how they are ***attempting*** to get past their fitness struggles… 
Again, this method is tried and true. If you have aspirational fitness goals, you will figure out the rest after you have this solid habit formed (or as you’re forming it). Don’t tell me “this may work for some” while you aren’t fit at all or are struggling to get there. ***If*** you can make it to the gym for an hour a day—this method *will* work.

Final edit: For those of you who are gym rats—try and remember how hard it was for you to start (unless you are an athlete, which kind of forces the habit to start). When I was a gym rat before Covid, I remember thinking to myself wtf all these people need to just start it’s so easy to be consistent and fit. But looking back on it, I remember how many times I tried to start and failed, until I just did this. And this is what I did to get back in shape over the last several months. The hardest part is just getting started and staying consistent.
