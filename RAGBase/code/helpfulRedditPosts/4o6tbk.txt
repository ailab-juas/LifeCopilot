LPT: How To Recognize When Someone Is Drowning

content:
Saw [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/4o6342/lifeguard/d49xm15) posted in /r/interestingasfuck and thought it was worth sharing. Drowning is hard to spot and knowing this information could help you to save a life!

TL;DR:

Drowning isn't about loud splashing and noise (though you should respond to that too!). Look out for these signs:

* Head low in the water, mouth at water level
* Head tilted back with mouth open
* Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus
* Eyes closed
* Hair over forehead or eyes
* Not using legs â€“ Vertical
* Hyperventilating or gasping
* Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway
* Trying to roll over on the back
* Appear to be climbing an invisible ladder
*Difficulty or inability to wave for help
