LPT: Compliment a kid's glasses - some get bullied mercilessly for wearing them. I always add that [insert glasses colour] is my favourite colour

content:
I work in retail and if there's a kid (like, under 10 years old) at the counter and they wear glasses, I always tell them this if I can - their smiles are always the sweetest! Yes, maybe they get teased for needing them by their peers, but at least the \~ nice lady at the store \~ said she liked them, right?

EDIT to address the "this isn't an LPT" argument and the "don't be creepy" argument. First; I personally get a nice little feeling when people react positively to a genuine compliment, so I think it's a win-win. Secondly, I'm a short 21yo female, so I guess I get some "not immediately assumed to be a creep" privilege here, but I also only ever do this when people are paying and leaving and when the parent is with the kid, so.
