LPT: wanna consistently hit the gym? (Or any other habit)

content:

The hard part of going to the gym is the “going” so let’s make that easier: for the next month, you only have to go there, no working out, not even one pushup. Just go there and go straight home afterwards. It should only take a couple of minutes depending on how far from your home the gym is. Do this twice a week and by the end of the month you got yourself a habit. You might feel like you are not accomplishing much… but you are! You are building the habit! 

I did this and I haven’t stopped going to the gym since I started going half a year ago.

Make it easy, make it rewarding, make it straightforward.

[edit] Awesome! I had no idea this was gonna blow up to this extent. A lot of people in the comments have already pledged to get started with it! Best of luck to y’all and hope to see your gains in the future!!
