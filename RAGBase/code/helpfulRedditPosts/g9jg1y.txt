LPT Safety Tip: If you live in a sketchy area, let your door hinges squeak, it is a free alarm system.

content:
This works with indoor doors too, hearing doors between rooms squeaking loudly at night might just be the difference between robbery bob pulling it off and you grabbing the bat and whacking his ass over the head before he escapes with your goodies.

This doesn't prevent crims getting in, but it does give you the chance to do something to protect yourself.
