title:
YSK that you do not have to pay for a boating license

content:
[Boat US](https://www.boatus.org/) will let you take the certification and print your license for free.

Edit: As Lots of people have mentioned, this is only available in a set of US states, and some states required a physical card, which can cost $10. 

The point is, the test portion is free through this site, which I was excited to hear. Sorry if the post was clickbait-y.
