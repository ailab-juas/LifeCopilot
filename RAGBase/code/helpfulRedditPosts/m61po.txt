LPT: Always be friendly with people who help make your life better (janitors, secretaries, yard workers, etc)

content:
Do this everywhere! Work, school, home, the movies, that one black hole, EVERYWHERE. At some point you may really need their help for something and if they think of you as a friend they will be more likely to help you. Also if you do this it means you're a decent human being.
