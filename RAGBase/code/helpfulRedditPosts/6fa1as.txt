title:
LPT: Even if you're pretty sure a friend can't go to an event, invite them anyway.

content:
Your friend will greatly appreciate you thinking of them, and may also be able to clear their schedule to allow them to go. 

This also prevents said friend from feeling left out, and they can't be angry for not being invited, should someone post things on social media or them just find out in general. 

EDIT: /u/newsfan had a great point: It always feels better to turn down an invitation than to not be invited at all.  
EDIT2: /u/TomilloT has a great point: an invitation could potentionally cause serious stress and anxiety in some people. When inviting anyone, especially when you know they can't go, always make sure they know there's no pressure to go.
