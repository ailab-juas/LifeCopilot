LPT: You will never "feel like" doing something that you should do. You just have to do it.

content:
To quote Shia LaBeouf, just do it. 

Seriously though, something I've learned over time is that when you have something you need to do, there's a moment where you're like "man, I need to do that," but think: "I'll just do it later when I'm in the mood." So far as I know, that mood never comes. So the moment you think "man, I need to do that," is the moment you have to do it. It isn't easy, but it's the only way to get it done. Plus you'll feel good afterwards.

EDIT: To clairfy, because perhaps I was a bit heated in the moment I posted this, you have to discipline yourself and not wait for something to feel right to do it. Obviously there are things you flat out don't want to do like jump off a bridge (/r/suicidewatch if you do), but I'm talking about the things that you *know* you should do or maybe just really want to, but it's *easier* to do something else. That's the point I'm getting at here. *Those* are the things that you just need to forget about feelings, and just do them.
