LPT: Take the doors off fridges when moving/installing them. It makes them immensely lighter and more maneuverable.

Edit 1: since people are getting technical about things here. You can also use an appliance cart or air sled. I was just trying to give an easy tip that could be done with a screwdriver.

Edit 2: the side by side’s we’d sell were 450 lbs of long, tall, and wide machine. One of the doors would have a built-in ice maker and electronics inside it. That door was easily 50 lbs if not more by itself. Then, you still have the other side door and the bottom freezer door. Removing the doors made it close to 100 lbs lighter. No, even with a standard dolly, I can’t move 450 lbs up and down stairs without damaging property. Plus, you can keep the doors from being damaged by moving them separately. 

Edit 3: I don’t know if this voids the warranty. I just installed and repaired the appliances. However, we’d do this to almost every new fridge we’d deliver. There was never a problem with the manufacturer and I don’t even know how they’d know it was done. I mean it’s just screws for the doors and hinges and clips for the waterline and electronic line. There wasn’t any tape or any type of system to show that the doors had been tampered with. 

Edit 4: if your fridge has water and electronic lines running through the door, unclip the lines 1st before unscrewing that door. 

Edit 5: all contractors out there. Can you not install those super tiny really high hard to reach cabinets over the fridge space. No one really uses them and the fridges are only getting taller. We would either have to rip them out or have the client buy a smaller model.
