LPT: Before buying something, remember to consider the question, “How difficult will cleaning this thing be?”

**Edit:**

Wow, I *never* thought this LPT would get this kind of upvote response. Ultimately, you can thank my mom who would frequently remind me about the cleaning consideration, especially after she was dusting :-p

I was just in Puerto Rico, and I stumbled upon a shop that was selling this cedar hope chest with gorgeous, elaborate scrollwork (similar to this one [pictured online](https://d8ys5mrbqhmjx.cloudfront.net/puertorico/companies/haitian-gallery-art-and-crafts/large/haitian-gallery-art-and-crafts-150285.jpg)). I almost bought it...but, dusting this thing? Even with canned air, no way.
