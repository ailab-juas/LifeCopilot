YSK that synthetic weed (spice or K2) can cause something worse than death when you use it, especially the first time, and it can ruin your children and loved ones' lives.

This is a PSA due to higher-than-normal levels of stress and drug use at this time of the year.  Synthetic drugs cause you to live in your own tortured existence - a fate worse than death.

My ex-husband was a high-level IT Engineer/Exec. After doing synthetic weed with a new girlfriend, he went into permanent psychosis due to actual brain damage from Spice/K2/etc.  (She did too, but I don't know whatever happened to her).

Over the course of a year  he'd attacked the police, stolen his children and told them bad people were trying to hurt them, ruined the computer hardware and networks of an employer (he thought FBI was after him), tried to kidnap his oldest daughter from her mom, and woke up with a head wound 4 states away with no idea how he got there but tried to blame it on me and the government.  

He destroyed our kids' lives financially and emotionally - between therapy costs to deal with the trauma, complete lack of child support from him, lack of health benefits, and one day he just left the country and is now overseas in a mental hospital...  I work but live in a high-cost area. I make too much to qualify for any benefits of any kind. The state can't help because he's overseas. Disability can't help because he's too paranoid to apply for benefits.  

&amp;#x200B;

All because he was stressed out and wanted to get high without it showing up on a drug test. Please don't do it.  If one person reading this is helped, then I'm grateful. 

Happy holidays, all.  Make good choices.
