LPT: Protect your ears against loud noise or get Tinnitus and regret it the rest of your life

content:
WEAR PPE. Don't ever do any loud work without ppe, or you'll be like me. I wore PPE for years while doing loud work. I decided ONE time to not put anything in my ears, and now I would trade everything I own to go back and slap myself. The only thing I can do now is attempt to warn others. This is a hell of my own design. Please don't let this happen to you or someone you love.

Edit: if you love smoking weed, say goodbye to that as it makes the ringing even louder.
