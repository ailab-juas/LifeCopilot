YSK: That a vitamin D deficiency can make you feel quite low, empty more depressed without realising

content:
Why YSK: Well I found out that I had a vitamin d deficiency(most likely because I’ve been indoors all the time) after having a blood test and a few days after taking my vitamin d supplements, I just felt much more happier, less empty compared to before and I’m sure I’m not the only one with this experience.

""41.6% of adults in the United States are deficient. This number goes up to 69.2% in Hispanic adults and 82.1% in African American adults"". Here in the UK 50% of asian people have a vitamin d deficiency which I fall under
