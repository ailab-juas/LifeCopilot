YSK: If a nurse tells you that you’re entitled to a second opinion, we think you probably should.

content:
If a nurse goes out of his or her way to tell you this, they either don’t like your doctor or don’t agree with him/her.   

We can’t tell you this outright, because it’s unethical (in some circumstances) and could get us in hot water.


Edit:  wow!  Never expected this to get so big. Thank you for all the awards.  

It should be mentioned that any advice from any nurse or doctor should be taken with a grain of salt and with consideration of your relationship to that person.  It also depends on the setting you are in. 

A second opinion isn’t a bad thing and often times doesn’t mean the diagnosis is incorrect BUT sometimes there is more than one way to deal with things. (Treatment for cancer, surgical vs. medical management etc ).   Sometimes it’s just nice to have two docs saying the same thing, especially when it comes to significant issues. 

I merely wanted to point out that because of the broken system sometimes things aren’t as they seem.  Just know if you have reservations or concerns you have the right to address them.
