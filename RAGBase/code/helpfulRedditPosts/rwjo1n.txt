YSK to protect your ears. Tinnitus is horrible and an eternal torment.

Why YSK:
I am 18 and I have had tinnitus for more than a year and it's horrible, my only wish now is to listen the sound of silence. Protect your ears when you go to a concert or places with loud noises. Use your headphones wisely. It is totally not worth it listening at high volumes for long periods. Stop it , you are literally pushing yourself into an eternal torment for rest of your life. If you wanna know what people in tinnitus are living with [this](https://youtu.be/83laYgUtbv8) is an example (skip to 1:23 for sound). Stop it, you will thank yourself.
