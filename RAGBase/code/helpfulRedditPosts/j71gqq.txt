LPT: Before ending a serious relationship, change 100% of all of your Passwords and remove your account info / auto login on ALL devices

I'm in the midst of hiring which is no small thing in this COVID world.  I had one applicant who stood head and shoulders above the rest, she was exactly what my org was looking for.  

Unfortunately, during the interview process she informed us via email she was no longer interested in the opportunity.  So, we moved on to our 2nd pick candidate.

Fast Forward 2 weeks.  I get a call from the applicant wondering if we had found someone and expressing interest in the job...  I told her that she said she wasn't interested and I showed her the email she sent us.  Apparently, she didn't send the email.  

She had recently broken up with her boyfriend during her applying for this job and he "hacked" into all her accounts and fucked her life up.  He deleted all of her social media and also sent us a false email saying she was no longer interested in the job.

Unfortunately, we hired someone so that opportunity is lost to her forever.

If you are in serious relationship then your partner has all of your passwords.  They do.  It is ridiculously easy to get someone's passwords if you have access to their phone or computer.  It is to your advantage to just assume someone you are serious with has all your passwords.  BEfore you break up with them you need to change all, yes ALL, of your passwords.  

It is amazing how evil and vindictive people can be when they are heartbroken.  Even so-called "nice" people can have a moment of temporary insanity after a break up and torch your whole life if they have the chance.  

Don't give them that chance.  Change your passwords
