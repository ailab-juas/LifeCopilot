LPT: Introduce yourself and get to know your neighbors - it's better than a security system!

content:
I know the current culture in the US is to just move in and do your thing, and I'd always done that. But my husband went out of his way to talk to and meet most of our neighbors when he moved into his house (before we met). They- and I- thought it was a little funny, touchy-feely.... 

but with all the hype and craze about predators being everywhere, I know we do not worry about our house/car being robbed because any time something weird happens we all let each other know. Weird van cruising slowly up the road looking at houses, a pair of dirty vagrants testing car doors, a package gets delivered while someone isn't home and we all group text so everyone knows about it and we can all either do something or just watch each others' backs. A sense of community is one of the best crime deterrents around where you live, and you don't even have to hang out and be "friends" to look out for each other, it's a mutually beneficial relationship.

Edit to clarify for those that think a one line LPT doesn't encompass every aspect of how life works. Obviously friendly neighbors are not a substitute for an alarm system. And if you have shitty neighbors this probably won't work either. Sorry about that, but it's worth a try.
