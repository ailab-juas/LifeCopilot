LPT: To start this year and decade with the right state of mind, set yourself to have one success every day and record it on a spreadsheet. It can be anything, no matter how big or small: learn a skill, call your family, finish a game, get a job, repair something, cook a nice meal or visit a museum.

Those are just examples. Anything goes.

Then, at the end of the year, reflect on the year that passed and witness your own growth.

Just don't be stressful over it if you cannot record anything absolutely every day, and allow repeats.
