LPT: Your life doesn’t need to be special to be enjoyable. Having a regular job, food to eat and a roof over your head is more than almost every person who came before you or living now has had/have. Stop comparing yourself to crazy talented lucky people.

My cousin is in her late 20s and going through this thinks she needs to be a (famous) artist because that’s her calling. I tell her you can always be an artist and find a way to earn a living along side. I don’t wake up excited to do my job every day but I get satisfaction out of it because it matches what I am good at and is new and different every day. 

Edit: Thanks for all the love! Also my first awards! If this helped one person understand that they are ok who and where they are in life I will be ecstatic!!

Edit 2: Clarity that she is a great artist just doesn’t have to make it or live some crazy artist lifestyle to be fulfilled. Added Famous in there.
