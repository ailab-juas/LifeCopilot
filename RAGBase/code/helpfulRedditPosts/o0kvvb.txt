LPT: When you tell someone you need to speak to someone at a later time, let them know what the subject matter is. It saves the person you need to speak with a lot of anxiety.

content:
For me personally, I already have a lot of things going on at any given moment and struggle with anxiety. Instead of saying “hey we need to talk” and refuse to give any context, say “hey when you get a chance I’d like to talk to you about X” or “hey later on I’ve got a couple questions about Y”. If people would let me know what needs to be discussed, I would have a better chance to have an intelligent discussion as opposed to entering the situation already on edge.

Edit: Damn. Went to sleep with 10 updoots, woke up with 25k and a ton of awards. Thank you all for the internet points, random strangers. Hopefully this is 25k fewer people that needlessly give someone crippling anxiety
