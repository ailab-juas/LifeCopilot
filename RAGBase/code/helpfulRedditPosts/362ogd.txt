LPT: If you're given criticism by an individual or a group. Bite the bullet, give yourself some time to process the emotions, then proceed to logically consider what was said.

Recently. Scientific research has been released to suggest that if we as individuals are presented with an idea which we disagree with, the portion of our brain which processes logic and reason turns off. So. If you're given criticism by lets say your boss, lover, and or someone in general, bite the bullet and give yourself time to process it. I am currently attempting to apply this idea to my life with my progression as a Toastmaster and a student of math and writing.
