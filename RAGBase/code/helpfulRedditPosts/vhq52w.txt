YSK: You can purchase prescription lenses online for a fraction of the price when compared to the lense store at the optometrist (without renewing your prescription.) 

Why YSK: You can save hundreds of dollars on prescription lenses by buying online.

I'm sure many people already know this, but I just learned this and I wanted to share! My vision has been relatively stable over the years, so this could have saved me bookoos of money.

There are several sites online to purchase quality frames/lenses for cheap. Zenni Optical is an example where you can get a set for as little as $7 +$5 shipping.

*You will need to know your prescription lens measurements to input into whatever site you choose.*

This is especially helpful for those of us without vision insurance and have a relatively consistent prescription.

Obviously, if your vision is changing or degrading significantly, you will need to renew your prescription as needed.
