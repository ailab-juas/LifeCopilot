LPT: Report eBay Price Gougers By Clicking the Three Dots in the Right Hand Corner, Hitting Report, and Selecting the Reason from the Drop Down Menu as Price Gouging

content:
Edit: including a comment I made below to explain why price gouging is wrong. 

The seller typically is the person clearing out the aisle and sitting on it. This behavior removes access to these items from anyone unable or unwilling to pay outrageously inflated fees.

This behavior is also why my cancer-ridden mother and her friends from the chemo center are unable to get their hands on any supplies. Her friends are dying because they don’t have access to things they need to protect themselves. No masks for the leukemia patients. No disinfectant for the lung cancer sufferers. It’s not fair or acceptable to profit by making another suffer.

So next time you see $120 Clorox wipes, remember they were taken away from someone without the ability to pay that price.

2nd Edit: Want to comment below how you’ve helped others during the pandemic? If so, then I’ll give out awards from the coins I’ve saved up for a moment like this (until they are gone). I just want to hear some uplifting stories in this dark time. Or comment a picture of your pets and tell me about them! Small or large, fluffy or hairless, eight legs or three. I just want to see what lights up your life! 

Either would bring a smile to my face (and hopefully others as well) ❤️

3rd Edit: Fuck it. Everyone gets an award until I’m out. You don’t even have to comment anything that related. Just keep it kind. Or write about something that makes you happy. You all deserve so much and I know everyone is fighting their own battles. Know I appreciate every single one of you reading this. Doesn’t matter if all you did today was lay in bed and stare at your phone. I’m still proud of you for doing your part and staying home. You are saving people like my parents. You are saving people like me who are still kids and might have to bury their parents. 

BUT! If you do want to comment or share your pet pics I would greatly appreciate any and all that you have! My animals are getting me through this and I definitely have enough room in my heart for a picture and story about yours as well 💕🐶🐠🐱🐭🕷

Final update: Hello everyone! Thank you so much for the support. I’m almost out of coins after using over 11,000 on giving out awards. While I no longer have much to offer, please still feel free to comment as I am reading every single one!
