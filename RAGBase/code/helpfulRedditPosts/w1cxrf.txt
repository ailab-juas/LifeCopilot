YSK about justwatch.com. it tells you all the platforms a movie is streaming on

content:
edit: also works with tv shows!

editedit: theres also an app!

why ysk: instead of finding a movie and then searching netflix, hulu, prime video, tubi, etc, use [justwatch.com](https://www.justwatch.com/). it shows you every platform the movie is available on

it seperates the platforms between free, subscription, and for renting/for buying, along with the prices for each platform. save a lot of time knowing instantly whether you have it or not

it also has all of the platforms. kanopy, criterion, hoopla, tubi, plutotv, appletv, and more. if a movie isnt available anywhere, theres an option for them to send you an email when it becomes available (without making an account/being on their email list). ive also found nearly every movie on it, from blockbusters to the obscure. best part? its all free
