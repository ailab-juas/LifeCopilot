LPT: If a company reaches out to you about a position and they attempt to give you a lower salary than you expected. Always ask if there are any other positions that will meet your salary requirements.

I was in a phone interview and was given a salary way below my range. I was speaking to the regional manager about why my desired salary was what it was and I expressed I would be willing to negotiate a higher position to meet my desired salary. He happily let me know he would discuss with his team about a solution to this problem not even an hour later they went ahead and offered me a higher position with 30% more pay.

Edit: To clarify I ended up with my desired salary plus 30%. Well it looks like I made it to the front page boyos thanks for the fake internet points I will cherish them forever!

Edit 2: oh wow my very first award I thank you greatly kind stranger! You are way too kind and I hope that award finds its way back to you some way!
