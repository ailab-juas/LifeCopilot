YSK: There is a genealogy website that most likely provides much of you and your family's private information to the general public. You can and should easily opt out of it.

content:
The website is https://familytreenow.com

&amp;nbsp;

It displays information about people including your full name, age, year of birth, current and past addresses, and family members to anybody who wants to look you up.

Luckily it's pretty easy to get your information off the site, read this link for more info:
