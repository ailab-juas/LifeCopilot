YSK that Target.com grants price adjustments if something you purchased goes on sale.

content:
I know many people are aware that Target does price matching with their competitors, however, they also do price adjustments if something that you purchased from *them* ends up going on sale.  
  
I recently purchased a furniture piece from Target.com, and I discovered a few days later that it was on sale for $30 less. I used the chat feature on the Target website and explained this to the rep, and they refunded me the $30 with no issues. I just had to provide my original order #, my email address, and the name of the item I was referring to.  
  
I then had another discovery that some chairs that I purchased were on sale for $22 off of what I originally paid. Again, they refunded me the difference no questions asked, and this was about three weeks after the initial purchase.  
  
So if you've made a purchase on Target.com lately, it may be worth occasionally checking back on the product page for price drops.
