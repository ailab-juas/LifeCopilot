LPT: When planning for a wedding, get pricing from caterers, florists, tables/chairs, etc. as just a party, not a “wedding”.

content:
We were shocked with pricing for food, alcohol, DJ, caterers, florists, basically everything associated with the wedding. Its a total scam. It’s like, we’ve ordered food for let’s say work events and it’s way less. So we stopped telling them it was a wedding. Literally prices were half. If/when they find out it’s a wedding, not only is it too late but it doesn’t matter, nothing has changed. It’s just a party after all.

EDIT: No need for anyone to get offended. Of course there are tons of exceptions and some weddings this wouldn’t apply. For us we did a large very casual wedding and it just didn’t need all the same attention as maybe a more traditional one.

Edit 2: Plenty of good and bad feedback. The basic sense is that you can get a simple version of food and alcohol for a simple wedding. If you have a very specific wedding with times and people and place settings and agendas and all the bells and whistles, it doesn’t make sense. And god of course if you have a contract and you breach it that’s an entirely different thing. 

If someone needs a “wedding planner” than let’s just say this doesn’t apply to them.
