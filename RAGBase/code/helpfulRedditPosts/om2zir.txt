LPT: Let new co-workers know it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, stressed and make mistakes. Tell them when they’ve done good too. They’ll never forget who was nice to them when they were the most vulnerable.

This may seem like a small thing or something minor but it is the exact opposite. Being a decent and understanding person to someone who’s new in a job can make a HUGE impact on good rapport between co-workers and in the workplace. Being the “new co-worker” is often times a scary experience paired with lots of emotions like anxiety, insecurity and doubt. To validate someone in telling and showing them it is okay and very normal to make mistakes in the beginning (and beyond too) and to feel like you can’t live up to the job’s expectation not only is a form of empathy and compassion towards someone who’s in a vulnerable position but helps them to feel less pressured to be perfect. Being the new person, you hold no power, no relationships and no real practical knowledge and you do feel vulnerable. When people feel vulnerable, they’re more prone to remember what people did do to them, good or bad because they’re more emotionally driven. They’ll never forget who was nice to them when they had the least power, you’ll always be “that” person to them. However, don’t do it out of that motive but because you want to be a good and decent person who’s not an asshole to new co-workers. Because they’ll also remember who was an asshole to them when they first started.
