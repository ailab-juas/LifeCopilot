LPT: never remove the headrests from your vehicle. Their main purpose isn’t decorative, it’s to save your/your passengers neck from whiplash (or worse) in an accident. Headrests are equal to seatbelts, airbags, and other safety equipment in your likelihood to escape injury.

Recently a friend of mine bought a used car from a large dealership group. She was super excited about the car, rightfully so. She brought it over to show me, and I asked where the rear headrests where. She said the dealer told her that when it came in, it didn’t have them. We talked through their importance, and I recommended we call the dealership to get them replaced. Shocker, the dealer said there was “nothing he could do as it wasn’t negotiated beforehand.” 

This was quickly rectified with a strongly worded email to the general manager and they were ordered and delivered quickly. 

I understand sometimes headrests need to me removed in order to fold seats down. Always make sure you keep track of where you store them, and put them back before you have passengers again. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

Edit: wow, this blew up. Thank you strangers for the awards. 

I meant this post to increase awareness and safety. I fully realize this is a personal choice by all, but also to alert passengers riding in other peoples cars or ride shares. 

A few comments around vernacular of head restraints or head rests (I chose to use head rests as they’re commonly referred to as that, rather than their technical name of restraints). 

Edit 2: 
Huge thanks to everyone who brought up that this is NOT the case when dealing with child’s car seats. I’m not a parent so am not familiar. 

Stay safe out there y’all!
