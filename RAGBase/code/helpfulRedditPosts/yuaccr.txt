LPT: If you buy a defective item or appliance from a big box Home Improvement store, write the nature of the defect all over the box before you return it. That way they are forced to process it and send it back to the distributor rather than put it back on the shelf.

For example if you bought a new toilet and the tank has a hairline crack which leaks write, "cracked tank" on the box sides and top in sharpie. I have found far too many broken and defective items for sale in big box stores because if they have any opportunity to resell it they will.
