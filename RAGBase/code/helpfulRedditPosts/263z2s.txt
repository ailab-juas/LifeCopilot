LPT: How to hear someone easily in a noisy club

content:
When you're in a club / at a gig etc. and the music is too loud to hear what your friend is saying: Gently push your [tragus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragus_%28ear%29) into one ear thereby closing it and shutting out a lot of incoming frequencies from the room. Point this closed ear towards your friend's mouth and they can then literally shout and not only will it not hurt you - you'll easily be able to hear what they're saying.
