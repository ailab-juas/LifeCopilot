LPT: if your kid is a picky eater, introduce new food outside of already emotionally charged mealtimes

content:
If meal time is already a struggle introduce new food outside of it and with no expectation that they will eat it, offer them the chance to be able to say no without you seething or arguing or pleading like they might see at meal times.    

Tell them about the food, show them what it looks like, how it's prepared, let them handle it, touch and smell before it's prepared/cooked.   
When possible involve them when buying it, let them choose one new fruit or vegetable, pick something at random by designating a color for the day.   
Let them smell the spice cabinet and tell you what smells nice to them and go from there. Try things without seasoning and then with seasoning.

Teach them the vocabulary they need to tell you what they like about it and what they don't like, maybe it's taste, maybe it's texture.  It will help you rule out mild allergies, cilantro tasting like soap gene, texture aversion...       

Tell them about what you like and what you don't like and how sometimes you have to eat things you are not fond of and it's not the end of the world.   
  
Imagine how you'd react if someone put some unrecognizable foodstuff in front of you and told you you had no option but to eat it - you'd want to know what it is, what to expect taste wise.
