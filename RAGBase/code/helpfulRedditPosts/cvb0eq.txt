title:
YSK a technique for dealing with scary images or thoughts when trying to sleep.

content:
Common for kids, not uncommon in adults, to watch a scary movie or think something scary and not be able to sleep.  

Rather than try not to think about it, which is very difficult, let yourself think about it but control the narrative.  Can't stop picturing Jason from Friday the 13th?  Think of him walking into your backyard and a giant bird flying overhead and pooping on his head.  

Imagine the scary person walking into your kitchen and slipping on a banana peel, hitting his head and yelling, "Shit" while peeing himself.  

Or image a pack of dogs waiting for him and chasing him around town, etc.
