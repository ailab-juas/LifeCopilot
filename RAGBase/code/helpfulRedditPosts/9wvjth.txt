LPT: If someone tries to teach you how to do something let them even if you already know. You may learn how to do it a different way.

content:
This is especially true in training/internship situations. If someone wants to teach you something never shut them down and say “I already know how to do that.” Be open to learning a different way or possibly a different perspective on something. 

It’s will also save you from upsetting them if you mess up doing that thing later, since they taught you how to do it.
