title:
LPT: Don't "six months" yourself to death.

content:
This is a piece of advice my dad gave me over the weekend and I'd like to share it with you. 

He has been working for a company for well over ten years. This is a large commercial real estate company and he manages a local property for them. He has been there over 10 years, and for the first few there were plans to develop the property into a large commercial shopping center. Those plans fell through and now the property owner is trying to attract an even larger client for the entire property. 

However this attraction process is taking its dear sweet time. They keep telling him "six more months, six more months..." - that was about three years ago. Now the day to day drudgery is catching up to him and he's not happy. He recently interviewed for a position that would pay him almost triple his salary and would reinvigorate his love for his career. 

So, the LPT is...don't wait. Don't keep telling yourself six more months. If you have an opportunity, take it. If you can create an opportunity, create it. 

Grab life by the horns and shake!

Good luck!
