YSK on an iPhone, if you can’t copy the text on a page (like it’s a picture), take a screenshot, then long-press the text in the screenshot. It should recognize the text and let you copy the text.

I was trying to copy a comment that wouldn’t post, but the app wouldn’t allow me to copy the text. Took a screenshot and copied from there. It’s handy!

Why YSK? It can come in handy when having to copy text that you can’t normally select. I just used it to copy the number off my virtual ID card to use at an online store.
