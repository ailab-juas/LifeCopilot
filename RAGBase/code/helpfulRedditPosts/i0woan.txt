LPT: Don't be afraid to break up with your friends.

content:
This applies to long term friends, colleagues and mostly people who you have been dragging around as baggage simply because you 'were' friends at some point. The duration of the friendship leads them to believe they can get away with saying, doing or implying just about anything that affects your mood, your confidence or your self worth. It's absolutely important that you don't  give them even a moments notice before you shut them down with absolutely zero filters. Let me explain with an example:

X and I have been friends for quite some time. We were even roommates at some point. We haven't really spoken since graduation apart from the occasional responses and reactions to the snaps, instagrams stories and everything of the sort. Recently, I needed some constructive feedback for a podcast I'm planning to release and sent the first intro episode to a group we're both members in.Everyone shot back with pointers and generally, great insight on what I could do, to make it better. About a day later, X responds: "Lol. Podcasting now eh, Jay Shitty?".

I'm certain he hasn't even listened to it, nor was he adding any value of any sort. So I convinced myself that it was time to cut it off with him. I shot back, "You're never too late to remind me why we aren't friends anymore". He hasn't responded to it, but I honestly feel like I've lost a little bit of the additional baggage that's come with living into your early 20's. The least I could do is to filter some people out of it.

So my advice to you again, don't be afraid to break up with your "friends".
