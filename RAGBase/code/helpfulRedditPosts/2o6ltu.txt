LPT: If you're having trouble deciding on a good gift for someone, tell them you already got them something amazing and have them guess what it is.

content:
There's your list of things that they think would be amazing gifts.

Edit: Apparently this is either a brilliant idea ... or I'm a stupid lying liar moron and should kill myself. Well, all I can say is if I've helped only one person -- and pissed off a hundred others -- then I've done my job.

For those saying that it's a bad idea because it could get expensive, etc., just use some finesse. Instead of saying you got something "amazing" say you got something "really cool even though it doesn't cost a lot" or something like that. There are tons of ways you can rephrase the statement to tailor it to your particular situation.
