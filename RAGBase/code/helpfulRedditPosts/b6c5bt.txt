YSK: Saliva is great at removing fresh blood stains (from paper cuts, periods, etc.)

content:
This is something I learned from a friend who was both a neat-freak and a wilderness survival responder. It works remarkably well! I don't understand why, since the main enzymes in human saliva are good for breaking down starches. But, I swear by this; it works far better than club soda, in my experience!
