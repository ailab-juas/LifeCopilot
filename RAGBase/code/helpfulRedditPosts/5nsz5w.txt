LPT: when making rice, just throw some broccoli on top when there is like 10mins left, it'll be perfectly steamed at the end and is a super easy way to add some nutrition with virtually zero extra work!

I just thought of this on a whim one day and have been doing it ever since. It's SO easy and works great.

(Note: by the time there's 10 minutes left, the water level should be below the "rice level" so the broccoli isn't gonna be submerged or anything, they just rest on top)

(Note^2 can also do this with quinoa if you're into that)
