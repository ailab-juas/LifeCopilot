LPT: Make it a rule for yourself to NEVER insult how another person finds joy or expresses joy

content:
I.e their hobbies and their smile. It’s incredibly sad when some covers their mouth or face in the middle of a joyous moment because they were always told that the gap in their teeth looks weird or that they have an overbite.

In addition, seeing people never share anything about what makes them happy because their parents or their peers always tell them that their hobby of painting and collecting figurines is lame and childish.

This is one of the times that you should just keep that opinion to yourself

Edit: Christ on a bike, if someone derives joy to the detriment of others you call them out, if it’s illegal you call a cop.
