LPT - Beware of companies trying to move you from hourly to salary for the same job

content:
They will try to make it sound like it's a good thing for you and you'll make more money.  Usually it just means you work too many hours and they want to save some money.  Before agreeing to anything, say you need some time to think it over and either take the contract to a lawyer, or look it over with a fine toothed comb.

This is country specific.  My apologies if it doesn't apply to you
