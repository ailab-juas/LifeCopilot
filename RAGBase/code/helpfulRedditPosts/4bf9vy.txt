LPT: Write down the serial numbers of all of the expensive items you own. If it gets stolen, it's much easier to prove that the item is yours if it's found.

This especially applies to more portable items, like cameras or music gear that you bring to performances.

Thankfully I've never had to rely on this, but I know it will definitely help me one day if something is stolen. It's MUCH easier to say "I'm looking for X piece of equipment with serial 1234567" vs trying to identify it using a certain scuff or marking.

Edit: lots of people are also mentioning taking a video of the inside of your home, including major possessions, and then backing up that video. This is also a really good idea.
