title:
YSK that Hartz flea &amp; tick products are known for killing hundreds of cats and dogs every year

content:
It's all word of mouth, but you can find hundreds of reports on the internet about people who either lost their pets or almost lost their pets due to seizures and other adverse reactions from Hartz products, usually flea &amp; tick (spray, collars, wash, etc.)

Google "Hartz kills pets" and you'll see.

I won't be surprised if the company eventually shuts down, but in the meantime, please spend the few extra dollars to get a nicer product that your pet is less likely to have an adverse reaction to. It could save their life!
