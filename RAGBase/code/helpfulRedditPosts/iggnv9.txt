LPT: If you wave first, it’s not awkward.

content:
I learned this awhile ago from a goofy person who lived life with a lot of adventurous fun. He said “if you wave first, it takes the awkward off you and puts it on the other person.”

Example:
-If you get caught pissing in the woods, wave first and the other person gets awkward. 
-If you’re singing in your car hella crazy feeling it and people are staring, wave and make them feel awkward for staring.
