YSK that a lot of bargains on black friday are actually cheaper, crappier versions of the real thing

content:
If you're eyeing that nice new 55" UHDTV from Best Buy, know that a lot of the products sold on Black Friday are made solely for that day and manufacturers will make it seem like you're buying the same thing you saw at 4x the price the week before, when in fact, the model number is ever so slighty different and lacks a lot of the features of the other model.

And this goes far further then just TVs.

The Nintendo switch for example is going to be on sale but what you may not know is that it is the older version, with much worse battery life then the new, currently SAME PRICE model.
