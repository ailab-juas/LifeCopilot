title:
YSK how to unsend an email from your gmail account.

content:
Settings &gt; Labs &gt; 'Undo Send' &gt; Enable

This gives you 30 seconds to 'unsend' an email after you hit send, if you've forgotten an attachment, sent it to the wrong recipient or realized a spelling error.

Edit: Some of the other things in 'Labs' might be useful to you too, so it is worth checking out. You can have a preview panel (like in hotmail) and customize your google chat. I found the undo to be the most useful though :)
