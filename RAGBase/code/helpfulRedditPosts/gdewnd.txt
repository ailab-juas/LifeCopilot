LPT: Don’t burden yourself with trying to change people’s viewpoints online. It’s rarely successful and likely frustrates you more than it’s worth. Remind yourself it’s not your job.

Good natured discussion is always healthy, but if you find yourself getting upset – remind yourself its not your job to change that person’s mind, and you likely won’t succeed. 

Not your monkey, not your circus.
