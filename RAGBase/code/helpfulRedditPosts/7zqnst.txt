title:
YSK that Truvia (Erythritol sweetener) sets off a false positive as an explosive at TSA

content:
I was just detained for almost an hour because they thought my bottle of artificial sweetener powder was an explosive. If they are using their swab cloths and that machine they scan it in, you will set it off. I was chatting with the TSA special agent they brought over and he said it wasnâ€™t the first time this has happened.Be wary of this if you ever consider flying with your diet accouterment.
