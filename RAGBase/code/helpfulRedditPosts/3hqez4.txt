YSK to keep stray kittens around for at least 2 months before taking them to the shelter as it greatly improves their survival rate.

I learned the hard way. 

I adopted a wee stray from the shelter and simply, it died from FIP and not thriving according to the vet. 

I was also told that due to the stress caused by shelters, baby kittens don't have a strong enough immune system yet to make a healthy start. 

I know a litter in your yard can be frustrating, but if you just gave them some time, the several vets said that most strays make it because being outside at that age helps them thrive. 

My heart broke because I thought I was doing the right thing by picking the youngest (I know, I know), but I truly thought he'd pull through. 

**Edit: No I did not keep kittens, I adopted an infected one from someone who brought a litter in too young to thrive**
