YSK That the HPV vaccine is just as useful for men as is it is for women.

content:
HPV is transmitted between people. Thats means guy gives to girl, girl gives to another guy ect. If one of those people are vaccinated you can cut the transmission rate down. Even if the vaccine's target are the strains that typically effect women, it is still better for men to NOT be a vector.

Also some strains can cause dick warts.
