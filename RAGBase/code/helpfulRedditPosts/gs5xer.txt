LPT : if you need to call into a call center for help, call early in the morning, between 7am and 9am for the best, more experienced reps.

content:
Most Call Centers have shift bids where the best agents can select their shifts. The most tenured, experiences, highest rated customer service agents are usually ranked higher and get top priority in their shift selections. Of course these folks will want to work Monday - Friday and select a 7am-4pm or 8-5 or 9-6 shift to let them be home with their families evening and weekends. 

This means the best shot you have at getting a rep who can fix the problem and be understanding will be someone between 7am and 9am. The later you wait to call the higher likelihood you’ll talk to someone new or bad at their job. 

Yes, there’s still a % of people who are good at their jobs and prefer working a later shift but that is a small %.
