LPT: When selling things online, meet at the Police Station.

content:
All police stations in the US &amp; Canada allow for the transaction of online sales to be conducted in front of their property (i.e. side walk, designated area, or parking lot.) This is a great way to make sure you don't get ripped off/mugged/robbed when meeting to exchange. [SafeTrade Stations Resource. ](http://www.safetradestations.com/where-to-trade.html)

Edit:
Summation of My Learning Experience

1. This is not the most ideal situation for any illegal trade. As so many original Redditors have established.

2. Alternatives include but are not limited to: Banks [my new fave], Fire Stations, Casinos [kinda cool] and "crowded places." (Not everyone is comfortable with the police.)

3. There's a lot of cool stories out there of people using this system.

4. There are many scary stories out there from people who haven't. 

5. There are a few crazy instances of violence in spite.

6. This applies to both buyers and sellers. Sorry I missed on the title.


Edit 2:
-Try to remember not everyone is able to "look after themselves"
- Received a lot of messages about large items...so since no one read the resource. [Here it is again - Can't Transport](http://www.safetradestations.com/how-to-trade.html)
