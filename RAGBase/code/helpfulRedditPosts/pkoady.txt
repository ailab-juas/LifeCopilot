title:
YSK: A lot of newer cars have a ‘soft’ turn signal for lane switching and other short term direction change notifications

content:
The ‘soft’ signal is when you pull the turn signal before it clicks and it blinks just a few times (versus when you pull the lever fully you need to turn for it to stop).

Why YSK: Signals are really helpful to alert other cars and pedestrians that you’re going to change direction, which helps mitigate accidents.

Bumped into a few people recently with cars that had this feature, but they weren’t aware. If awareness of this feature can increase signal usage, that’d be cool.
