LPT: If you're struggling with a concept and are looking for help or more information, Google the subject with "site:.edu" and "type:.ppt". This will give you powerpoint lectures from universities.

Not sure how widely known/used this is, but the combination of the two have saved me many, many times in economics. Sometimes it just needs to be explained in a different way for me to get it.

edit: Glad I could help some people out! The search that inspired this post was me looking for information on the economics concept of the Solow Model. I typed into google:

&gt;solow model site:.edu type:.pptx

and got a couple helpful slides from colleges and universities.

Doing the same thing but replacing .pptx with .pdf also brought up lecture outlines (the first two were from MIT and William &amp; Mary) which are just as helpful.

Another example is 

&gt;site:.edu type:pptx design patterns

(thanks, /u/baggerboot!)

Also, thanks to /u/Malagate for the tip on .pptx to return more recent presentations, and thanks to a bunch of you for the tip that .pdf brings up great things as well!

Another edit: thanks to /u/luigibrotha for [this great link](http://geoscience.wisc.edu/geoscience/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/google1.gif) which explains even more tips!

Bonus lpt: sometimes adding type:.pdf instead of type:.ppt allows you to find additional homework problems and solutions.

Good luck studying, everyone!
