YSK that self-degradation when you are anxious and uncertain can be a semi-intentional coping mechanism similar to self-harm.

Why YSK:

When something has gone wrong, you've made a mistake, or you find yourself in a conflict, or maybe looking at a scary upcoming problem, it is very easy to slip into degrading yourself. To tear into your intelligence, your morals, your willpower. 

And part of that is because, like how physical self-harm clears away other emotions with a stronger one and gives you a sense of action, depression and darkness easily replaces that fear. **It feels better to be sad than scared.** Sadness can be cried out, depression eventually numbs, anguish quickly replaces the tenseness and terror - whereas anxiety and fear can keep buzzing forever. 

But like physical self-harm, the short term escape will not be worth the long-term damage as depressive episodes build up and you start to believe your worst feelings.

It's better to resist and try to think positive and constructive, even though it is harder and the anxiety symptoms will last longer.

Edit:

This has a lotta upvotes so I wanna say:

- I'm not a psychologist.

- While I've had this as a toxic defense mechanism, maybe not everybody does. I suffer mostly from anxiety with depression sort of as a side-effect, and not say, major depressive disorder.

- By "think constructive", I of course don't mean you should repress your negative feelings. It's just like physical self-harm: just don't actively try to cause yourself harm, it's not good for you, but mostly this post is just about being aware if this applies to you :)
