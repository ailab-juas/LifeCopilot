LPT: Set up and clear out your Voicemail if you're applying for jobs.

content:
I'm currently in the process of trying to hire some new employees for the company I work at. I've honestly been surprised by the number of applicants I just can't get in contact with because they either haven't set up a voicemail or have one that's full.

In the past few days I've easily made well over 2 dozen calls and have only managed to reach or leave a voicemail with maybe 5 applicants total.

Seriously people, if you're looking for work; which I'm betting many people are or will be soon thanks to covid, then set your voicemail up and empty it out after you start putting in applications.
