YSK you can save $50 at oil changes by replacing your own air and cabin filters for $18 and 10 minutes of your time.

Oil change places don't make a whole lot on the oil change itself, especially if you get a coupon (check the store or dealer's website for coupons, they often have them for oil changes). But - it's a regular way to guarantee a customer has to come in.

Once in, they try to sell you various things. Always, they will say your air filter (which filters air going into the engine, for combustion) and cabin filter (filters the fresh air going into the passenger area) are "dirty" and offer to replace them for $20, $30, sometimes $40 each.

NEVER say yes. (\*\*EDIT: apparently some makes/models (Hondas from 2000 or earlier, Ford Fusions, maybe others) you have to actually disassemble part of the dash, the radiator assembly, or both, in order to replace one or the other filter - so make sure to double-check online first.)

You can buy replacement filters for $5-15 bucks, and a Youtube search for "air filter replace" plus your model and year of car, and you can (\*\*EDIT: "usually") replace it in under 10 minutes.

This is one of the most outrageous upsells. I had to post this after I got my oil change this morning, said my customary "no thanks" to the "we can replace your cabin and engine air filters for you" - and then I overheard a single mom in the bay next to me paying $160 for a FRICKING OIL CHANGE AND "FILTER REPLACEMENT." UGH!!! So angry. I went up to her outside and told her, and she was so shocked, and thanked me afterward.
