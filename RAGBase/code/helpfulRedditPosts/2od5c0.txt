LPT: Mac Book users, hover your mouse over any word and tap three fingers on the track pad to see the definition, as well as Thesaurus and Wiki entries.

content:
This works on Yosemite and works on any text in browser, text editors, PDF readers etc...

Extras:

*/u/Bullz-Eye :

&gt;http://www.bettertouchtool.net/[1] With this program you use your trackpad so much more efficient

*/u/thread_pool :

&gt;You don't need a Macbook to do this. On a regular Mac, you can hover over the target word, and press Control+Command+D to get the definition.

*/u/Nonsensicallity :

&gt;Another thing, if you have other languages installed on your keyboard, it'll give you the definition of that word in another language as if you had an x language to English dictionary.
