title:
LPT: If someone who barely knows you treats you poorly, don't take it personally. They were a jerk long before you ever met them.

content:
People are the sum of their genetics and upbringing. Their behavior is baked in, so by the time you meet them they are not interacting with you based on who *you* are and what you have done, they are being driven by what has happened to *them* in their own past.

So, when someone treats you like shit, the only emotion you can feel for them is empathy for the sorry life they must have led. I have replied to insults this way: "I am sorry you feel that way. What terrible things happened to you in your past for you to treat people so poorly?"

But there are two sides to this coin!
Please remember an old saying: "Insults don't have to be *given* to be *taken*."
If someone says something to you and you feel insulted, take a second to think about why you are feeling that way. Because you, too, are the result of your genetics and upbringing!
EDIT. Thanks for the awards!
