LPT: Since there are reports that the United States Government will possibly be sending money by check or direct deposit to American citizens "shortly," the FTC has made a list of three important tips to keep in mind.

content:
The details are still being worked out, but there are a few really important things to know:

1. The government will not ask you to pay anything up front to get this money. No fees. No charges. No nothing.

2. The government will not call to ask for your Social Security number, bank account, or credit card number. Anyone who does is a scammer.

3. These reports of checks aren’t yet a reality. Anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer.

Predict that the scammers are gearing up to take advantage of this.  So, remember: no matter what this payment winds up being, only scammers will ask you to pay to get it. If you spot one of these scams, please tell the Federal Trade Commission: [www.ftc.gov/complaint](http://www.ftc.gov/complaint). W

Edit 3: WOW THIS BLEW UP, THAT'S AWESOME! Lots of questions in the comments about the $1,000 - Please keep in mind this post is to educate yourself and others about the scammers that have probably already started scamming people. 

Edit 2: if you sort by ‘Q&amp;A’ I made a‘copy text’ so you can share these three tips easily

Edit: since this has exploded (which I am grateful for!) I would like to also point out some things...

I’m not sure of the numbers but people fall for the classic “CONGRATULATIONS MR/MRS; PRINCE of x country wants to give you a MILLION dollars!!!!! if you give us your information” all of the time. And that is 100% a lie, but people STILL FALL FOR IT. 

Think about this.. the news is telling people the government is giving them $1000. So when someone calls requesting their information, the news told them its happening so it has to be true. Like, holy shit people! This is going to get so many people and it’s not getting the attention it deserves on a national level! 

Please please please spread this! If I could I’d trade all the awards (thank you for them) on this post to save ONE person from being scammed out of (what is probably) their life savings I would. Thank you everyone. Please spread this!
