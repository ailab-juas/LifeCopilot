title:
LPT: when you move into your first home/ apartment, the first thing you should always do is know where to shut off the water, gas, and power to your home.

content:
I’ve seen too many videos of people just standing around in their home when a leak/full force water jet is spraying in their home, or gas leaks happening but people don’t know what to do about them. Knowing where these three things are will save you a huge mess that you’ll later have to deal with.

Edit: I just realized that in the title I said “first” place, I meant every new place you move into, thanks u/bingold49
