LPT: Getting rid of random erections. (NSFW)

content:
Blokes, we've all been there. For no apparent reason, you just end up with your down below going upwards. So, all you need to do is tilt your feet back onto your heels, and you should feel your calf muscles stretching. This will take the blood from your gentleman's area and sends it too your legs instead. After a minute or so your issue should be gone.

Edit: Jesus Christ guys front page,  thank you :)

Edit 2: /u/KoleCasule1 and others also pointed out another method of getting rid of the stubborn stiffy is too hold your breath for 15-30 seconds. Tried it and it works, so thanks to you guys for teaching me something new

Edit 3: Thank you so much for the gold :D
