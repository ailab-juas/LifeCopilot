LPT: Don't avoid photos during gatherings; you'll want more of them one day.

content:
I've always been self conscious about how I look in pictures, but as I get older and people move or pass away, I wish I had taken/been in more group/family photos. It's easy to take time for granted. Take advantage of photo opportunities while you can.


Edit: This advice was never meant to focus exclusively on family. No one should ever feel encouraged to immortalize time spent in an unhealthy situation or environment. I worded this advice broadly because I hope that those who experience difficult family dynamics can enjoy valuable connections elsewhere with whomever they call loved ones.
