LPT: When flying with an airline that makes you pay for specific seats; first choose 'randomly allocated seats', then only half of you have to pay to sit next to another.

Just to clarify, I'm flying with the horrendously famous RyanAir, who make you pay for each sheet of paper you wipe your....you get the point.

Check-in online ASAP. 

If you are a family of 4 for example, then choose randomly allocated seats first. Then each parent can pay to sit next to their child rather than 4 people all individually paying for 4 seats. 

If your child gets allocated to a seat where there's no seats next to them, then this time you lose. But otherwise, this usually works. 

This should be free if you have children, but it's not.
