LPT: If you have a plant in the audience, don't have them ask well thought-out friendly questions, have them ask rude, dumb questions. It will do a lot more to get the audience on your side.

content:
A vendor came in yesterday to discuss a competing product to what we already have. One guy who spent his life learning the competing product interrupted the vendor to rudely ask dumb questions throughout the presentation. Many of these questions were obvious or just answered a slide or 2 ago. 

Never before was I so strongly rooting for a vendor to shut someone down. By the end, the angry guy appeared won over, which convinced the rest of us even if we weren't 100% sold on the product. People are weird  when it comes to decision making. 

Edit: Since many people are confused by my use of 'plant', I mean it as a noun, like shill, accomplice, or confederate. Someone secretly on your side to trick others, mostly used negatively.
