title:
YSK there is an app called Be My Eyes that allows visually impaired people to video call volunteers to ask for visual assistance

content:
Why YSK: The app is free to download and you can sign up as a volunteer or a visually impaired / blind person. If you need visual help (examples given are picking the right colour of an item of clothing, or the right brand of product when shopping) and you are visually impaired, you press a button on the app. The app will call multiple volunteers (volunteers do not need to have the app open to recieve a call, they just have to be logged in) , and whoever picks up the quickest is connected by video call. The volunteer can then assist you in whatever task you need help with.

Thought it was a great idea and a helpful app. Currently there are over 4 million volunteers signed up, but only 310, 000 visually impaired or blind people. Thought I'd share in case anyone would find this useful.

Edit: To clarify - you don't need to be actively on the app/ have it opened all day to receive calls, but you do need to have the app running in the background. It helps to open the app manually once every few days.

Edit 2: I understand there are more volunteers than visually impaired people using the app, that's why I quoted the number of users in my original post. I shared it on here in case there were visually impaired people using Reddit that weren't aware of the app and would  find it helpful. It's a great thought that so many people are willing to help others that a volunteer can go years without getting a call- far better to have too many volunteers than too few!
