title:
LPT; De-Escalating a Karen

content:

TL:DR; when you’re a bystander in a victim/harasser conflict, a good way to de escalate and show support is to engage in friendly conversation with the victim. Especially if you aren’t comfortable engaging the aggressor. 

At the checkout line, the cashier was a little inexperienced and was having trouble with her machine. As she waited for help I smiled at her and patiently waited, noticing that she was becoming more flustered as people began queuing behind me. An older gentleman put his groceries on the belt and began to complain loudly and rudely about how long this was taking. I don’t normally think of a good way to approach awkward social situations but something in my brain clicked that day. As she became more uncomfortable and flustered I shifted slightly between them and began complimenting the cashier’s curly hair (mine is naturally curly as well and it can be a pain). I kept her engaged in conversation until a manager arrived and fixed her computer.  You don’t have to engage the harasser to show someone you have their back.

Edit; For those in the comments saying I should have called the guy out; I am 5 feet tall and somewhat introverted. Confronting this person for his rude behavior was not something I could have handled well.  I do not trust people to not be violent and I preferred not to draw any attention to myself. This advice was meant for those who are not comfortable with direct confrontation.

Second Edit; I used Karen to mean ‘dealing with an unhappy customer’. This tip could work with whichever gender.
