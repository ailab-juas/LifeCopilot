LPT: Extend your home network wifi/boost signal strength by using your PC as a virtual router

content:
Using software you can turn your PC into a hotspot (I use Codeplex's Virtual Router Manager).

It shares the wired connection and broadcasts a virtual wifi network for your devices to connect to, allowing a more stable connection in that area.
