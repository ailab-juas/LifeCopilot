LPT: if your family member/spouse dies, contact an attorney before you pay a single bill sent by bill collectors for that person. In a lot of cases their debt dies with them but if they can collect from you they will.

In some states in the US even spouses aren't responsible for debts solely in the other's name. Be sure before you pay anything. It can also become your debt if you start paying it in some cases.
