LPT: Before you open a bag of cereal, take it out of the box and put it back upside down. You'll mix up the small and large pieces and avoid getting a bowl of crumbs at the end of the box

content:
Any cereal with non-uniform piece sizes will, over the course of shipping and handling, mix itself up unfavorably. The large pieces stay on top, the small pieces fall toward the bottom, and the crumbs end up at the bottom of the bag. 

Before you open the bag of cereal, take it out, flip it upside down, and replace it in the box. Give it a few good shakes to distribute the crumbs throughout the bag, and then open the bag from the bottom. This will help the large pieces now at the bottom work themselves up as they get displaced by the small ones, and you'll be much less likely to get a bowl entirely of crumbs at the end of the bag.

Caveat: Some cereal bags are more reinforced at the bottom (so the bag is normally easier to open) so take care opening or you get [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/rfYRr.jpg)


Edit 1: After you flip the bag, put it immediately back in the box while the bag is still slender. If you shake it or handle it too much before putting it back in you just get a frumpy sack of cereal that makes your box fat. 

Edit 2: LPT: If you all like crumbs so damn much why don't you just smash the whole bag of cereal till that's all you've got
