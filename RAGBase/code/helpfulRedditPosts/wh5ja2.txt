LPT: Always mute yourselves when on hold with a call center

content:
I've been managing call centers for 10 years now(telcoms), most people know that their conversations are being recorded but what most people fail to realize is that the recording can begins as soon as you're in the queue and the music is playing and keeps going even when you're put on hold or mute, EVERYTHING is be recorded. So if you're not speaking to an employee mute yourselves and keep your privacy.

*On a side note, you can't imagine the number of Karens and male-karens I caught flat out lying to us with this trick, I always have a good time exposing them to their lies and lay out the the facts and a summary of what can be heard. Always makes my day! If you're gonna lie to a company for your own benefit, at least mute yourselves before bragging about it to your SO or your friends. As you can Imagine, this is only the tip of the iceberg!*
