LPT: Since it's getting colder, go through your coats and blankets and put the ones you don't care about in your car. They'll come in handy if you break down, or if you come across someone who needs them, you can give them away.

Edit: Wow, I never expected something I posted would blow up so much, I'm glad it's this one! I did this for years, and this year am in a place I can't and hoped to pass it on to those who could. 

I understand it's dangerous to keep some things lying out in your car, but a pair of gloves and the dry clean socks that u/incirrata suggested could go in your glove box! Or a thermal blanket, as u/KnownMonk suggested. Or just throw a ratty old blanket in your back seat, as u/byedangerousbitch said, no one breaks into your car to steal trash!

And I'm sorry to everyone in the southern hemisphere, but I love u/Shroudroid 's response to remind them in six monthsüòÜ

If you are one of the people without an extra coat, hopefully someone who has one in there car can give you theirs if you get stranded without it.

To everyone I hope you stay warm this winter (or next, if you're south of the equator!)‚ù§
