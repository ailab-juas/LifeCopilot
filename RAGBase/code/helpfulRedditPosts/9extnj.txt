LPT: Do NOT crank it up.

content:
I'm going to have to get a hearing aid soon. I can hear just fine in a relatively quiet room, but if other people are in the room talking, I can't sort anything out, even if the person who's talking to me is a couple feet away...as a result, I tend to avoid parties, restaurants, and I'm starting to isolate myself.

How did this happen? Two words: Loud. Music.

From my late teens to my late 30s, I had some serious badass stereo equipment. I'm not exaggerating in the least when I say my setup was powerful enough to easily host a block party, because I did it several times.

My motto was, "If it's too loud...You're too old!"

Now I'm just too old, my ears ring constantly, and it's fucking awful. Kids, DON'T crank it up.
