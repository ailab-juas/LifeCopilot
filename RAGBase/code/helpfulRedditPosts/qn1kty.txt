LPT: If you have a loved one that dies around you, do NOT try to go through their search history.

content:
For the love of God, do not go through someone's search history once they die. People seem to think going through their Google history will 'help them remember them', but its quite the contrary. What usually happens when going through somebody's history is that you get your memories of them tainted. Most people look up porn or other weird things and dont bother to hide it, so seeing it just taints your memories and makes you feel like they're a sex-craved deviant.
