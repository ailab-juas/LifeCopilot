YSK When people say "find a therapist", it can be really hard to find a good therapist, and bad therapists exist

 Why YSK: If you give the advice to "go see a therapist" and people take your advice, it might not be a helpful endeavor. And the reason it's not helping right away is sometimes that the therapy was wrong. It was not a failure of the individual.

While browsing online forums, I constantly see this phrase being given as advice: "consider going to see a therapist". There seems to be an increasing awareness and destigmatizing of mental health issues. And that's great.

What isn't brought up is the limits and failures of therapy.

In my personal experience, and through reading numerous online support groups, there are dozens of stories of a particular therapists or therapy approach not working for a given individual. And it feels like a very not talked about part of counseling as a health offering.

Finding a therapist can be hard. Similar to doctors, there are more competent and less competent individuals. There are specialists who may excel in one area but be clueless in another area. A lot of therapists tend to be arrogant. The power dynamic is scary - there is very little accountability, outside of professionalism, for a therapist making a client worse.

It saddens me, because I very much believe in the idea of mental health support. There are many stories of wonderful health outcomes. But there are also negative stories.

Finding an effective therapist can be really hard. It's an issue within the field. Part of it could be improved. And part of it is like dating - it helps to find someone you "click" with and it can be hard to predict that without trying a few people and risking some bad experiences. 

The challenges of seeking therapy are something more people could/should know.
