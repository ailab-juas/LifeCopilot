LPT: No matter how much you trust them or how close you are, never expect to get lent money back.

content:
If you wouldn't be totally fine without that money, dont lend them money. Most lent money doesnt get paid back, at least not in full. Some people are just users, but most people just dont realize how hard it is to save when you have no money whatsoever and still have tons of debt that needs paid.
