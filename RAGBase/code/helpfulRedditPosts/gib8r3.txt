title:
YSK that "what do you mean by that" is a good defense if you have the feeling someone is indirectly criticizing your behavior in a conversation

content:
It will bring them to specify their criticism. Sometimes it brings them to their borders as they realize they don't have any examples to bring up (which is needed in some forms of constructive criticism, not necessarily your SOs btw). Sometimes it will shut them up if they know a more direct criticism is not allowed or appropriate.

Many times, it will give you ground to react on or debunk the others critique. Be mindful though that, depending on your reaction, it can escalate an argument as well. It is recommended to hear the other person out and be mindful of what they have to say, IF they can really take a more direct approach to talk about problems with you.

Edit: This is gaining some traction, so I will add comments with good additions to this YSK

My favorite: u/meowhahaha: [Using "Help me understand" as a sign of cooperation instead of "you vs me"](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/gib8r3/ysk_that_what_do_you_mean_by_that_is_a_good/fqdxc3z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

u/DrSeafood: [Take note that you should not use this excessively - for example with your SO, friends, someone you look up to. Try to improve for some people without longing for examples.](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/gib8r3/ysk_that_what_do_you_mean_by_that_is_a_good/fqejlaf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

u/zen33824: [Using "Can you be more specific" as an alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/gib8r3/ysk_that_what_do_you_mean_by_that_is_a_good/fqdwksu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

u/LovesBlueSky: [Using "I'm not sure, what you mean by that" as an alternative way to phrase it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/gib8r3/ysk_that_what_do_you_mean_by_that_is_a_good/fqdnhd1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Edit 2: As this has been in question in the comments section, I'd like to emphasize this sentence in my original post:

***It is recommended to hear the other person out and be mindful of what they have to say, IF they can really take a more direct approach to talk about problems with you.***
