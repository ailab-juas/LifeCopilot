LPT: Greatly extend the life of your perishable vegetables and stop leaving them to rot

content:
With fresh vegetables, out of sight = out of mind = rotten vegetables thrown away. Instead of putting peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. in the vegetable bin at the bottom of your refrigerator, put them in the utility/butter bins in the fridge door. You'll see them every time you open the fridge and this will remind you to use them.

Put a folded piece of paper towel on the floor of the bin and put your cut onions, peppers, tomatoes, avocados, etc. face down directly on the paper towel--it will regulate the moisture of the veg without allowing them to be wet enough to rot. I don't change out the towel until it's gross, but do as you see fit. The vegetables simply do not spoil.

Put a folded piece of paper towel in the bag with any bagged veg such as baby carrots, shredded carrots, bagged salad, etc. Again, this will absorb water and eliminate condensate that promotes spoilage, while keeping them moist and fresh. This trick also works for mushrooms, strawberries, etc.--any produce that spoils in the presence of free water or that sweats liquid as it ages.
