LPT: if youre choking, dont go to the bathroom (or anyone) alone to deal with it. make AS MUCH commotion as possible.

*so i'm sure this obviously sounds like common sense but it definitely isn't in the moment.* 

i was at a restaurant (where i work actually) and eatting our staff meal at the end of the night. i put too much food in my mouth at once and when i swallowed the first chunk of meat it got stuck in my throat, blocking my air. i felt a combined feeling of not being able to breath and also like i was about to puke from my gag reflexes kicking in.

without even thinking i bee-lined it to the bathroom because i was trying not to make a big deal/draw attention to myself. basically i could take some short gasping breathes. i tried to make myself vomit and in the mean time i kept swallowing to try to get it to go down. eventually it did slide down my throat. the whole event was probably only three minutes long.

im feeling pretty shook up by it because i could have DIED alone in the bathroom. this is a thing that happens every year - people dying alone in bathrooms because they're too embarrassed to draw attention to themselves!!

*** if you're choking **IGNORE YOUR INSTINCTS!!** choking is a **SILENT DEATH** youre going to want to be in private incase you vomit/start retching/be gross in general etc. hit the table, hit people, knock glasses over, do **WHATEVER** you have to do to draw attention to yourself!!***

**edit:** allot of people are mentioning the international sign for [choking](http://67.media.tumblr.com/4c5b41f8c151e5ea63bcdc6ef8eb867b/tumblr_nwbyz8MbYq1qj1jrgo1_500.jpg) which everyone should know, of course. and if you are able to make that gesture in  your panic stricken state then that is the thing to do - for sure! i more so just wanted to bring to light an un-perfect choking scenario, other things that might happen, and just what to make sure you DO NOT do aka seek privacy. thanks everyone for the feedback and the stories! 
**edit2:** what i meant by "ignore your instinct" is ignore your flight instinct. if you take a CPR class they will tell you that most people are likely to run away to the bathroom or private location when they are choking.
