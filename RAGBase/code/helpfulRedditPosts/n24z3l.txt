YSK: Never kiss a baby or child's ear. It can cause damage and hearing loss.

content:
Why YSK:  "An innocent kiss right on the ear opening creates a strong suction that tugs on the delicate eardrum, resulting in a recently recognized condition known as "cochlear ear-kiss injury." Babies and small children are particularly vulnerable to hearing damage via a kiss, simply because their ear canals are smaller." 

***To clarify, even a firmly planted kiss without physically "sucking" can cause this.  It's similar to how plungers work.
