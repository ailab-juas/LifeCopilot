title:
YSK how to keep yourself safe from ads and sponsors

content:
In this day and age, there's no good reason that you should have to view digital advertisements. Why YSK: this guide will save you time by teaching you, if you don't know already, how to efficiently block ads.

Ads:

* Are annoying
* Take up unnecessary resources such as bandwidth (you can block well over 10,000,000 ads in a matter of maybe a couple years)
* Can be vectors for malicious software (malvertising)
* Are ways for large companies to convince you to buy something (generally subconsciously and generally something that you don't need)
* Waste your time

As an ancillary note, this guide will also help you avoid sponsored segments, which often advertise crappy, overpriced garbage (e.g. [Manscaped](https://np.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/l6d5ym/manscaped_baited_me/), [Raycons](https://np.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/mbuvhp/poor_raycon_earbud_sound_quality/)) and waste your time by forcing you to sit through them or manually scrub past.

Here's a simple, practical guide to avoiding both of them.

#Desktop

* uBlock Origin – a fast, efficient, feature-packed, and robust ad blocker 
 * [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
 * [Firefox Android](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ublock-origin/)
 * [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
 * [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak)
 * [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/)
 * (no longer compatible with Safari)

uBlock Origin is better than AdBlock Plus in essentially every conceivable way (faster, more feature-packed, cleaner UI, no whitelisted ads, etc.), which is why I'm not recommending ABP here. If you have ABP, I recommend switching to uBO.

* SponsorBlock – an extension that allows you to automatically (or manually) skip past sponsored sections; while disabled by default, you are also able to individually opt in to skipping outros, recaps, unpaid/self promotion, intros/intermissions, etc. You can create your own segments, which are voted on by the community through an upvote/downvote system. This will save you (it calculates how much time you've saved, and I've saved over 10.5 hours just by using it for a few months).

# Android

* [NewPipe x SponsorBlock](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/org.polymorphicshade.newpipe) (on F-Droid)
* [NewPipe vanilla](https://newpipe.net/)
* [YouTube Vanced](https://vancedapp.com/)

NewPipe is free and open-source software (FOSS), whereas Vanced is proprietary in some respects because it relies on a proprietary API. This means that you can, however, log into your account with Vanced.

#Other (DNS-wide)

* [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
 * [Setup tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4)

A DNS-wide ad blocker which can be installed on any Linux machine but which is designed to be used on low-power devices such as a Raspberry Pi. Blocks ads across your entire network.

#Edit:

For those concerned about iOS, that's why Pi-hole is there. :)
