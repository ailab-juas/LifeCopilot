YSK There is a baking hotline you can call if your recipe is going awry

content:
King Arthur Flour has a hotline you can call for baking advice. You call and a real person answers immediately (no touch tone menu). They are very friendly and helpful! 

I messed up my sourdough, called, and a very friendly woman helped me turn it into focaccia in real time.

855-371-BAKE
855-371-2253

Why YSK: It's coming up on the holidays, and this is a dinner-saver in a pinch!

Edit: US Only. And please don't prank them. They are so sweet and wholesome. Go buy their flour.
