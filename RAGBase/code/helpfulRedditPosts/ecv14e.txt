title:
LPT: most people don't feel strong cravings or a strong hangover after doing drugs a few times. Do not let this make you think you're immune to addiction. Don't let this encourage you to use more. It's a deadly trap. That's how it starts.

I'm 18 months clean from stimulants and I'll show you how addiction starts:

1- you overcome the initial fear and try drugs when someone offers you. You don't feel cravings after and you can't understand how some people do it 2-3 days in a row. Also, TV says it's highly addictive. But you feel no cravings and no strong hangover. You think TV is exaggerating or you must be immune or something.

2- Since everything went ok, you'll say yes the next time you're offered a fix. Again, you won't feel cravings after, or any strong hangover. The feeling that you're in control grows stronger.

3- the number of times you'll repeat step 2 to start having strong cravings and hangovers depends on the person. It can be 4 weeks or 4 months. That's when you start lying to yourself that you're under control.

4- drugs will lose their appeal, but it doesn't matter. you're hooked forever.
