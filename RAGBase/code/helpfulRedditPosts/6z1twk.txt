YSK: If you have a student account with Spotify, you now qualify for Hulu at no additional cost.

Somehow just found out, but this is a great deal. You can get Spotify premium and Hulu for the price of $4.99 a month if you're a college student with a valid email.

Edit: Applies to those in the U.S. only.
