LPT: If someone acts like they do not care about you, believe them.

content:
If you always get the feeling through subtle conversational cues or actions that a person just doesn't seem to care about you or anything you do, believe them. People that care about you will make you feel like it, will often even outright let you know. Don't throw it in the "it's me" column. There are people out there that will feel fortunate that you care as well. We live in a very passive, dismissive, and cold time. Do not put it on yourself. Be Safe.
