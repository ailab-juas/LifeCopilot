LPT: To calm a crying baby (who doesn't need to be fed or changed), FIRST make sure YOU are calm, your body and face are relaxed and soft. Be the antidote to their rigid anxiety - hold them in a way that they feel secure; bounce/sway while holding them; make eye contact, smile, and speak soothingly.

Even if you feel they don't understand your language, tell them soothing, supportive things like: "It's OK," "I'm here," "I know this is hard."

I learned this from my father who was a sort of baby whisperer and that's what my friends call me now. 

I got this by watching him and also being the recipient of this treatment, I remember crying because I was just anxious or bored and always wishing it would be my dad who came. Babies adored him, and kids flocked to him because he always had a relaxed demeanor with kids and communicated that he was interested in them and took them seriously.

As an aside, my father was a physician and people always asked why he never became a pediatrician because kids loved him and he loved them. He would always answer along the lines of, it's because he loved them that he couldn't do it, to be a pediatrician means you have to hurt the kids and that's very hard when you empathize with them so much.

Your heart may be full of empathic stress for the little one, but don't show it in your body language or facial expression, they know.

ETA: This is really just advice for a baby in existential distress, not biological of any kind, including being sick or injured. Though soothing is often helpful even in these cases as well, it shouldn't always be the only way you address their issues.
