YSK to always send that message of concern to a loved one.

content:
Why YSK: It may seem over reaching, unnecessary, but many lives have been saved by “unnecessary” concern. I know of three myself. One of which being me. 

One friend (from another state) called out of the blue a few months ago and mentioned concern for me, and to vent or text whenever I needed. 

At the time it may seem trivial, obligatory, or unnecessary… but it hurts you none to say those words, however may save a life. 

Tonight I was about 50% through “the process” and remembered what my buddy had said. When I felt no one was there, I remembered that one sentence. 

That “obligatory and unnecessary” concern is why I am typing this post right now. 

Show concern for loved ones. even if you feel silly or out of line for doing so… you don’t know who’s listening for whatever reasons.


Edit: Yes, even your ex. You were with them at one point for a reason, try to see that side and please don’t wish them harm.
