YSK: Bungee cords are the leading cause of serious eye injuries

content:
Why YSK: When a bungee cord snaps back, it can travel at more than 200 miles an hour. This can cause serious damage to your eye and lead to vision loss or blindness. 

Instead of using bungee cord to tie down loads in a vehicle, use rope or ratcheting straps. It could save you from a devastating injury.
