YSK: how to get a public WiFi login page to appear

content:
If you’re connecting to a public WiFi network, and can’t get the generic “click here to connect” page to pop up, open a browser (in incognito/private mode seems to help) and access routerlogin.net. This is normally the page one uses to access one’s home router, but 95% of the time in my experience, it automatically redirects to the pesky connect page at Starbucks, the library, Panera, etc. if you can’t get it to pop up on its own.
