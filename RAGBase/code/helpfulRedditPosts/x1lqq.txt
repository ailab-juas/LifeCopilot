I have been seeing a lot of I'm about to be homeless threads in various subreddits so here's a long how to

**Ok so this got to the front page and I'd like it to do some good**

Here is where you can find a local shelter to donate supplies to.

http://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/

Please if you can do it, if you can't and you have time volunteer with Food Not Bombs or start your own group.

At the very least if you see somebody asking for change and you have leftovers in your hand, feed a hungry mouth for the night.

This is by no means the only way to go about this. This is just how I found the easiest way to do it. If you have questions post them and I'll try to get to them tomorrow because well I have homework to do. Also this is from when I was homeless and traveling so if you have any questions about that that's fine. Feel free to repost this to a more appropriate subreddit if you think there is one. Just include the information at the bottom please. Also this guide might only work in the U.S. or similar places with a similar or better welfare structure.

Also including a link to the recent IAMA that sparked this now I know this person posted in the wrong forum but if they can provide some key information maybe we can get them in contact with somebody that can help? I've already reposted their IAMA to /r/assistance http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/x1et3/iamabout_to_be_homeless_im_going_to_ask_to_be/

Alright so here's a bit more about what this is. This is not how to be homeless, it's not how to travel, it's not how to beat the system. This is last case scenario advice for somebody with no safety net who has just been kicked out of the house. This advice should help you to get back on your feet using the shelter system in America. This is by no means how most homeless live. Most homeless are under a bridge, or in a covered cause way. They are forced to sleep on cardboard pallets in abandoned buildings. This is fancy living compared to how most homeless have to/ forced to/ choose to live. Homelessness is a very complex issue and encompasses a very diverse group of people.

During your eviction hold a "fire sale", that is sell everything you own that is not


3 pairs of pants


3 shirts


7 pairs underwear

All of your socks

A blanket or sleeping bag

A backpack to put all of this in

After you have sold all of this stuff for whatever it will go for sight unseen, go to the bank that has your account and do one of two things. If you do not have a negative balance you should deposit all of the money you just made. If you do have a negative balance you should withdraw all of the funds that they will allow you to.

Now go to a different bank and open up an account, but do not get an atm card. This will require you to go to the bank to withdraw money. It will also make it easier to deposit money than to withdraw it.

Now take your backpack and go to the nearest mission, you want to do this pretty early in the afternoon or sooner if you can. Ask the person at the front desk if you can be processed for intake. If they say no tell them you are homeless and ask for the address of the nearest shelter that is taking in people. If they say you're too early ask for when intake is and be there a half hour early, this is because beds go fast. The reason beds go fast is because here you'll get a shower, a bed and a hot meal.
Now that you're in the shelter you must do this one thing. Treat everybody there as a human, you'll be rooming with some pretty sad sorts, and you are no better than they are. The reason they are there is the same reason you are there, it beats the hell out of cold concrete. I can attest to the frigidity of concrete and it'll humble a soul.

Now that you have a bed you need to ask where you can safely store your belongings, this is very important because now you are going to realize the importance of everything you own. Also theft is pretty much the worst thing that could happen to you right now so guard against it.

You'll probably have to go to some church service before dinner. Suck it up and do it, this is your rent that you pay. Close your eyes and think about Half Life 3 finally coming out, or replay all of the greatest things that you've ever done with a girl. Do anything you can that will prevent you from falling asleep and making the pastor/preacher/reverend from having an excuse to kick you out. Also you don't want to insult somebody that has agreed to feed you.

Ok so now it's chow time, eat up. But don't take seconds. I know you're hungry but see that old toothless bastard over there, he's been doing this all his life. You're only going to be here for a week or two max.
Now it's shower time. This is probably going to suck unless you played sports in highschool or showered after gym. You'll be showering with your own gender. This is only as awkward as you make it. But just keep in mind somebody is going to see you naked. After the shower you may be offered socks. Take them! You may even be offered a laundry service. You need to figure out how this is run and who runs it. Get in good with this person so that you can get all of your clothes back when they've laundered them for you. This is important, because now socks are your best friend.

Ok so now you're going to bed and you've been told the rules, lights out after such and such time. Breakfast at such and such time.

You're going to wake up earlier than you usually do. Don't gripe. Make your bed. Go eat. Now go up front and see if you can get an I.D. card or inquire about how to save your bed for the night. You'll probably have to do some chore or such. Do them, remember bed &gt; concrete.

Now that it's morning and you've done your chores. You're going to feel pretty childish. Well it is. Don't get used to it. You should now go out and look for employ. I used to hold a sign near Home Depot or Lowes saying Will Work For Peanuts with a little elephant on it. It worked and I learned many a trade. Usually through this I would befriend somebody who's couch I could sleep on. I did this while I was traveling. 

When I stopped traveling I ended up being roomates with a guy on the job site and we have been great friends ever since. Even though I now live in Chicago and he in Escondido we still talk on the phone.
Until somebody offers you a couch, you need to rinse and repeat this day until you get a couch. Once you get a couch you have access to laundry and hopefully respectable clothes. If you have gotten on in a job site you might even have learned a trade much as I did. If not well apply to any local coffee shop or small business that gives interviews. Tell the interviewer what you've just been through. People will generally hire you on at a low wage and train you because you're showing more initiative than most candidates. Also many people want to help. More people want to help you than you'll ever know. Cherish this fact and pay it forward. It'll reward you more than anything.

I was homeless and traveling from age 18 to 23. I'm now 27 and going to school under the Pell Grant for Computer Science and have enough knowledge to build my own house. I wouldn't have any of this knowledge if I was not in your position when I was younger. I regret not going to college sooner but everybody has their cross to bear.

Other tips that I forgot and were provided by people below are these.


From [CXR1037](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihh7r) Look up a food not bombs feeding in your area it's a great place to get lunch and meet people who might let you crash or might have a line on a job. 

From [fearthespoon](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ih1io) Good resource on sleeping in a car as a shelter. I was never lucky enough to have a car but it's a good point nonetheless. 



From [00fordmc](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihu9n) It is definitely important to be aware of your surroundings and know that not every one of your peers wants to give you a hand up.



From [flooing](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ii2gj) If you are a guest in somebody's home you are a fucking guest. Do the dishes, make your bedding invisible, be up before they are with coffee and breakfast. Also learn to dumpster so you can contribute food to the house without using precious money

From [superconfused](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihxld) Stay clean and approachable, you'll get much better reactions because believe it or not appearance matters.

From [surejohn](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ih85v) Also it's suggested to bring a towel.

From [Hr_is_your_friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/x1et3/iamabout_to_be_homeless_im_going_to_ask_to_be/c5ig0nj)
 If you don't like the Jesus stuff you might luck out over on /r/AtheistHavens 

From [Watersinks](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihxej)
 pack technical underwear if you can get it, it's fast drying and stinks less.

**TL:DR Do what migrant workers do, sleep at a shelter and work for cheap and you'll end up just fine. The American Dream is true if you have drive.**

Aw cripes guys the front page really?! You're too kind to this crusty old bum.
