LPT: If you quit watching the 24-hour news-cycle, life is happier.

content:
The news is designed to alarm and outrage you. There's not much you can do about it anyhow. The news-cyclers produce a false picture of life by accentuating the negative events.

An informed electorate is essential, but a short weekly perusing of the major headlines, with any additional web search for points of interest or depth is plenty enough to keep informed. Balance it out by seeking the positive acts of human beings. You'll be a lot happier, and see that humans are wonderful creatures.
