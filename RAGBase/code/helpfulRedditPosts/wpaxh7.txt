LPT: if you have a difficult phone call to make, turn the volume down on the receiver.

I spent 10 years of my life in sales, and most of that involved a lot of phone calls. 

As with all forms of sales, some of the phone calls we had to make were to deliver some difficult news. 

If you aren’t looking forward to breaking some news to someone over the telephone, lower the volume of their voice and suddenly they’ll sound far less threatening, thus giving you much more confidence in a difficult situation.
