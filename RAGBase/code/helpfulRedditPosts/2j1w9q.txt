YSK when to use "Mary and I" and when to use "Mary and me"

content:
You should use  *Mary and I* when you are the **subject** of a sentence. 

&gt; Mary and I went to the market

and *Mary and me* when you are the **object**

&gt; He gave Mary and me free tickets to his show

A quick way to check is to replace *Mary and I* or *Mary and me* with just *I* or *me* respectively, and see if it sounds right.


So 
&gt; (Mary and) I went to the market

**not**

&gt; (Mary and) me went to the market

and

&gt; He gave (Mary and) me free tickets to his show

**not**

&gt; He gave (Mary and) I free tickets to his show
