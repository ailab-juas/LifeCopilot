LPT: don't try to turn all your hobbies into business oportunities

content:
I wish I knew this sooner, but I got tired of so many things I used to love doing because I tried making money with them. Sometimes I was successful, but most of the times it ruined it for me. 

I now try to separate what I love doing from what I'm good at (which is a good business path) and am happier than before. Once I started to recognize this,  I started seeing the same in al successful people I know.
