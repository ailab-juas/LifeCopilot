title:
LPT: never answer a phone call or text message from your boss on your day off unless you want to go into work

content:
Much like you should never talk with law enforcement without a lawyer present you should never acknowledge your boss on one of your days off unless you are an on-call employee that day.  I can tell you from experience it will never end well telling your boss that you won't come in on your day off. I go way above and beyond my job detail when I'm at work because that's just the kind of person I am. I'm always willing to help with whatever is necessary to make the job run smoothly when I am on the clock, but on my days off not a chance.
