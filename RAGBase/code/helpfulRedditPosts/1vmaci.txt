title:
YSK how to use pronouns when speaking or writing in English

content:
It's not complicated. For example, let's say someone says, "Could you draw a picture of my cat and I?" The way you know if "I" is the correct pronoun in this case: simply break the sentence in two. (1) "Could you draw a picture of my cat?" Correct! (2) "Could you draw a picture of I?" Incorrect! 

So in this case, change "I" to "me," and you have (2) "Could you draw a picture of me?" Morphing the two correct sentences back together, you have, "Could you draw a picture of my cat and me?" (I would bother you with objects and subjects, but all you really have to know is if it sounds right.)

One more: would you ever say, "Her went to the grocery store"? I sure hope not. You'd say, "She went to the grocery store," right? So you would never say, "Her and I went to the grocery store." You would say, "She and I went to the grocery store."

If you speak incorrectly because all your friends do and you don't want to sound too smart, it's time to give that up. There's nothing wrong with understanding how to use the English language.
