LPT: have a baby and hate losing sleep when you get up? Use a red light bulb!

content:
I hate getting up in the middle of the night to turn on a light, my eyes adjusting to it and then my brain telling me Iâ€™m awake and now Im unable to go back to sleep myself. Have a lamp in the bedroom that you can turn on that has a red light bulb. It prevents waking up your partner when you get up and allows you to go back to sleep after taking care of your child. They are used commonly on submarines to prevent waking up everyone in close quarters.
