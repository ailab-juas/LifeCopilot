YSK That your Android phone can act as wifi receptor for your desktop/laptop

content:
Although a very niche YSK, this has helped me with problems before.

With a USB cord plug your phone to your computer. In phone settings under Wireless and Networks, click more, Tethering, then USB tethering. And follow the phone from there!

Even though WiFi modules are extremely common shit happens! This method allows you to use WiFi whereas hotspot forces you to use data.
