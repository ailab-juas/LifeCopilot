LPT: Don’t put yourself down in order to compliment someone, ESPECIALLY children

content:
I work in a school and often hear adults say things like “wow, you’re such a good artist! I can’t draw anywhere near that well” or “you’re so good at math, I could never do my times tables that fast.” Using phrasing like that teaches kids (or anyone) that 1) all talent is competitive- how good you are at something is defined by how much better you are than others and 2) that their success makes others feel bad about themselves, and by extension they should feel bad about others’ success.

Instead, model positive effort-based comments, like  “wow you’re so good at art! I hope I can be that good someday if I keep practicing!” Or non-comparative positive statements, like “wow you’re so good at art! Its so fun to use your imagination to make something new.” You can also never go wrong by praising effort over talent, as in “you’re so good at math! You must study very hard.”

Same goes for talking to adults (although the imagination comment might be a little cheesy so you’d want to reword).
