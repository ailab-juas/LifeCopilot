YSK Google Play Books allows a very generous sample of books to be downloaded for free

This is obviously handy for all books to get a feel for if you would like it, but extends to cookbooks, how to books, everything. Pictures included. So if you want to learn a little about a topic, it's a great way to read the intro pages at the very least and then buy the full version of your favourite pick. You come away with knowledge and are still supporting the author (at least one anyway).

I've seen 30, to 60 pages free in the few I've used so far. I'm assuming it's a set percentage of the amount of pages in the book but may not be necessarily. Free book samples may not be a surprise to most people, but I think a lot of people would be surprised at how generous they are

EDIT: Oook, we can drop the sarcasm guys. There are plenty of people who don't want to pirate books. I'm well aware there are methods of doing so. This ain't one. I may be cheap, but I don't feel great about ripping off people's hard work in full. A free sample is a nice balance. 

I don't go to libraries for books for personal preference, and I'm sure plenty of people are the same. I also know free samples is no revolutionary idea, but I decided to post this after mentioning it to my boyfriend (who has probably never downloaded a book in his life), and he was surprised at the AMOUNT of free pages in a sample which is what I'm getting at here.
