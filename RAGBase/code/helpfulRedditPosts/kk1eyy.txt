LPT: Get pet insurance. I had a $3k bill for my cat's overnight vet stay a few years ago. Now, I just pay $25 a month and they cover $5k in injury/illness expenses a month

content:
There are plenty of providers out there, and they can also offer preventative care insurance. I personally go through ASPCA, but shop around. It could save you a lot of grief in the long term, and can save your animal too. 

I especially recommend this for people who couldn't handle an overnight $3k vet bill. Budget out the $25 a month instead because, at some point, you'll need it, and you never want to be in the position of picking between your wallet and your pet.

Edit: $5k in illness/injury a year. Sorry for any confusion on that front.

Edit 2: To address all the naysayers who say "just save up instead". I think it's better to say that if/when you have the savings to handle $5-15k in pet expenses, you can go without insurance or cancel. Until then, it's better to carry it, at least to me. There are plenty of examples in the comments of pets getting hurt in the first year and insurance coming in for the save.

Everyone should obviously analyze their own situation. The "just save up instead" attitude falls on its face if your pet gets hurt or sick in the first 5 years of the "save up" approach and those savings aren't enough to cover it.

Edit 3: Lots of love to Healthy Paws insurance from people in the comments. I'll probably switch to them in the new year based on people's experiences here.
