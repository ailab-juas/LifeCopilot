LPT: In a major city and can't find a business that will let you use their bathroom? Here's how to gain access to any bathroom you want.

So I'm from a small city and was pretty taken aback the first time I traveled to Boston and kept getting turned away from restaurant bathrooms when I desperately needed to pee. If you're in a place that's unfamiliar and you keep getting the customers only/employees only line try this out. Instead of just asking can I use your bathroom, very politely say to the employee, "Hey there, I work over at (name of business next door that doesn't have uniforms), and our bathrooms out of order. Would you mind if I used yours real quick?" It has worked for me 100% of the time even at places where the bathroom is employees only. Good luck.
