LPT: Loyalty to an employer will rarely get you the salary you think you’re worth. It’s better to shop yourself to the highest bidder until you’re satisfied with your pay.

5 years ago I left the military and started a job at a biomedical technology company. I made a friend there who had been there a year longer than me and we were making about the same salary. Since then I’ve worked at 2 other companies before finally landing at a AAA tech company that feels like a real career. He stayed at the smaller biomedical company. I currently make $13 more an hour than he does with far better benefits because I didn’t settle. I recently offered to help him get a job at my company and once he got the job offer he turned it down because he believes they’ll eventually promote him. This is the lie that companies depend on their employees believing. The 1-4% annual raises are the carrot on a stick that keep you running on the wheel. Don’t be afraid of change. If you know your worth, never settle.
