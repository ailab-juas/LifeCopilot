LPT: Switch your shifters to the lowest setting on a bicycle before leaving it nearby.

content:
About a year ago I suggested this to a friend of mine and today his bike was attempted to be stolen by a woman in her late 30’s. This was at a local cafe (some shops are beginning to open again) and there didn’t seem to be any bike racks nearby and he left it close to the door near him, somewhere where he could see it easily. Out of the corner of his eye while about to order he saw a women approaching his bike suspiciously and begun to hop on it. To her surprise, the shifters were on the lowest setting and she fell flat on her face after the first push of the pedals. My friend prob would’ve lost his bike that day if the gears weren’t on the lowest setting.
