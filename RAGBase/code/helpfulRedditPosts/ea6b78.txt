LPT: If you feel that a conflict is emerging, seize any opportunity to change the form of communication (e.g. switch from e-mail to a phone call)

content:
Many conflicts can be nipped in the bud by changing the form of communication. The most obvious example is switching from written communication to paying a visit (or calling on the phone), or the other way around: leaving a conversation that doesn't lead anywhere and instead write a text message or an e-mail where you explain your position.

1. The pause gives you (and the counterpart) a chance to calm down, in case either of you is worked up.
2. It might give you a new approach to whatever the difference of opinion is about, since the new form of communication demands that you rethink it.
3. When writing emails/texting, many people accidentally come across as either blunt or sarcastic (especially if there's a difference of opinion going on). If that's how you interpret the other person, speaking to them might dispel your concerns.

EDIT: I want to point out that the LPT is for **keeping** a discussion, misunderstanding or difference of opinion **from turning into a conflict**. 

For handling full on conflicts, where your primary concern is for instance keeping your job or preparing for a legal process, the LPT might not be ideal. Lots of people are pointing out the need to have an ongoing conflict on record, by e-mailing instead of calling. I'm not going to disagree.
