LPT: Add a manual autocorrect entry to your phone, which replaces ‘@@‘ with your full email address. Never type it out again!

content:
Do ignore this if you have autofill for browsers/apps, password manager and/or predictive text. If your phone already does this, you’ve almost certainly got one of the aforementioned active, and can ignore this tip. I don’t use either, but do have autocorrect on, which this tip exploits 🤟🏼
