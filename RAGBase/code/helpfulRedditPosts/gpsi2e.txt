LPT when you’re offered to taste the wine in a restaurant, unless it has a cork, you don’t need to bother

content:
A common misconception is that when the waiter asks “would sir/madam like to taste?” When they bring a bottle of wine, that the customer is deciding on if they like the taste or not - which is wrong. Doesn’t matter if you like it or not, once it’s opened it’s yours.


The reason why you taste is to see if it has been corked or not. 

Corked wine is where the natural cork used in wine(very uncommon these days) has been contaminated with bacteria before stopping the wine. This can contaminate the wine by giving it a mouldy or damp flavour. Or in some cases introduce too much oxygen or not allow for a proper seal of the bottle, allowing the alcohol to evaporate, giving a flat and “old” flavour to the wine.


So if you were to order an expensive vintage wine, the chances that the cork could have perished over time increases, so you taste a small amount to inspect the flavour and taste to make sure it’s not “off”. A common technique is to offer the cork to the customer as well to inspect.


If your waiter offers to let you “taste” your wine and it has a screw cap or synthetic cork, they’re doing it for a show or spectacle and in some cases might be doing it to have a laugh at you. 


I worked in the restaurant industry for almost 15 years now and see it a lot with inexperienced diners and inexperienced waiters thinking it’s just a thing you do.
