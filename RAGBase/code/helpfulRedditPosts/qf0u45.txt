title:
LPT: If you’re working towards a goal, don’t tell anybody about it until you’ve actually accomplished it!

content:
Otherwise, you get the dopamine hit of telling other people your plans without actually having to do the work.

edit: I realize that this may not be the most effective method for everyone. 

I have found myself following through on goals much more easily since keeping them to myself until completed. I believe it’s due to the reward system benefit^ as well as really deciding to make a change for myself and deciding that I can do it without other people’s validation. Could be just me though.
