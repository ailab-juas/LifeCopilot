YSK that during the current world climate, many companies are delaying bill payments, however, your bill is STILL ACCUMULATING!

content:
Many companies such as T-Mobile and Spectrum are working with customers to extend their bill by 60 days. However your bill will still accumulate and not suspend. There are many companies that are not telling people this so I felt I should let people know who need to go this route(such as myself). Consider trying to pay down your bills during your grace period or expect massive sized bills to hit you once we are past all this.
