LPT: If you don't feel motivated to tackle a task directly, instead do easy work that will make the task easier when you do start it.

I'm sure many of you out there, like me, struggle to get the motivation for jobs/study/cleaning tasks.

I have always found that it's much easier to actually pick up a job and start it if you have done some work that makes that job easier when you do start it. These tasks are usually low-hanging fruit, like just getting materials organised, cleaning, easy preparation.

For example, painting a room. It often takes a lot of preparation and planning just to paint a room, and you can make it much easier to start the job by just finding the things you may need and putting them together, so when the day comes to start painting, you don't waste time looking for everything. It's a lot easier to start a major job when you know that you have already made it easier for yourself.

Do you have any examples?
