YSK about the digital signature import tool built into OSX's "Preview" software. Just hold up your signature on a piece of paper to the camera and it will vectorise it for you, ready to be imported into your documents or emails.

A little known gem of software engineering. Very quick, very clever... and it actually works well.

If you own a Mac, open up a document in Preview. Then press the little briefcase button on the top next to the search bar. Press the "signature" button and you can select to either "write" it on a trackpad or use the camera. Select the camera option.

Write your signature on a piece of paper and hold it up to the camera. VOILA! A vectorised version of your signature ready to import!
