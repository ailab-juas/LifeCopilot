LPT: If you want to sell your car, you increase your car’s value by about $1000 by having it thoroughly cleaned. Take it to a beautiful background to take pictures to put in your ad. Meet at DMV so you can transfer title and swap for cash while surrounded by Sheriffs. (No Cashiers Checks)

I just recovered my car from my son’s house that had been parked under an oak tree for about six months. It was filthy! I shampooed carpets and seats, replaced air filter‘s, washed the car by hand three times.  I also had a pre-sale inspection from the oil change place, and the CarFax for the vehicle. I listed it at Max value private sale Kelly blue book.  I had three inquiries in an hour.  Three hours after I placed the ad, the title was transferred to the new owner. (Never accept cashiers checks, because they are frequently faked.)
