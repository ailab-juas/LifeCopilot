YSK when giving your young children presents this year it is often a good idea to have the modest gifts be from Santa and the more expensive gifts from the parent

content:
Most schools have kids whose parents can't give them the Christmas they want. So when your kid goes to school and tells his friends about the game console they opened that was directly  "From Santa", they may inadvertently upset a less fortunate child who Santa was only able to bring a new backpack. Besides, it totally gives you bragging rights to your kids when the best gifts are labeled as being from you.
