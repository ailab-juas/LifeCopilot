title:
YSK to NEVER hang up on an accidental 911 (or police, ambulance, fire station)

content:
If you do accidentally call one and hang up, police will be sent to your house, they don't know if you're potentially being held hostage and were forced to hang up or what-not. Just say something along the lines of, "I'm so sorry, I accidentally called". Hope this helps in that awkward situation. ( Don't know if this has been posted here, sorry if it has)
