LPT: Buying something small on Amazon and don't qualify for free Super Saver Shipping?  Add some household items that you always need like paper towels or toilet paper to your cart (cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart) and get your entire order shipped for free.

It annoys me that I have to spend $25 to get free super saver shipping from Amazon when I'm just ordering something small like a CD or DVD.  Instead of wasting more money on buying something else I don't need, I just purchase items that I always need around the house that will push my order over the qualifying amount for super saver shipping.
