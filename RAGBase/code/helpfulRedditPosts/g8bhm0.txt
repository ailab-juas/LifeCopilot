LPT: If you're posting a long story anywhere, please use paragraphs. Some people are incredibly discouraged by unseparated walls of text, and your otherwise interesting story might go unnoticed because of it.

content:
I've seen a lot of posts in r/tifu and r/maliciouscompliance that were both really long, and just one massive block of text. I personally have a hard time not getting lost in text when it isn't spaced out every now and then, to the point where I don't even try to read it when I see posts like that. 

I'm sure your post is great and interesting, but I would bet that I'm not the only one turned away by massive text walls.

Edit: My first front-page post is me being a grammar nazi. Great.

In all seriousness, thanks for the awards and stuff! &lt;3

Edit 2: For some reason this hit #1 on the front page. I love you guys &lt;3

Final Edit: (this one's actually relevant) apparently, you have to hit enter twice for the paragraph to separate properly. Hopefully this helps!
