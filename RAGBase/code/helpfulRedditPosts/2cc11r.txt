LPT- Pay yourself first

content:
With alot of people struggling with debt and just outright living beyond their means, alot of people have little to no savings.  This is aimed aT a person just starting their first job right up through retirement.  

This is how it works. Say you start off and you get a job paying you $100/wk.  Take $10 of that and put it in an account that isn't tied to a debit card, cannot be accessed online and does not allow cheques to be written on it.  As you progress through your career the first thing you do on payday is take 10% of your paycheck and move it into that account.  Keep doing that every payday throughout your life and you'll have quite a sizeable nest egg at the end.  It's difficult to get into the habit but once it's established you'll be able to do it without even noticing.

TL;DR Save what you can but take care of debt first or don't save..whichever you prefer.
