LPT Organize your clothes based on what activity you're doing, not by type of clothing...

e.g. one drawer for casual wear, one drawer for workout clothes, one drawer or section of the closet for going out clothes, and one for work clothes. This makes your outfit options readily available and saves time when selecting clothing every day, which is usually based on activity.
