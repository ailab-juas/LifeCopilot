LPT: You are not responsible for other people's self-esteem and you are responsible for your own self-esteem.

content:
Confident people will not care if you think their laugh is funny.   
Confident people will not care that you mentionned your high salary while they make less.   
Confident people will not care that you have a lot of sex and they don't.   
Confident people will not care that you made fun of something they love.  
Confident people will not care that you dislike what they like.

And you shouldn't care either when the roles are reversed. Stop expecting everyone to be careful around you and stop trying to be a perfect person that never has a faux-pas during a conversation. Socializing is a lot of give and take, along with understanding that sometimes people say dumb shit.

One exception: If you are a parent, you *definitely* are responsible for building up your child's self esteem. Please be mindful.
