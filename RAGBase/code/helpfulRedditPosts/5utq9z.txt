LPT: Clean one room a day. It breaks down the chore and means you don't have to dedicate a significant part of your weekend or evening to keep your house clean.

[Inspired by this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2meirl4meirl/comments/5us6uc/2meirl4meirl/?st=izbjitmz&amp;sh=321a3983). I had an ex who insisted that Saturday should be cleaning day of the whole house, no matter what. Way to wipe out the best part of the weekend. :-/

After leaving her, I discovered that it was far less of a drain to just do one (or two) rooms per day. I get in from work, get changed, and clean a room. Takes 20 minutes. The rest of my time is my own, and my house is clean.
