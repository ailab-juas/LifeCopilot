LPT: make banking and other document record keeping easy by downloading all previous years statements at the beginning of the year.

content:
While I know that ill probably never-ever look at my checking statements in the future, I also know that keeping good records is important. I hate filing papers though, and its a pain to try and keep track of every statement. So every year in January, I log onto all my accounts that have something important that should be filed (banking, investments, insurance, etc) and download all the previous years paperwork in PDF then save it to a folder (i.e.: Records&gt;Checking&gt;2013&gt;2013 Statements)

Easy! Takes maybe an hour once a year and might make all the difference in the world if you ever need those records in the future. Or you'll never look at them again, but it only takes a few MB of space rather than boxes of old papers.
