LPT: Buying a luxury car isn't the expensive part, maintaining it is.

content:
I worked in the auto industry for several years and this is something I feel is important for people to know.  Everyone wants a luxury car and buying them used isn't usually too bad, but when they break and it comes time to fix it; what would normally cost $200 on a Honda is $1,200 on a BMW.

Be mindful of the repair costs on a car before you buy them.
