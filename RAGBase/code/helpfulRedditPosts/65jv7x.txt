LPT: Carry your wallet in your front pocket

content:
Less likely to lose it with it falling out, less prone to pick pockets and probably most important you don't have to shift your hips when you sit down to accommodate for your wallet. Been doing it for years ever since I lost my wallet when it fell out of my back pocket once.
