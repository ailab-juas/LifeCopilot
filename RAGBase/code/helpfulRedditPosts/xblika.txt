LPT: If you are moving in with your partner, don't move into their place, get a new place together

content:
If you move into their place there is a high probability that you will feel like you are living in their house, not yours, and you will likely struggle to create space for yourself or have much agency when you disagree on something.   Even if you discuss how to work things out, the defacto position will always favor the way they already live and their "house rules" and you will have to adjust to that.

Remember that when you're moving in you're always optimistic about things, but the reality will usually not meet your optimism.

If you get a new place together you will have a chance to discuss what you really want, and address subjects that may feel taboo when you're moving into their space and it will really feel like you have a right to make household decisions
