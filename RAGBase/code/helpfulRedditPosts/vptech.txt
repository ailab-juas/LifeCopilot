LPT: If your car overheats when you're not near service, turn the heat on high to cool it down.

This will actually cool things down under the hood. Open the windows, point the vents outward and keep driving. EDIT: Keep driving to the nearest service area! This happened to me in 'the hill towns' near my small city. It's a last resort.
