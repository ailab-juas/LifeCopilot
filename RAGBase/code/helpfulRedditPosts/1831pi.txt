LPT: 4 Simple ways to identify a potential stroke victim. This could help save someones life.

content:
Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. The stroke victim may suffer *severe brain damage* when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.

Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three [edit] four simple questions:


1. Ask the individual to **SMILE**

2. Ask the person to TALK and **SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE** (Coherently)

3. Ask him or her to **RAISE BOTH ARMS**

4. **Stick out Your Tongue**

Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his tongue. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke.

If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.

[edit]
