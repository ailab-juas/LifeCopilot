LPT: When a pet has a mid to late-stage terminal illness, don't go through brutal and extraordinary measures to extend it's life too long. Especially cats. They cannot tell you they are suffering. Yes, we want more time with them. But not if they are hurting.

Our 2 senior cats died a few months apart during the quarantine.  The 1st had cancer.  And we extended his life by 1 year through chemo and monthly vet visits.  This included an endoscopy, and being poked and prodded by needles every few weeks.  He was skinny, vomited often, and had no energy.  But we thought it was okay because his loving personality was still there.  He died gasping, not being able to breathe.  **Immediate** regrets.

Our 2nd cat had kidney failure.  Daily IV fluids at home, pills twice per day.  Became super skinny.  She developed pancreatitis which is apparently (to humans) so painful that people are hospitalised as the only treatment.  We did not know until it became very obvious.  Ran her to the vet.  Figured she'd be back in a week and we can keep giving her IV's to extend her life at home.

She died gasping at the vet.  We made it just in time to say goodbye (vet called, drove there at 4am, held her as she passed).

It took 2 lessons, but now I know that **extending a pet's life by extraordinary means is selfish on our part, when they have a mid to late stage terminal illness**.  We just want more time with them.  But we may be causing them pain without realizing it.  

If I could go back in time, I would have called the vet to our home so our cats could pass peacefully here, with no pain, and no fear.  Their lives would have been slightly shorter by a few months.  But if I have to suffer pain and invasive medical procedures for the last year of my life...  I would rather not live that year.
