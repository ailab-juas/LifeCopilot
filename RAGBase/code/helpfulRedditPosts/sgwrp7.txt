title:
LPT: don't share photos or videos while out on vacation.

content:
I know it's tempting but it just dawned on me right after I posted a photo with the caption: "on a well needed 3 week vacation"

I quickly took the photo down realizing how I was pretty much setting myself up to get robbed while being hundreads of miles away.

I know some of us really want to share the views and experiences while on vacation but it's best to just post those photos/videos after you're back home.
