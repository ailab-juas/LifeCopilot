LPT Save money on eBay by searching for misspelled goods

content:
Often a seller isn't diligent in checking their ad is correctly spelled and this leads to auctions that have few bidders.

An example is "Mountain Bike" misspelled as "Mountin" or "Montian Bike."

"Jewellery" is also commonly misspelled. Commonly you can be the only bidder on an auction simply because no one else has seen it.
