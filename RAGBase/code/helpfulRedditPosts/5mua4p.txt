LPT: If you are considering signing up for a class or private instruction (yoga, instrument, etc.) check out your local community college first!

content:
I just signed up for two 5 month courses at my local cc for under $200 total! One being yoga and the other being Jazz piano. The piano class is an hour of private instruction once a week and the yoga is two hour classes each week. This option could save you hundreds of dollars each month! 

Edit: Thanks for my first gold lovely stranger!
