LPT: As a DIYer, when you’re at the home center if the older employee asks if they can help you, say yes if you have a moment even if you know what you’re doing.

Many times these people were in the trade for the section they’re now working in. Tell them what you’re working on and the approach you’re taking. Sometimes they’ll offer ideas and tips you didn’t think of that makes the job easier. Sometimes they’ll just agree that you’re doing the right thing. 

But no matter what, you gave them an opportunity to share their knowledge in a world where people know it all from YouTube and don’t take time to talk to people in person.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards and all the kind words behind the intent of this post.
