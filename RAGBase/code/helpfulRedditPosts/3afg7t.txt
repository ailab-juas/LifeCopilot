title:
YSK that if you ever have to administer an EpiPen to someone experiencing anaphylaxis, you still need to call an ambulance immediately for further treatment.

content:
EpiPen injections are rapid but their effects are short-lived. Even if the person in anaphylaxis seems to respond positively to the EpiPen, they are at risk for a further reaction once the injection wears off. 

You also need to inform emergency personnel need to be informed that an EpiPen was administered so that they can provide appropriate treatment.
