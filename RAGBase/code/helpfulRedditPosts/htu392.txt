LPT: If you're staying at a hotel &amp; you get a call from the front desk asking for your card information; hang up the phone &amp; walk to the lobby to handle it in person. The phone call may be a scam.

I got a call early in the morning saying it was the front desk and my card didnt process payment. So I told them I'd look for my card and call back, they tried keeping me from hanging up but I was half asleep so I wasn't trynna listen, so I hung up. Went downstairs to handle the payment in which they told me they never called and all my card info was correct. They acknowledged it wasn't them and probably was a scam, but also said it was their first time hearing about this scam. 

TLDR: Got a call from a scammer pretending to be hotel front desk.
