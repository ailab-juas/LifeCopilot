LPT: if you’re trick or treating with a child with food allergies, bring your own candy!

content:
I buy candy and small Halloween toys for my three year old who has a bunch of food allergies. Before he walks up to the house, I walk up and discreetly give my candy or toy (little spider rings, slime, etc.) to the owner, saying ‘would you mind handing this to the little boy there when he walks up? He has food allergies’. They’re always happy to do so! 

My son gets to experience trick or treating just like other children and is not disappointed. And it doesn’t put the burden on our neighbors to provide allergy friendly treats. And honestly, even if someone had treats that were typically safe for him, I wouldn’t feel comfortable accepting food that isn’t individually labeled anyway. This will be our third year doing this and so far it has been a big success!
