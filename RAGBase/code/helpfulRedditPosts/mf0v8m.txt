LPT: When you move out for the first time (or your kids are moving out) invest in a small tool box!

content:
When I moved out permanently for the first time, my dad set me up with a basic tool box. It has been by far the most used gift I’ve ever owned! 

Contents:
	Hammer
	Small screwdriver set
	Wrench
	Mixed screws and nails
	Tape measure
	Pencil
	Level

There have been a multitude of little things I’ve been able to do for myself e.g. I’ve not had to talk to a landlord about loose door handles, I’ve been able to hang artwork (straight!), I can fix a leaky tap... I built pretty much the entire back catalogue of IKEA furniture over the years without using their blister inducing ‘multipurpose tool’. 

My tool box has grown substantially since way back when, I’m proud of how self sufficient I am when I comes to fixing things, I’ve saved a boatload of money doing things myself and my landlords have been sad when I’ve moved out again as I don’t bug them about the little things.  Ring able to use the basic tools has also built my confidence and self esteem, I know I can’t take care of myself!


(Note: when I talk about fixing things in a rental, I mean things like loose screws or fixing wobbly shelves, I’m not doing major work that might cause damage!)
