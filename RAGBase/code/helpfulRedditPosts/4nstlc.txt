LPT: If you can't give blood the day or two after a large tragedy, wait and give a week or two afterward.

content:
After all of the people who give that same day, the local banks will likely have enough for a WHILE. But blood only has a "shelf life" of about 40 days. 

Often people will see that so many people gave recently and will not give a week or two from now. This means that, after the shootings today, on July 22 or so Orlando blood banks will likely hit a huge low point. 

If you haven't given today, wait until next week and give. Or the week after. If you have given, give again in eight weeks. 

EDIT: Last sentence have/haven't. 

EDIT 2: Changed "three weeks" to "eight weeks" before you donate again per messages some of you have sent.

EDIT 3: At /u/J0my's suggestion: Even if you're not in the area where the event happened give anyhow, it can help an overall blood shortage problem. Also, you *might* want to make extra sure you give this time since a large portion of the community targeted cannot give blood.
