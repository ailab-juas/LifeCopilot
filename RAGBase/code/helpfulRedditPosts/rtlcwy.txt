LPT Do not lend money to people without jobs or history of employment, including friends and family.

Edit: Everyone falls on hard times and needs a little help now and again.  This post isn’t about them.  It isn’t about those who just a need a hand to get over the hump, or just need a little pick me up to get out their current status.  No, friends, this post is about those who are attempting to misuse your relationship with them for their own ill gotten gains.  Those who would ask you to give both kidneys and a liver because they have a drinking problem with no plan to change it.  They want to continue drinking and want you time enable them.  But with money.

I always thought this was common sense, but I’ve seen so many posts recently about this it blows my mind.

If someone you know is asking for money, and especially if they don’t or haven’t had a job, do not lend them money.  They will not be able to pay you back even if they mean to.  Because they have no way to make more money.

Asked you out to dinner, but they “forgot” their wallet?  That’s a them problem.

Need some money for this “emergency” situation which is actually something they want?  That’s a them problem.

Want something you have that you worked hard for and aren’t using right now?  That’s a them problem.

If you feel you must lend them money, ask them to write up a contract detailing explicitly how and when they will pay you back.  Considering adding interest depending on the amount ad length of the loan. Both of you should sign said document and both should have a copy.

Edit:  To those friends and family you do loan money to, assume it’s a gift and if you happen to be reimbursed consider it a bonus.  Also, if you’re in a relationship, please check-in with them first before sending out money.
