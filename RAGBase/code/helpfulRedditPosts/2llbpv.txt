I'm not much of a casino-goer, but my gf drags me along on occasion, and I did a 3-day vacation in Vegas a few years ago.

For the Vegas trip, I had 100 limit per day.  In the morning, I broke the $100 into $5s, and set out.  I would put in one $5, and if I lost, I'd decide if I was still having fun.  If I was, I'd put in one more.  If that one failed, I'd move on.  If I wasn't having fun on the machine, I'd move on.  If I won and got up to $8-10 or more, I'd cash out and pocket the voucher, and pretend it didn't exist in regard to my daily limit.

At the end of the day, I'd cash out my vouchers and leave the winnings separate, using only the $100 limit for the next day.

By the end of 3 days, and having run through the full $300 in cash, and even having a couple of $5-10 souvenirs, I left Vegas with $250.

My gf had paid $200 for flights and hotel, and food was separate from my gambling money, but I'd had 3 days of gambling, sight-seeing, etc, for $50.  To me, it was money well spent.
