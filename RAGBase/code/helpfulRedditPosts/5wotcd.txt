LPT: Need to make a phone call but don't want the recipient to know your number? Dial #31# before the number, it will show up as 'Unknown number'

content:
I have been using this LPT since I was the proud owner of a Nokia 3310 and I thought I would share. I know you can just change the caller ID settings on most phones these days, but this makes it easier when making a single phone call and you don't have to change it back after the call.

In some countries, the pre-dial code is different. See list below:

Albania: #31# (cell phones)

Argentina: *31# (landlines) or #31# (most cell phone companies)
