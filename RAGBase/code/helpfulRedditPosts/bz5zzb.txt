LPT: If you have a favorite movie you’ve seen several (or hundreds) of times, try watching it with subtitles/closed captioning on. You might be surprised just how many lines you heard wrong or missed entirely.

content:
It is especially useful for content dense movies, ie. Saving Private Ryan. If you are a fan of the movie I highly recommend starting with this one... total game changer for me.

EDIT UPDATE:  Many have pointed out the subtitles are only as good as the people typing them, but after a lot feedback from industry professionals I thinks the odds are very good the subtitles are more adequate than my ability to hear it correctly without them.  Also, there seem to be some downers who “who have been doing this for years”, and to you I say, why didn’t you share your LPT sooner?? I could have been doing this for YEARS.

EDIT UPDATE 2:  Thank you so much to everyone commenting and contributing to the conversation!  I have seen so many great ideas about how to use this to learn a language and how to watch movies with a newborn/any age child in the house!
