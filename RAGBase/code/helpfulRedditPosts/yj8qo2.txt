LPT: WD40 is not a good substitute for lubricating grease

content:
WD40 is a great product with a lot of uses, especially inhibiting rust and helping to free moving metal parts that are rusted in place.

  
It's not great as a lubricant for parts that need to move freely and will be exercised often, like hinges. It will work in a pinch, but it's not optimal. It contains solvents that evaporate quickly, so it does not provide long-lasting lubrication. If you have moving metal parts, like hinges, latches, axles, etc., and want to eliminate squeaks and keep them working well, a sprayable grease, like white lithium, is the way to go.
