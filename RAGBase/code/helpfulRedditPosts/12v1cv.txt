LPT: Work in an office? Use a small container for water rather than a large one. This will help remind you to get up and move around more often.

Paper containers may not be the best for the environment, so even a ceramic coffee mug or smaller glass container.

I often find myself wanting to bring my large thermos to work for convenience, then I remind myself that sitting at your desk longer isn't a convenience at all. It's so important to get up and move around often! Sitting is bad for you.

Stay healthy out there.
