LPT: if you’re a manager/supervisor of any kind, say “thank you” to your team every once in a while, even if it’s non-specific. Even the smallest amount of thanks/appreciation goes a long way to boost workplace morale

Edit: everyone saying they want a raise - you earn more money by doing work at a level above what is expected and *earning* more money. It’s not just handed to you for doing what you’re expected to do anyway. 

A “thank you” from a manager is acknowledgment that you’re being a productive member of the team, moving the team towards its goal. If you’ve never worked in an environment where managers don’t say “thank you,” you’re lucky. It makes tedious work even more soul-crushing
