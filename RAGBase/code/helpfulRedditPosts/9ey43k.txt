LPT: Don't treat work devices like personal ones. Keep a separate phone, don't put all your personal things on work PC or run your life from work

content:
Working in HR, I've seen too many people get in trouble for keeping all their personal sh!t on a work phone or laptop. Companies in the US have access to all that data. I've seen people who can't survive when we take back their work phone on the last day and all their photos are on there which they never backed up, calendars of their kids sports schedule etc.

  


Just keep a separation between work and home life.
