LPT: Don't scream at your kids for leaving lights/fans on.

content:
It costs about 5Â¢ a day for your average 10watt led to be on for 24hours. It's not worth yelling at your kids over something so trivial. If you are the type of person who gets angry over something so simple, take some steps to overcome it.

Home Depot sells motion sensor light switches for $20. And timer switches for $25. Have a better relationship with your kids and stop ruining the relationships with your kids over a few cents.
