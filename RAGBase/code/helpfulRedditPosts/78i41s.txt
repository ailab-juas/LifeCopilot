LPT: If someone doesn't appreciate something you do for them, it probably means that it isn't that important to them. Rather than stew about it or demand recognition, just add it to the list of things you don't need to do anymore.

Or, if it just needs to get done, suck it up, buttercup. We don't get gold stars for effort in real life.

An example of what I'm talking about here is that I used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. Often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  At first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  The answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether I do it or not. Now I don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

I also noticed that I was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. People would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated I was doing it. I stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. Now I only do it if I feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

These are all things *I* would appreciate if someone did *for me* but that doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way.
