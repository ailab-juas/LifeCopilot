title:
YSK that you might be one of the 1-3% of people cannot visualize stuff at all. It can interfere with certain methods of teaching and therapy techniques. Most people who can't visualize don't realize it until it's pointed out to them (because they don't realize that other people can).

And if you are one of the people who has ever sat there confused and lost while everyone else does some sort of 'imagine you are on a beach' exercise, you might just be one of them.

This may seem silly to everyone who can, but YSK most people can actually 'visualize' that beach in their head. They can come up with a sort of mental image of the beach. The clarity might vary, but they can actually visually imagine things.

If you can't do this at all, it's called aphantasia, and it's not a big deal really and not uncommon, but if you are part of this group, you should know it about yourself. Because a lot of people don't.

A lot of psychology and therapy methods involve visualization, and these aren't remarkably useful for people with aphantasia. You could waste a lot of time struggling with a technique that is doomed to fail.

Some methods of teaching things like spelling or math rely on visualization and if you (or a kid) have aphantasia, these methods can make no sense and you might not realize why, and an alternate method would work better.

Why YSK: You should be aware if you have aphantasia, and if you don't you should still be aware that some people think in a different way than you do. And if you are a teacher, psychologist, etc. it could be relevant to helping other people.
