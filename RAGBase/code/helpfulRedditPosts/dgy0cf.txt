LPT: You can configure your adblocker to automatically block all "You're using an adblocker!" annoying messages

content:
For uBlock Origin users:

1. Right click the extension icon and then Options. A new tab will open.
2. You'll see a few sub-tabs, click on "Filter lists"
3. Under "Ads", tick the box that says "Adblock Warning Removal List"
4. If a warning icon appears beside it, click "Update now" on the top

Done!

**Edit:** for non uBlock Origin users

&amp;#x200B;

* **AdBlock Plus\***

Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Filter Lists &gt; Adblock Warning Removal List &gt; Active (Thanks u/RedditDumpsterFires)

* **AdGuard**

 Ad Blocker &gt; Scroll down to add filter &gt; AdBlock Warning Removal List is down under annoyances (Thanks u/fishychan)

* **uBlock\***

 Enable "Adblock Warning Removal Listâ€Ž" under "3rd party lists" (Thanks u/picartman)

\------

\* Keep in mind that uBlock is not private as it collects your personal data and that Adblock Plus' performance could be better. uBlock Origin solves both of these issues. I won't post the direct link to the sources as the last time I did that my LPT got removed, but you can google *"uBlock (non-Origin) adds user tracking, make sure your users have uBlock Origin!"* and *"Adblockers Performance Study DEV Community"* for more info.
