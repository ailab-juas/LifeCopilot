title:
YSK when giving young kids gifts this year from Santa, make them modest gifts, put your name on the new video games or expensive gifts.

content:
Many young children will compare what Santa brought them. Less fortunate children likely will receive modest gifts like clothing. These kids will often feel as Santa hates them or cares less and that's why their gifts are budget items when compared to the new TV or game console another child received. Plus you get to take credit for the good gifts.
