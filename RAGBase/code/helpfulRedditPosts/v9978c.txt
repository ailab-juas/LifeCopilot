title:
LPT: When you’re leaving for a trip, plan to be packed and ready an hour before you need to leave, then spend that hour tidying up your house. This serves three purposes.

content:
1. If something goes wrong you can be delayed an hour and still leave on time. 

2. You’ll get to return to a tidy house. 

3. By walking around your house and thinking about something else, you’ll have a much better chance of suddenly remembering something you forgot to pack.
