LPT: If you spend most of the day on a computer, follow the rule of 20s.

content:
The rule is that every 20 minutes you need to stand up and look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, while blinking 20 times. 

This will greatly reduce eye strain from your monitor. You can also throw in something like 20 squats or calf raises to get the blood moving in your legs.
