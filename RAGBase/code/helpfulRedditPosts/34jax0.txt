title:
LPT: If you are hitting a roadblock in your job search because you lack the required experience, go volunteer in something that is related to the job sector you are applying for.

content:
Volunteer groups are often willing to accept you regardless of your experience, just as long as you are willing to work. You will be able to gain experience and network which you can use to help you in your job search. 

edit: Volunteering 1 hour a week is still good; better than no experience. 

edit 2: This is a last resort thing after you have exhausted other options.
