LPT: If you need/want a casual gift to give to friends or family when you visit, find a bakery that sells an amazing country-style bread. It's always relatively cheap, but just pricy enough that people won't regularly buy it for themselves so it feels like a nice treat.

I've started doing this recently when I discovered a cafe down the road from me bakes and sells their own bread. It's absolutely the best bread I've ever had (chewy on the outside but amazingly soft on the inside) and is just perfect with a bit of butter. 

Since it costs $7 AUD ($5.10 USD) it's just expensive enough where the average person wouldn't go out of their way to buy it themselves along with their regular shopping, but just cheap enough that it's not a burden buying it on my way to a friend's place. And they'll really appreciate it since fancy bread isn't something people often have.
