YSK If a tipped employee, such as a waiter, does not receive enough money in tips to make minimum wage, their employer must still pay them minimum wage. US Dept of Labor: "If the employeeâ€™s tips combined with the direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference."

You should know this because the classic argument for tipping is that the workers need the tips to make minimum wage.

Confronting this misconception could remove the illusion of burden from the public and place it more squarely on the employers where it belongs.

By doing this tips would be optional and generous, not charity. 

Social pressure should not be a part of tipping, imo, especially since the reason most people tip is based on lies.

I understand some servers might claim that the burden on them to prove that they didn't make enough tips to reach minimum wage was not fair... but the truth is that it isn't fair for employers to expect the public to support their workers and that is what needs to change.

On another note, tips are self reported to IRS and I would bet you a dollar that the actual incomes of people who receive tips are way above what they report.
