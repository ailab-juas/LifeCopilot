LPT: Kids asking "How far?" on a long road trip? Teach them how mile markers work.

content:
I tried this with my 7YO daughter today and it worked like a charm.  She spent the rest of the trip to Grandma's House counting down to landmarks (miles to Grandma's state's line, miles to Grandma's city, miles to the exit, etc)....instead of asking me, "How long until we get there?" every fifteen seconds.

Edit - For those asking, here's how mile markers work: http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm

Also, I do have GPS (I don't live under a rock, *jeez*).  But my kids can't see it in the back seat, so this is a way for them to see how far we have to go without asking me.
