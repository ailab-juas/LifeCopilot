LPT: Booked a car rental far in advance? Check the rate again when you're closer to the start of the rental - you might have a lower one you can use instead.

You can then cancel and re-book the lower rate, or call a customer service line to do that. I have saved hundreds of dollars by doing this, and the customer service agent even waived any cancellation fees!
