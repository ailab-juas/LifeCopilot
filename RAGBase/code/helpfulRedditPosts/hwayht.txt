LPT: If you give your child an stuffed animal and they seem to love it, try to buy a spare

Well wish that was done with me at least, when I was a child I had a Minnie Mouse plush I loved with all my heart but parents ended up losing it. So yeah, that might make your child’s day in case something happens to it

Edit: thanks for silver! Also for people asking in comments, my parents forgot a bag with some medicine and the plushie when I was 4 in the roof of the car when heading home from my grandma. It’s been 20 years since then and I no longer miss it but I had a few sleepless nights and some tears were shed.
