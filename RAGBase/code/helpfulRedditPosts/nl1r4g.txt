LPT: When you are on a call with someone and you have them on speakerphone, give them a heads up by saying something like “Hey John, I’m here with Mary and I’ve got you on speaker” to give them a heads up and spare both of you from potential embarrassment.

Not speaking from experience or anything.

Edit: to those of you who pointed out my repetitive, poor phrasing: yes, great job. I typed this up in the car after thoroughly embarrassing myself on a call with my husband when he was at work so I was in kind of a place. You are very smart. Gold star. 

Also, to those pointing out that this is common sense and duh, everyone knows this, you are also very smart. Double gold star.
