LPT: Act as if you're a guest in your own home from time to time.

content:
Growing up I was always told, "leave a place better than how you found it." This LPT is aimed at couples who are having a hard time splitting chores around the house, but it can work for anyone.

Whenever someone allows me to stay in their home, I make sure the dishes are done after a meal, the laundry is taken care of if I'm there for more than a few days, and that the place is clean. But I found that when I was home, things were easy to put off for the next day.

If you act like a guest in your own home from time to time, it's easier to get some of those annoying day-to-day chores done without anybody nagging you to do them.
