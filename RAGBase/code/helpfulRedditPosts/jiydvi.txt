LPT: if you’re going somewhere you risk losing your phone (festival, concert etc) write down “if found please call...” and your companion’s phone number, and take a photo of it then make it your Lock Screen picture

When someone picks up your phone they can call your friend and arrange to get your phone back to you. I’ve successfully used this system more times than I like to admit. 
Not all phones have emergency contacts set up and many people don’t know how to access them anyway.
