LPT: Tell yourself you: "Want" to do something. Not that you: "Have" to do something.

content:
Whether you "Have to" do something for School, or Work, Don't tell yourself that you: "*Have* to" do it, but rather Think: "I *Want* to"

For example if you have homework tell yourself: "I **want** to get this done because I **wan**t to pass this class because I **want** to give myself a competing edge in the job market because I **want** to make more money because I **want** to be able to do things I **want** to do". It's all for yourself. You want to do it.
