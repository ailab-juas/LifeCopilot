LPT: Be the friend who initiates contact once in a while.

content:
Be the friend who initiates contact once in a while. It will mean a lot to those who feel like they ALWAYS do it.


Edit: I have read every reply so far and I realize my initial post above struck quite a cord with A LOT of people here but not as I intended. I honestly meant it as a "Hey, reach out to those who always do the reaching out, it could mean a lot" post and now I see just how many people (like me) really do tire of initiating contact, sometimes to the point where people give up entirely. My heart hurts reading some of these replies and highlights the need for those "friends" who truly never initiate contact to do so; they might just save or rekindle an entire relationship.
