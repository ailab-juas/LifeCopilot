LPT: While in college, check your required courses in your major and see if there's anything you can get a minor in without taking many (if any) classes outside of your already required work.

So, an example: I'm a music education major pursuing a bachelors degree, planning for a masters degree. I've got to take 4-6 classes in music theory. So I just applied for a minor in theory, and will probably get an associates degree in theory (and probably composition even though there are like 2 classes outside of what I already have to do) without even taking stuff outside of your major.

Obviously check and see if your institution allows this, I'm not sure if they all do, but this is a good way to make you more desirable in a job market, as well as give you more leverage with raises and other benefits.
