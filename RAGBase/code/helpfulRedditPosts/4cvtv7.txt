YSK of Unckecky, a Windows program that automatically declines unwanted program installation

content:
From [their website](https://unchecky.com/):

&gt; Have you ever felt, while installing software, that the installer tries to push additional unwanted programs at all cost? Ever missed a checkbox, and spent hours afterwards removing adware? Ever opened your browser after an installation, only to find out that you have a new homepage, a new search engine, or even a new browser?

&gt; Unchecky aims to keep potentially unwanted programs out of your computer.

&gt; Unchecky automatically unchecks unrelated offers, both saving you mouse clicks and making it less likely to miss a checkbox of an unwanted offer.

&gt; Installers often try to sneak additional programs as a natural part of the installation. Unchecky warns you when you try to accept a potentially unwanted offer, which makes it less likely to be accepted accidentally.

&gt; Install and forget. Unchecky automatically updates whenever a new version is available, so you don't have to worry about running the latest version.
