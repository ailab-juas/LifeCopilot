LPT: if you're shy and have trouble starting a conversation. Start talking to old people

content:
I used to be really shy. I still am but now I'm able to approach people and actually have an engaging conversation. This was always hard for me and I'd always wait for people to approach me first. I just started talking to elderly people. Grocery stores, Wendy's lineup or even just sitting on a bench. Old people almost always want to talk to younger people. They will never tell you to get lost and stop bothering them so there's no fear of rejection and typically you can find something you share in common/to talk about. Then if the conversation starts to die you can just leave. You're probably not talking to make a friend so there's no real pressure. This helped me beat my social anxiety, I don't get that same nervous feeling when meeting new people now. Hopefully it can help you
