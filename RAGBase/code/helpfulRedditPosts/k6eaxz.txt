LPT: Efficiency and Productivity are for work-related tasks, computers and the economy, not your life. Slow. Down. You are worthy of your own time. Savour your mind.

content:
We have built a culture of urgency, and therefore anxiety, around our daily lives. Everything has to be more efficient. We must be more productive, or else we are not worthwhile. It has become a religion to outdo each other's forever exaggerated techniques for "optimising my performance." This has bled out of the corporate world, via sophisticated marketing strategies and social contagion, and into our daily lives, habits, and internal philosophies.

\&gt; Podcasts have to be listened to at 2x speed;  
\&gt; We insist on multitasking while on the phone to our parents;  
\&gt; We take our coffee to go. 

We build evermore "productivity" into the way we consume the things we like. The faulty logic is if I do more things I like faster, I'll be happier. But **this creates a complete disconnect from the actual satisfaction we could derive from these things**, and forces us to run ever faster on the hedonic treadmill towards satiety. The more productive we are about our social, internal, emotional and intellectual lives, the less satisfied we are, and so the harder we feel we need to work to chase them. This creates a cycle of dissatisfaction. The dopamine hits can't come fast enough.

I implore you, for your own sanity, try the following things (even though the pandemic has made some of this harder, you can take away the **core** **meaning** of each one. Many of us are in lockdowns, working or studying from home, are no longer working, or businesses are closed for health reasons - some of these tips work even better under these circumstances, and we will appreciate the others  more when we are able to access them):  


* Don't get your next coffee takeaway. Sit down and turn your phone off and savour it out of a porcelain mug instead of a paper cup on your way to work. Leave a few minutes earlier, or arrive at work late. Watch the barista steaming your milk for you, filling your cup, making a little pattern on top and dusting it with chocolate - just for you. Watch the other customers talking amongst themselves. Study the tablecloths. Don't just drink your coffee, taste it. Life has lost all meaning if we can't sit down and enjoy coffee or tea or hot chocolate, but rather cram it into our bodies as a caffeine-injection system. If that's the only way you consume these beverages, **you're missing the point.** And if you can't get to a caf√© these days? Make something yourself at home, for yourself, and even for someone you live with, and pay attention to every step. Pick which mug you want to use carefully. Measure the coffee. Do it slowly. And when it's ready, sip it and look out the window. Take in the complete act of what you're doing. 
* Go to the pub with your friends, turn off your phones, and put them into somebody's backpack. Drink pints and talk shit. Repeat.
* Leave your house to go and walk. Do not plan a route or have a destination in mind. Walk, be conscious, and observe. You will need to come along with yourself. Get comfortable with that fact, and learn to love it.
* Literally stop and smell flowers.
* Try listening to podcasts at 1x speed and appreciating the level of technical effort that goes into producing a high-quality piece of audio journalism.
* Don't rush to finish your book by the end of December! If it's good enough for you to be reading it, read it slowly, and enjoy every single word the author crafted in just such a way as to convey their meaning to you. If you don't enjoy the book enough to read it slowly, stop reading it and start a new one. Life is too short to read books you don't like and won't remember anyway.
* Next time you feel thirsty, pull a glass of water from the tap and watch it fizz. Keep watching until the bubbles wrap themselves around each other and disintegrate on the surface. This water will become your lifeblood. Don't take it for granted. Taste the water until the glass is empty. Appreciate that glass of water and project a feeling of gratefulness onto it.
* Art is meant to be consumed **slowly.** Otherwise, why are you bothering?
* When was the last time you listened to music? No, no. I mean: when was the last time you listened to music?
* Whether you're on the phone to a friend, family member, secret lover or restauranteur, close your laptop and close your eyes. Give that person five minutes of your undivided attention. Let them feel how valuable you think their time is. 
* Write a letter to your friend and post it instead of writing them a Facebook or WhatsApp message. 

Efficiency and productivity are means to some ends and they have vastly improved our financial lives in many ways. But they are neither the means nor the ends to social, intellectual, creative or emotional satisfaction. **You are worthy of your own time. Spend it with yourself savoringly.**
