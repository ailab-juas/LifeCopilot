YSK: Balloon releases kill wildlife

content:
Why YSK:  People do balloon releases without being aware that doing so kills wildlife. The balloon strings get tangled in the legs of birds, the balloons themselves land in bodies of water and are eaten by the wildlife there, and more. 

If you do a Google search, it will bring up many images of the tragic consequences of doing balloon releases. The images are hard to look at, but it serves as an important lesson.
