LPT: If you are ever inflating a tire and you hear a zipper sound, run.

content:
Creeps standing behind you aside, the zipper sound is an indication the tire is about to blow. I have seen one too many people with "shotgun" blast trauma from exploding tires in the ER. Always check your tire conditions, and inflate to manufacturer specs (normally on the inside of your drivers side door jamb).


Edit: as shared by /u/kyoorius [Though the video is low quality, you can hear the sound(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYBGnLHpP0Q&amp;app=desktop&amp;persist_app=1)

Edit 2: Some examples of tire explosions for those asking about the damage equaling an ER trip. People can die from this, it is a lot of metal and rubber flying at you at high speed.
