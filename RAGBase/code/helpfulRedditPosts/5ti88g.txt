LPT: If you're new to a city or trying to make new friends, volunteer for a cause that's related to your hobbies or something you're interested in. People who volunteer tend to be good people, and if you pick a non profit or cause that interests you, you'll likely share other interests as well.

Also, volunteer regardless. It's very rewarding!
