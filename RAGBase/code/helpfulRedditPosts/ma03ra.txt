LPT - If you accidentally write on a whiteboard with permanent marker, scribble over it with a normal erasable marker and then erase it! It will take off the permanent marker as well!

All in the title, super helpful when this common mistake happens and you can wow your friends/coworkers.

EDIT: This is if you donâ€™t have any erasers, alcohol, etc. I was showed this trick in a place where all we had was markers. A lot of hypotheticals.
