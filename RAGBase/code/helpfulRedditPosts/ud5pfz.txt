Why YSK:
Asbestos causes intestinal and lung cancer.

It is impossible to remove asbestos from talc.

It's not just Johnson &amp; Johnson who have a talc/asbestos problem (they btw still market talc to mothers outside the US). 

Even an extremely small amount of asbestos in talc products can cause cancer in your lungs and gut (mesothelioma)

The FDA has no authority to recall cosmetics.

Make sure to check your makeup (even the expensive makeup can have talc and asbestos in it). I just found one of my favorite Bobbi Brown blushes has talc as the main ingredient.

I had absolutely no idea you can't remove asbestos from talc. 

I also had no idea the FDA can't recall harmful cosmetic products. It's only backlash from media that causes companies to remove it (Claire's for example).

We are on our own for educating ourselves on what we use. 

I learned all of this after watching an HBO documentary that discusses the dangers and showed the cancer victims describing their situations: https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYjJrvg7QksLDwgEAAAAG#

I am also a cancer victim now and used talc makeup extensively throughout my life. I want to make people aware of the dangers since, in the US, the FDA has no authority to remove these harmful products.
