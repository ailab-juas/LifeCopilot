YSK: Urgent Care clinics can do many things the ER can and for a smaller copay!

content:
Now, it's not a replacement for a full service hospital of course, but it's surprising what they can treat there. 

For example, stitches, IV treatment and many other services that don't require admittance can be taken care of at Urgent Care. 

It's faster, less wait, and copay is much cheaper. 

Edit: I should note, as others have mentioned, that not all Urgent Care clinics will offer the same services as others - it's in your best interest to call and find out before driving, but it is definitely worth the 2 minute phone call to see if certain services are offered there (such as stitches, for example)
