YSK that various tendon issues like RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) and CTS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) affect more and more people every year, and that there are easy methods to prevent or delay it.

Things like "[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome)" or "[Repetitive Strain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury)" (RSI) are things many people face who use their hands actively day by day.

This affects people from many fields, e.g. music (guitarists, and co.), office jobs and gaming (typing, pressing, clicking all day), and even cooks (cutting, etc.). Considering how much "precision work" our hands do nowadays, it isn't really uncommon for people to suffer from CTS or RSI anymore - but it can ruin careers and extremely affect quality of life, even for really young people (there are many who are &lt;18 years old and already suffer from RSI due to gaming).

The problem with injured tendons is that they don't really regenerate much by themselves, and instead form scar tissue which is less elastic and lowers functionality. It may result in simple things becoming difficult to do. Gripping stuff, playing your favorite riff or bassline on a guitar, or cutting onions.

Since it's easy to prevent or at least delay it, I thought I'd share with you some of the things you can do. Many of these things don't take long.

First, there are these [stretching exercises](https://imgur.com/a/voLETrx) (or "range of motion exercises" that many people do to alleviate present pain coming from strains. It's also kind of like a "warm up" for strains, so you can do these exercises before you engage in activities that heavily rely on your strains (even if it's just typing a large text). They don't take long to do and can be done pretty much everywhere. At work, at home, etc.. This one helped me personally (plus a few surgeries I had

Secondly, symptoms of strain issues are easy to recognize for yourself. Pain is the easiest recognizable part of this. Knowing about [where](https://imgur.com/a/yHKwvad) exactly your strains are will obviously help as well.

* The pain may get worse when you use the tendon.
* You may have more pain and stiffness during the night or when you get up in the morning.
* The area may be tender, red, warm, or swollen if there is inflammation.
* You may notice a crunchy sound or feeling when you use the tendon.

Pay attention to these things. If they happen, cool affected strains regularly and avoid putting them through more activities and alike (get rest for them).

Try changing your activities or how you do them. For example, if running caused the injury, try swimming some days. If the way you use a tool is the problem, try switching hands or changing your grip.

A good diet also influences it heavily. RSI can occur in legs and many other body parts as well, so make sure to stay fit to not unnecessarily put more strain on your leg tendons. And a bad diet can also increase inflammation risks.

If exercise caused the problem, take lessons or ask a trainer or pro to check your technique. To note, you might still have a correct technique, but your strains are used nonetheless.

If your job caused the tendon injury, ask your HR department if there are other ways to do your job or if you can take up other tasks.

Obviously, consult a doctor when you have issues. There are medical tools (splints, braces, casts, etc.) to help with this issue more effectively. The stuff above is just more of a "how to avoid it". There also is physical therapy and surgeries to help - but it's usually better preventing the issue from occurring in the first place. There also are braces, etc. you can buy online, but they might not perfectly fit you and help the way they should (or even worsen it) - so again, it's usually better consulting your doctor for treatment and alike.
