YSK: Why people who say "Sorry for the bad English" actually use big words and good English.

content:
When anyone says "Sorry for the bad english," they often mean that they are not experienced with the way people casually speak. When you learn a language, they teach it to you from the basics to the most complex words. If I learned advanced English, and tried to jump right into an area, I would know all of the big words and phrases, but not the local nuances and/or the general flow of words.

There are very different ways to speak a language (IE: saying "y'all" or "what's up?")
and schools of language often teach you the professional speak.
