title:
LPT : Try not to ask a woman you've just started dating through whatever app "what her worst dating story is" because sadly, there is a good chance it's not cringey or funny and actually traumatic.

content:
It's pretty much a buzz kill when a woman is still raw and coping with trauma and she says she was assaulted or worse. Or if she is forced to relive that memory because you phrased the question poorly.

The barebones empathy and people missing the point in the comments. 

edit

* "ThEy ShOulDnT bE DaTinG If TheY HaVe TrAumA." - People deserve kind human connections, just because they dont share their trauma doesnt mean that question wont illicit them reliving that in their head.

* EvErYoNe Is ToO SeNsiTivE" - caricatures of themselves.

* MeN cAn HaVe TrAuMa ToO"  - Ok, I guess we should miss the point entirely  

Imagine these are your contributions and the only thought you have when someone suggests that you slightly consider what asking a question in a certain way can entail.
