LPT: When paying a contractor pay the exact amount listed on the invoice. Don't round up.

content:
Contractor here... Lately we've had people paying their invoices by rounding up the total due ie... Paying $950.00 for an invoice this is $949.25

Doing this creates additional work, especially if the invoice is from the month previous. When that happens we have to re-submit a new invoice to our bookkeeper who then has to make an adjustment to our file (which we have to pay for). 

So please, if you are someone who rounds up because it's just easier or you think you are doing us a favour, stop. It costs us more to correct this than the extra 75Â¢ we are receiving.

Thank you for listening.
