LPT: When someone has a habit of replying "huh" after you say something do not instantly repeat what you said.

content:
From my experience, usually, people do in fact hear what you said and it is just a natural reaction to say "huh" to buy more time or just out of instinct. Often times if you just let it sit for a few seconds they will end up replying regardless to your initial comment.
