LPT: If you buy eggs or a dog from someone who raises either, make sure you ask to see the pen/kennel. Sometimes these people have their chickens or dogs in horrible conditions and you'd never know.

I had been buying eggs from a nice older couple who had a sign out front of their yard saying "Brown Eggs". I bought them for several months until one day when I knocked on their door and no one answered. I went towards the barn thinking maybe one of them were tending a garden or something. I saw the chickens huddled in a really small pen. I just left.

Second is the dog kennels. I work construction so get to see different buildings. For whatever reason people are starting up kennels. Most are really nice with extremely large yard for the dogs to run around, their housing is well insulated with plenty of room, heated floors, the works! This made me think of the puppy mills and how some people leave their pooches in horrible conditions. I'm glad not everyone is like this which is why I thought I should mention this in LPT.

If you see it, please report it.
