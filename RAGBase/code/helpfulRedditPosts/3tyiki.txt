Showing the world leaders that you care about the outcome is still possible, so consider that!!




Edit: (some explanation for the people that can not watch the video for reasons): COP21 is the 21st Conference of the Parties, i.e. the annual meeting of all countries which want to take action for the climate. It will be held in Le Bourget, France, from 30 November to 11 December. 
The overarching goal of the Conference is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase to 2 Â°C above pre-industrial levels.
There is a lot of pressure on this specific Conference to finally outline action and binding legislation.
