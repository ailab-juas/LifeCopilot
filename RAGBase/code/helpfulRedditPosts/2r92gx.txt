YSK that the cough after an upper respiratory infection (cold, bronchitis, sinusitis, etc.) lasts an average of 18 days and antibiotics do not shorten this.

The key thing to remember is that the 18 days is an average, i.e. there will be a sizable number of coughs that last even longer.  Keep that in mind the next time you get a respiratory bug.
