YSK You don’t need a Costco or Sam’s Club membership to use their pharmacies.

TIL that you can use both Costco and Sam’s Club pharmacies without having to obtain a membership. Most states require all pharmacies to be open to the public. Why YSK: In a world where prices are always increasing and saving every penny counts, it’s nice to have a few more options to look into for prescription savings. Especially for people who require large quantities or long term prescriptions.
