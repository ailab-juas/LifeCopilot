LPT: Going through a breakup? Change the background picture on your phone.

content:
I recently got broken up with and I noticed I had sad feelings every time I looked at my phone with no new text messages, I changed the background picture I had to something totally different and it made it much easier when checking my phone.

I know there's tons of tips out there for dealing with breakups but this one was a small change that really helped me out, hopefully it helps someone else out too!
