LPT: Monologueing kills your social life. Don't volunteer details about your life when no one asked. Arouse interest, then share when they ask!

content:
Monologueing is basically when someone makes a conversation one sided. It sounds a lot like someone talking to themselves but just in the presence of another person.

When we monologue it makes people tune us out which ultimately defeats the purpose of a conversation. To make it easy conversations should be 50 50. Obvs not everyone is talkative but also a large amount of people will just be polite and let you talk even though they really want to get some words in. Maybe they had something to say 30 seconds ago but you kept talking... For some reason.

Anyways that's my 2 cents. Monologueing is very frustrating in general when people wanna talk too.
