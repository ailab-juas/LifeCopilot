LPT: Medical scrubs make excellent pajamas. They're light, durable, reversible, and when you spend all day in your jammies everyone assumes you have important business they shouldn't interrupt.

content:
Everyone assumes you're up to something important rather than just being a slob. Plus you can make up all sorts of great stories.

When I had my first daughter the hospital put me in a set of scrubs to go into the operating room. I was probably supposed to give them back, but 6 years later they are still comfortable, and also useful. They can also be bought on Amazon and other sites.

Edit: to elaborate, since this is coming up a lot, I don't actually wear my pajamas out of the house beyond walking to the mailbox etc. No judgement here if you do though! (Well, except for whoever is throwing all the downvotes around. Wtf yo?)
