LPT : the best thing you can do for your adult children is try your very best to remain healthy and financially self sufficient

content:
My husband and I are both dealing with parents who didn't adequately plan for their retirement and are facing financial hardship. It's placed incredible stress and distress on us as individuals and as a couple, at a time in our lives when we're trying to build our careers, financial stability and a family. Plan for your retirement folks, do not put this burden on your kids. Life is hard enough to figure out. Happy new year!!
