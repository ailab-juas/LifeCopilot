LPT: If everyone you trust tells you to stop associating with someone, you should at least listen to their reasoning.

content:
Obviously, not everyone's family will approve of their choice of significant other, friend, what have you. And I'm not saying to cut ties with someone because your weird uncle didn't like their political views. 

Sometimes, when you are close with someone, it can be hard to see their faults. This is amplified with romantic relationships. If you notice a trend of those around you not liking this person, having objections to them, etc, it could be a warning sign. 

Just something to keep in mind. I've seen one too many loved ones be hurt by someone after they were warned by friends and family.
