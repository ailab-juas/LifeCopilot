LPT: If you're thinking of adopting a new pet from the shelter and you already have other pets, ask to foster them for a week before you decide to adopt.

content:
I am a happy owner of 3 dogs and a pig (all rescues), but before the pig and our newest dog, we tried out life with a cat. It was an amazing cat and we asked to foster it for two weeks. However, my middle dog handled it great at first but over the course of 2 weeks we discovered he does not get along with cats at all. We were able to return the cat without the guilt of us anticipating we were the cats forever home.
We also paid the sponsor fee so that it couldn't be put down and would eventually find a home.
It really sucked, but we made a choice to that dog before the cat.
