LPT: Microwaving stale potato chips will return them to their previously crunchy state.

content:
Microwave stale potato chips for ~20-30 seconds and wait for them to cool down. Once they cool down, they'll become crunchy again. I wouldn't recommend doing it repeatedly with the same chips, but if you have a stale bag of chips and want to eat some of them, pop them in the microwave and they're good as new.  
I don't think this is considered common knowledge, but it's something I've been doing for years so I figured I'd share it here for in case anyone reading can utilize it.  
  
  
EDIT: Holy shit guys, I just got home from work and this blew up. I'm glad I helped some of you. I was expecting like 20 upvotes and a handful of comments, max. This was unexpected. Enjoy your crunchy chips.
