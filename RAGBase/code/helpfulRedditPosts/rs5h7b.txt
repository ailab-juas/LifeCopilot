title:
LPT: Stop doing other people’s jobs for them. It doesn’t make you a team player, it just adds to your workload.

content:
If you have a coworker, or manager that isn’t doing their job. Let them fail. If they ask for help, point them to information that will help them with the problem, but don’t do their work. 
If you do their work, all it will get you is their work and yours. Your manager will not promote you or give you a raise for it, they might even hold you back from promotions because you are too valuable to let go of.
