title:
LPT when you get older opportunity cost grows and what you thought you would always have time to do when you were younger suddenly doesn’t hit your personal “minimum required ROI” anymore. So whatever crazy things you want to do, do it as early as possible.

That also explains why older people often have quite similar and predictable lives. The high ROI activities are pretty similar for most people: make time for the family, spend some time exercising, meet up with some old friends, apply some of the knowledge and experience you’ve accumulated (eg a job).

You can still do whatever you want, but usually the “crazy/abnormal stuff” doesn’t make much sense anymore.
