YSK drying out skin to get rid of acne is a bad idea and might be making the problem much worse

content:
People with oily skin have an increased production of sebum - an oily secretion that protects your skin from bacteria and the elements. When too much sebum is produced it can contribute to acne, so just as with acne-prone skin, the temptation is to under-moisturise and dry out the skin.

However, this actually encourages your skin to produce even more sebum and encourages the development of acne. It is important to clean oily skin well to remove excess oil, but not to over-exfoliate, which removes the top layer of skin and can further encourage sebum production.
