LPT: If you have parents or family on fixed income, their finances have likely come under extreme stress with inflation but be to proud to mention it. Try to find stealth ways to chip in on the down low when you can. My method and another I heard of.

 So I convinced my dad that it just makes sense to put his credit card and address on my prime account to get the free delivery without him paying the fee. What I do as often as I can is pay for things on my card.

Another is keep an eye on their vehicle, try to find times to borrow it but fill it up with gas or if there is an issue they are praying doesn't bankrupt them, try to stealthily get it checked out or fixed, say you have a hook up, can use credit card perks or saw a deal you couldnt pass up.

Also try to be a little more patient with everybody in general. People are struggling and are worn out after covid to deal with inflation we havent seen in 40 years at least, especially the frontline heros from the pandemic that get paid poorly and likely have to spend money on gas.
