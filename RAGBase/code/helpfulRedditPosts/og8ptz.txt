LPT: If making a PB&amp;J sandwich for later consumption, put PB on both sides of the bread and the jelly in the middle. This will keep your bread from soaking up the jelly and getting soggy.

This also works with other sandwiches that use dressing. Place the meat on the bun and the dressing in the middle.

Edit: I worded that poorly. I meant butter both internal sides of the sandwich. Or both slices. It’s not that big of a deal though, we have all made sandwiches before, so we know what’s being said here. 

Also, thanks for the awards and upvotes.
