LPT: How to quickly unstuff your nose.

content:
I have seasonal allergies and it seems that no matter how many times I blow my nose, it’s still stuffed. My doctor taught me a trick:

**0) Wash your hands**

1) Inhale lightly

2) Exhale completely then hold your breath

3) Pinch your nose shut then nod your head like you’re agreeing with someone until you get the urge to breathe

4) Inhale and repeat 3-5 times

Works every time for me
