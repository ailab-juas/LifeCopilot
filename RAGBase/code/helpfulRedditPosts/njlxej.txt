title:
YSK: Smoking (and vaping) significantly increases mens' risk of erectile dysfunction

content:
The chemicals in cigarettes cause poor circulation, doubling a man's chances of getting erectile dysfunction. Because nicotine constricts blood vessels, vaping it can also cause erectile dysfunction.

Why YSK: Many people talk about the future risks of cancer with smoking. But there are a ton of other, often more immediate, risks including erectile dysfunction.

Edit: I want to add that many states and countries have FREE smoking cessation programs. So it isn't something that needs to be done alone, even if you can't pay for help (although paid help can often be covered by insurance as well).
