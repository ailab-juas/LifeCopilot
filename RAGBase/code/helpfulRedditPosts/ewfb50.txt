LPT: When you have to cry at work

content:
When I was going through a divorce, I’d have to cry every once and while at work. When you’re feeling really overwhelmed, go for a walk around the block a few times - try to look around at the spaciousness, especially the sky. 

If you can’t do this, get to a bathroom stall and cry it out there, then you can wash your face to help with your irritated, puffy eyes. If you’re tearing up and someone approaches you, you can fake a yawn before you start talking to collect yourself. 

It will get better. A lot of people have felt exactly how you’re feeling now and there is a beautiful solidarity in that pain. Much love.
