title:
LPT: at work, when a new task comes up, use this rule: if it takes less than 5 minutes, do it right away. If it takes less than 20 minutes, do it right after your current task. If it takes longer than 20 minutes, schedule the task for later. You'll prevent a piling up of small tasks or forgetting.

Yes, I know, this wouldn't work for every job. But for those who find it useful, I hope it helps.
