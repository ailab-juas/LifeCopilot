LPT: Have a sheet of paper beside you when you are trying to get work done to write down anything that pops into your head. This will prevent you from going down any rabbit holes on the internet if you had instead used your phone or computer to look it up.

Even if we think we're just going to look up one thing real quick and get back to work, it isn't always that easy. Having the sheet of paper allows us to maintain our workflow and deal with those unrelated thoughts some other time.

Edit: thanks for making this my top post of all time! Glad I could help people become more productive :)
