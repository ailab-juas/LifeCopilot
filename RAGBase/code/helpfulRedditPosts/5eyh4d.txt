LPT: The best way to remember new words - do a Google Images search of it.

content:
As a part of my preparations for a test required that I improve my English vocabulary. However, the meanings of some words were really difficult to remember. I used to do a Google News search of the word to see examples of the word used in context (an earlier LPT I saw here). One day I clicked on Google Images by mistake and saw a picture related to the word 'contumacious' and instantly knew that I wouldn't forget it. I had similar results with the word 'alacrity'. Now I do a Google Image search of every new word I come across. 

Note: The less common the word, the more effective Google Images search
