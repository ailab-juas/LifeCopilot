LPT: To turn off someone’s iPhone alarm without getting up, call the phone.

content:
My sister has decided she wants to be more productive and try to wake up by setting alarms between 6am and 9am. She doesn’t wake up and just lets the alarms ring at full blast until 10am or longer, waking me up from across the house. I’ve found that calling her phone silences the alarm without getting up to do it myself, and have been using it ever since! Felt this might be useful for people in quarantine or for housemates / roommates. 

It’s also useful for when someone is away from their phone but the alarm starts ringing!



Edit: for people sending me mean messages about my sister, she’s normally super sweet so although she sometimes does it to be petty, she’s just a super deep sleeper.

Edit 2: this was my first post in LPT and I didn’t expect this to blow up so much!! I’m so excited that so many people find this helpful - hope you all get lots of peace and quiet!
