YSK that email etiquette goes a long way and your question is likely to be answered much faster if you're nice.

**Why you should know**: because being polite to people who get the same enquiry 20 times every day will get your problem sorted much faster.

I work in a college, and my job is to make sure applicants get housing. Every year, there is a waiting period before we allocate housing which applicants are informed of *many* times, and we get emails ranging from:

*'Dear XXX, I know you get this question a lot but when might we hear about housing allocations?'*

to:

*'Why have my friends heard about housing and not me? I'm pissed with waiting.'*

(Both are verbatim)

The former **will definitely get answered first**, even if it comes in later. When you send an email to a company, you're sending a written correspondence to a human who is often paid the least in their office for very repetitive work. It is commonplace among my colleagues and colleagues in other colleges to basically not give a rat's ass about your enquiry at all.

In the case of the former, employees may even use loopholes in the bureaucracy to help you out and give as much information as possible.

In the case of the latter, employees will likely make use of the absolute official channels to ensure you get drowned in a sea of bureaucracy; you'll be restricted by the letter of service level agreements, and your email will absolutely not be a priority.
