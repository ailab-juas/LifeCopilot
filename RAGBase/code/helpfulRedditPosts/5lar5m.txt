LPT: If you are considering a major behavioural change as a “New Years Resolution” it is worth looking in to the Transtheoretical Model of Change. It involves several stages over time rather than (impulsively) trying to make a major life change “overnight”, and it not at all difficult to understand

It is tempting say, “I am going to stop/start [insert habit here] in 2017, starting January 1st!” because tradition and you know you want to or need to. But major life change takes more than a decision: it takes planning, time, dedication  and *practice*. The Transtheoretical Model, developed starting in 1977, offers a template of stages that engage you in a process of change over time. Think of it as slowly shifting gears—up *or* down, depending on your goals. Rather trying to get rolling from zero in fifth gear or stopping from 55 by slamming into PARK, your engine (body/mind) will thank you!

Making major changes in your life is *hard*, but understanding this model is not.
