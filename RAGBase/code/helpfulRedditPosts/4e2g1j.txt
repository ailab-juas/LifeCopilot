LPT: Record your voice for the people who love you.

content:
My father passed away at the beginning of March due to cancer. One of the things I now cherish most are the handful of his voicemails I have on my phone. None have deeply meaningful messages, they are all pretty standard voicemails of missed calls from a parent. Some are confirmations for dinner plans later in the week, some are ideas he thought would make millions but already exist, some are the classic "just checking in bud" messages. 

However, hearing his voice, knowing now I can't call him back or ever hear it in person again, is sacred. It brings me to tears listening to them but it also instantly puts a smile on my face. I think everyone should take some time, whether it's once for a few minutes, or biweekly sessions, to record some type of message for their loved ones. The important part doesn't have to solely be in which words you say, but rather in the fact that you are saying them. Today's technology makes this extremely easy. 

Death is the one certainty we all must face. When each of us is gone, our voice is comfort to the people we love. 

Edit: Thank you for gold kind giver! 
The responses are beautiful and invoke heavy feels. It's nice reading about others who have similar experiences, who have access to such memories, or those who will create them. Making copies / backups is important, some of the ways people have done this is truly creative and heart warming. Everyone grieves differently for lost loved ones, but in my opinion, the pain of cherishing their memories trumps the fear of forgetting them, only love can hurt so much.
