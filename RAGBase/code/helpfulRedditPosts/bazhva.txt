title:
YSK that spraying flies with windex will knock them out of the air rather quickly, allowing you to easily get rid of them.

content:
Plus, you can clean your windows at the same time.

Other things that work: 

* water in a spray bottle is about as effective
* Febreze, if you want your place to smell nice at the same time

Windex and Febreze also work to varying degrees on wasps, bees, gnats, fruit flies, moths, and beetles.  Febreze apparently is great for killing ants, too.
