title:
YSK what to do if you find a litter of kittens

content:
First, **Wait**. Don't handle them. The mom might be out looking for food or hiding nearby.

Second, **Watch**. Keep an eye on them from a safe distance but not so close you scare the mom away. She should be back within 4 to 6 hours. Kittens donâ€™t need to be with their mom 24/7.

If the mom does not come back within about 6 hours, and you believe they are in danger, you can **contact your local animal shelter about next steps. Some shelters will not have room, so check first.**

Why YSK: If the kittens are 'kit-napped' Mom will lose the ability to provide essential nutrients and early socialization. Bottle kittens are resource and time intensive and many shelters do not
have the ability to care for them. Kittens who are with their mom are given a better chance of survival!
