YSK about Google Scholar. It indexes "full-text journal articles, technical reports, preprints, theses, books, and other documents, including selected Web pages that are deemed to be 'scholarly."

scholar.google.ca 

If you are a student and on your school's network, most of the full articles can be accessed for free. If you are on a private network, only the abstract will be free for most, the rest (because they are commercial) will cost a fee.
