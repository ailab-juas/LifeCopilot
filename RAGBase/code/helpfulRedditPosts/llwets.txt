LPT: If youre ever using one of those spin the wheel coupon things on a purchase for a website and it gives you something like "meow10" try inputting increments of 5, like "meow20" or "meow30" because it's very likely its a super generic code and you got the crappier one for your purchase.

Edit: yes I realize I did increments of 10.
10, 15, 20, 25, 30. 
Better?

Also, someone mentioned you should start from higher up and go down so you don't miss a chance at a higher discount. Im sorry whoever you are I have lost you in the comments.

Props to u/debilitatingfart who posted something extremely similar a month ago and got no love
