YSK cats seek shelter under the hood of cars

Why YSK: 

Years ago I saw a post somewhere about someone finding a cat under their hood after hearing meowing while driving. This morning we moved our car into our driveway after it was parked on the street for a couple days, and heard loud meowing while in our house. I remembered the post and checked under the hood to find a frightened kitten. I know they say cats will go under hoods of cars for warmth during cold months, but I live in a hot, tropical climate, so itâ€™s possible anywhere. 

We brought the kitten to the vet for a checkup and shots. Iâ€™ve always wanted a cat ðŸ¥°
