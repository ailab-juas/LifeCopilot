LPT: Use all the paid time off that you earn at your job. Don't lose or forfeit it for any reason. This is YOUR time.

content:
At my workplace you can only carry over so much paid time off. Many people lose weeks of time off because of various excuses: too busy, nothing to do outside of work, afraid of losing their job if too much time off. The list goes on. We have to stop this. Start using your time off to do something that makes you happy!
