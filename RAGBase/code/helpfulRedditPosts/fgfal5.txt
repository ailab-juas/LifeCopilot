YSK you have rights when it comes to debt collectors. Just because you owe money does not mean you have to accept abuse.

If anyone has a similar resource for other countries, comment it and I’ll add it to the post.

Edit 2: this wasn’t supposed to turn into a “how to get out of your debt” tip but it kinda did. I wasn’t making any statement for/against debt. I just don’t think anyone should have to put up with illegal intimidation just because they have debt to their name. Pretty simple but I just don’t want to have to keep explaining that
