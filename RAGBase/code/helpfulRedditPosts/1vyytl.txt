LPT: College students and those soon-toÓºÅbe: Don't take your advisor's claims as gospel -- they are often mistaken -- always confirm things for yourself.

content:
In my experience, and those of many people I know, advisors tend to be lovely people who really want to help, but there is just way too much for them to keep track of, and they get it wrong a lot. Make use of your advisor as a resource but always be double checking until you see it in writing somewhere, and always look into alternatives and options yourself.

You may get a lot more out of your education that way, and it will likely save you many headaches and many "Why the hell didn't anybody tell me that?" moments.

**EDIT: Some additional tips from throughout the thread:**

* Keep a copy of every syllabus for every class you take. It may save your ass during a transfer credit dispute if you ever happen to transfer.

* Related to previous: Fight like hell for every transfer credit, you spent your time and money earning those credits, don't give them up too easily.

* Don't post LPTs from your phone, sometimes you get weird missing character boxes. 

* Check your own degree audit regularly (or get your checklist and do a manual "degree audit" regularly).

* Don't assume another student's story will apply to you.

* Getting your advisor's recommendations in writing, with a signature, may help you out down the line in some cases. (I wouldn't count on this though.)

* In the end, you're responsible for keeping track of your own graduation requirements. Keep an eye on this stuff yourself and you'll never need to worry about laying the blame on someone else.

* And yes, this is good advice for everything in life too -- **trust but verify**. (But the broader an LPT is, the less likely it is to connect with people.)
