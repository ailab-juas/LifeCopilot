title:
YSK that hard disk is most of the times the bottleneck on your computer

content:
Unless you are a gamer or for whatever reason you make an intensive use of your CPU for long periods of time, most probably when your computer feels slow it's due to the writing/reading to the hard disk.

If you are thinking about getting a new computer because it's become really slow, consider replacing your hard disk with a solid state one (SSD).

I've made this change in a couple of computers and the difference is just impressive, and for less than $100.

EDIT; grammar
