YSK that every credit card company has a secret Backdoor "recon"sideration line, where it rings directly to a person who very well can overturn your denied application. Details inside.

**Edit:** The whole "herp derp if you get denied you don't deserve one" is asinine and indicative of ignorance on how the (admittedly) screwed up credit scoring system works. Credit scoring isn't black and white.

Just because you get denied by an algorithm that has set thresholds doesn't mean you don't deserve a line of credit.  It just means you could be off by literally a few points and still very worthy and responsible.

This isn't a myth. This isn't the regular customer service line. Its a special, relatively unknown group of reps who strictly deal with reconsidering your application. These phone numbers generally never appear on the company websites. 

I just tried it with Chase and I have a credit card that I was denied for in the mail as we speak.

Now, before you go calling one of these numbers, please do a bit of research and Google best practices when calling these numbers.

You will be speaking to someone who has total power and discretion - so **be nice to the rep on the phone**. Know what you're going to say and be prepared to answer the questions straight up that don't get asked on credit card applications.

The above is key though to why this works. When you fill out an application, it pulls your credit report and the system auto approves/denies based on various factors. This is your chance to *explain why* you have those blemishes on your report. Be honest, tell them you were 20 and given a huge line of credit and weren't as financially responsible as you are now. Or whatever the reason was. 

Either way, as long as you don't have a completely horrible score, but are within arms reach, there is a very good chance they'll reconsider, and override the denial. Good luck!

Oh, and this should only be leveraged if you just recently applied but were denied, no more than a couple weeks or so.
