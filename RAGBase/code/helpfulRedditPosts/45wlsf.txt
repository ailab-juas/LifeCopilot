LPT: Never co-sign for a loan, contract or other financial commitment unless you're prepared to pay the whole amount yourself.

content:
Generally, if someone asks you to cosign for them it's either because 1.) they can't get approved on their own, or 2.) they've been approved (but at a high interest rate) and a co-signer would get them a lower rate. 

Cosigning isn't just "putting in a good word" for someone. It's asking you to cover their debt in case they don't. Lenders generally know how to assess risk, so when you co-sign, you're taking a financial risk that underwriting experts refused to. If the friend / family member / coworker you cosigned for falls behind (or just chooses not to pay his bills and party instead), you'll get the harassing calls demanding payment. It's a lose-lose situation: lose your friend/family member; lose your money.

Cautionary Tale Time: 

~12 years ago I thought I was doing a friend a favor by adding her to my cell plan. She almost immediately fell behind on the bill (even though it was less than she'd been spending on prepaid minutes). Had to cancel the line, eat the early-termination fee and a few months of service (about $300), but it was a valuable lesson learned. ~9 years ago my unemployed roommate on disability wanted me to cosign for a car loan. Needless to say, my prior experience easily overrode any feelings of sympathy I had.

EDIT: To those saying this ought to be common sense: ITT most commenters were burned by friends / family / SO's and those relationships trumped logic (i.e. "They're my _______; I can count on them!" or "Yes, I want to help you.") and they underestimated the chances they'd end up on the hook.

We're a cooperative species and people have had an innate desire to help others since before money even existed. That's a big hump to get over unless you've learned this lesson the hard way, or been educated about the many hidden dangers involved.
