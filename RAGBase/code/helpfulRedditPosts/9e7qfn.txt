LPT: When buying tickets for a sporting event for a large amount of people, buy some of the tickets in the row behind.

There's nothing worse than being a member of an 8 person social event and being stuck on one end of a row. You never get to speak with the people at the other end. Buying 4 seats in front of 4 seats for example, makes it easier for everyone to talk to each other.

Edit:  Okay, yes.  It should be a large number of people, not large amount of people.  I know it was completely unintelligible before.
