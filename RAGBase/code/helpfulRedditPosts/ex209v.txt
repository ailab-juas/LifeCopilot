LPT: Don’t get scared while watching horror movies by rooting for the antagonist

content:
A lot of the time during movies, I noticed that i was projecting myself in the situation of the protagonists of the film. This happens with any movie, horror movies included. When you start rooting for the monster, villain, or whatever the movie’s antagonist is, you project yourself into the position that is naturally in a state of advantage, changing your perspective to mock the flaws of the protagonists and respect their “genius” solution for concluding the movie. I do this with my friends all of the time, and it is great only jumping a little bit at the jump scares that catch you off guard.
