LPT: Cant decide if you're hungry? Ask yourself if you want an apple. If you answer "no" then you're probably not really hungry and just snacking out of boredom.

This little trick has helped me say no to junk food on several occasions. If I'm really hungry then an apple sounds pretty appetizing. If it doesn't sound all that good then I know I'm eating just to eat.  
Hope that makes sense.
