YSK the difference between less and fewer.

content:
Thought I'd throw this out there after seeing a recent popular TIL entitled - 'TIL Guinness has less calories than most beers, including Budweiser. It also contains several key vitamins'. Was also something my dad found much delight in correcting me on. 

Anyway, Oxforddictionaries.com explains it well:

**Use fewer if you’re referring to people or things in the plural (e.g. houses, newspapers, dogs, students, children). *Or calories ;)*.**

For example:
 
People these days are buying fewer newspapers. 
Fewer students are opting to study science-related subjects.
Fewer than thirty children each year develop the disease.
 
**Use less when you’re referring to something that can’t be counted or doesn’t have a plural (e.g. money, air, time, music, rain).**

For example:
 
It’s a better job but they pay you less money.
People want to spend less time in traffic jams. 
Ironically, when I’m on tour, I listen to less music.
 
Less is also used with numbers when they are on their own and with expressions of measurement or time, 

e.g.:
His weight fell from 18 stone to less than 12.Their marriage lasted less than two years. Heath Square is less than four miles away from Dublin city centre
