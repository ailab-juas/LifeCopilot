LPT: If you plan to visit someone in the hospital, call first to see if they want visitors. Many people prefer to be left alone during their recovery time.

As someone who has had quite a few hospital stays in recent years, I can say that for the most part I wanted to be left alone so I could sleep. Even when I was awake, I preferred to be alone because I looked and felt like crap and just wanted to watch TV.

On a few occasions I had multiple family members in my room laughing and chatting loudly like it was a reunion while I was in significant pain. Once I had to have a nurse kick them all out, receiving a few nasty glances as they were being shuffled out the door.

Of course, that was just me, other people might thrive on company when they're recovering. A quick phone call to the nurses' desk will make sure your visit is welcome.
