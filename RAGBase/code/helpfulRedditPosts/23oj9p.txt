I can't count, it is 18 days away (which I'm pretty sure is more than two weeks).  

Also, [81 countries celebrate it the second Sunday in May](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_day#Dates_around_the_world).  My deepest apologies to the rest of you for my unintentional slight.  I hope some day to be able to make it up to you.

Also, while I have your attention... I'm a father.  Before my daughter was born, I really didn't understand the love my parents had for me.  It is not the same as what I feel for them.  Please go out of your way this year to show your parents you appreciate their love and support, even if you don't feel it in the same way for them.
