LPT - If you have a presentation at school or even with job interviews try to go first, the teacher or employer will have nothing to compare you with and the chances of him seeing positives in you are higher, thus increasing your chances for higher grades/ chances of employment

content:
Combine this with simple things like dressing well, standing up straight, confidence, being well articulated etc,.. and you increase your chances even more since we all have prejudices when we first see someone, after that we keep trying to search for things to enforce our first thoughts about that person, since we dont like to be wrong. For example, you go to a job interview in a nice suit, well groomed etc,.. your employer then might think 'ok, he seems to be taking care of himself, looks good, looks intelligent,..' So during the presentation, when he also sees you're well articulated etc, those things will be used to enforce the first impression he had on you and he will be less likely to look for bad things.
