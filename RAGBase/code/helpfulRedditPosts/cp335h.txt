YSK that if you are a US citizen you can and should register your trip with the US State Department.

*if travelling internationally. Oops

Register your trip using STEP, the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/).

This allows the US Embassy to contact you in the event of an emergency, locate you, and help you; as well as contact any emergency contacts you designate and allow them to contact you in case something goes wrong.
