LPT: Always give people the benefit of the doubt if they tell you they are disabled or chronically ill. Lots of conditions are 'invisible' and invisibly ill folks get a lot of grief from not being believed. You'll be a better person for taking their word for it.

I hoped this was common sense, but in my 5 years of being chronically ill, I realize it isn't. Most people who have never been chronically ill or close to someone with an illness like mine simply don't 'trust' that I am not faking it because I 'don't look sick'. I understand it is hard to comprehend sometimes. And maybe it makes people confront their own mortality a bit and that can people uncomfortable and in denial a bit.

But it helps to just give people the benefit of the doubt or research chronic/disabling conditions you don't know a lot about. Avoids you looking like a jerk if they are actually sick, and they usually are if they say they are. Lots of people have hidden disabilities. And you will make the world and your life better by choosing to be empathetic vs. skeptical in this situation. Even if there are some illness 'fakers' out there, they probably have something going on that makes them that way and they are a minority. Most chronically ill or disabled people would rather feel good than sick and in pain. This will also help you avoid burning bridges because if someone finds out you thought they were just faking it, that is going to be a tough wound to heal.
