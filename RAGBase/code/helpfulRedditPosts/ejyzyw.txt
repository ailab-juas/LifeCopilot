LPT: when deciding on career paths, the day-to-day experience of performing a job should be weighed much heavier than the prestige or your imagined identity in a job.

I think this may seem like a "no-duh" tip to some people, but this is a trap it took me way too long to figure out and I see a lot of young people fall into.

What I mean is basically this: when I was 20 and I imagined different careers for myself, I essentially pictured myself at a party of some kind telling others what my job was. I never framed the question as "here's the kinds of duties and tasks I'll have to do.  Would I enjoy doing things like that?"  And I have many peers who became lawyers or teachers because they wanted to *be* a lawyer or teacher, then actually got into the field and realized they hate the experience of actually performing the tasks of the job.

Here's a much better way to approach it, in my opinion: I get the most fulfilment at work when I'm solving difficult problems that I know impact the business.  I don't really want anyone to report to me and I want to go to as few meetings as possible.  I also prefer to interact with other employees rather than customers.  And I like shorter projects that don't hang over my head while I'm at home.

That's just me and I found a good niche for myself that checks all those boxes, but when framed that way, I realized that you could find roles like that in many different departments in many different kinds of businesses.

The time you actually spend at work **dwarfes** the amount of time you spend telling people about your job so make decisions accordingly.
