LPT: Cut chip bags in half if you have pets

content:
My dog Riley passed away almost a week ago now and I can’t stop thinking about it. My wife was putting the kids to bed and I was showering. I finished up and headed downstairs. Normally Riley would be at the door waiting for me, this time she wasn’t. I noticed her laying down on the other side of the dining room table. I walked around the table to find her dead, her head in a Doritos bag. I blame myself for it, because I could have easily picked up that bag and put it away. I’m going to live with it for a long time. 

The one thing I learned from this is that it is pretty common. I’m just here to tell you to cut your bags in half vertically before you throw them away or cut them down to smaller sizes horizontally if you have a tendency to leave them out. 

TL:DR
Dog suffocated in chips bag, cut them up before you throw them away.
