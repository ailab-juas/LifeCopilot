YSK you can pick up baby birds with your bare hands and return them to the nest. The smell thing is a myth.

Edit: Also worth saying that if you find an injured or orphaned bird or other animal, please [contact a wildlife rehabilitator for advice](http://www.owra.org/find-a-wildlife-rehabilitator).

Edit 2: [Here is a flowchart (PDF)](http://wc.convio.net/site/DocServer/Found_a_Bird_revised.pdf) that addresses birds specifically, and goes into more detail to help you figure out if you need to help the bird or not, and if so what type of help you can provide (all the while not worrying about the smell thing).

Edit 3: [Here is the same flowchart but as an imgur link directly to the image](https://i.imgur.com/T1PxqGE.png).

Edit 4: If you happen to be wearing gloves, that's just fine. You can still return a bird to a nest with gloves on. Just know that you don't need them. So if you don't have gloves, it's all good. Grab that bird (but check the flowchart first) and pop her back in the nest!

Edit 5: So sorry to hear all the sad stories in the comments. One good thing to know also is that you shouldn't give food or water to an injured or orphaned animal in most circumstances. They can aspirate the water. You can easily (by accident) feed them food that is actually more harmful than not eating. [It's always best to contact a wildlife rehabber](http://www.owra.org/find-a-wildlife-rehabilitator) to get guidance. Each species is very different.

Edit 6: Another proactive thing you can do is build nest boxes to protect nestlings. Cornell has a great resource that includes [plans for building a nesting box](https://nestwatch.org/learn/all-about-birdhouses/right-bird-right-house/) for a large number of different types of birds. [Hungry Owl Project also does a great job with their owl boxes](https://www.hungryowls.org/).
