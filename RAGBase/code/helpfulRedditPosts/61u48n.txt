LPT- Go car shopping on the 13th-15th of the month.

Former car salesman here.

Everyone knows that you can often find better deals at the end of the month, but not everyone knows about the other sweet spot in the month where dealers are desperate to move product.

Most manufactures have a 'Fast Start' program where, if the dealer hits a mid-month sales goal, their monthly bonus from the manufacturer is higher than if they just hit their standard monthly goal, on the order of tens of thousands of dollars at times.

As such, dealers are often desperate to make deals around the 13th-15th. While you ~~won't~~might not get a car for invoice pricing, getting it for $500 over invoice as opposed to $1500 over invoice is a nice little bonus.

Salespeople, especially those who had a slow start, will drop their drawers in the hopes that you buy. This could mean free swag, gas, coupons/vouchers, or other little goodies outside the car itself.

EDIT: Changed a word.
