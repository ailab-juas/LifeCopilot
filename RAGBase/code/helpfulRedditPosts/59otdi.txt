title:
YSK there's a free alternative to Wolfram Alpha called Symbolab that shows all the steps

content:
It even formats your equation or expression as you enter it, making it easier to ensure you're entering it correctly.

It's not quite as robust as Wolfram, but it's very useful for showing the steps for integrals, derivatives, and limits.

Anyway, [here's the link](https://www.symbolab.com/).
