YSK: Food is one of the greatest gift for first time parents

content:
Why YSK: One of the greatest gifts for parents are when friends and family bring food AFTER the baby is born. There are other necessities such as diapers, clothes, etc. that are very much appreciated, but one of the hardest things as a parent of a fresh newborn is figuring out what to eat as a parent. 

My wife and I just had our newborn 2 months ago and realized that many of our friends that don't have kids typically gift us diapers or clothes. However, our relatives and friends that previously had a kid usually offered to bring us food. I realize now how thoughtful food gifts have been because through the craziness of trying to adapt to our new lifestyle and attend to our son's needs, it's been very difficult to take care of ourselves. 

We very much appreciate all the gifts that we've received, but food was completely unexpected to have made such an impact to make our whole day easier with one less thing to think about.
