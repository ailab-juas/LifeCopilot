LPT: When wearing a tie on a windy day, slip a coin down the inside of the hem to keep the tie from blowing all around.

I don't like tie clips, myself. So I am offering this as an alternative.

I loaned my skinny tie out... came back with a quarter on the inside of the bottom. Frickin' genius.

Obviously does not apply to ties with all seams stitched closed.
