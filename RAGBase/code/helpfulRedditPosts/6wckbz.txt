title:
LPT: When you're about to explain something, lead with "essentially" rather than "basically".

content:
Leading with "basically" implies you're explaining said thing because you feel like it needs to be dumbed down for the listener. This will often elicit a negative response and make the listener feel belittled. "Essentially" does not imply simplification, but brevity.
