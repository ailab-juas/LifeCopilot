LPT: If you’re ever thinking about something embarrassing you did x amount of years ago, try to remember something embarrassing someone else did. It will most likely be really hard if you can do it at all.

content:
In general, people only think about themselves, and when they think about others it’s in the context of how it will affect their own lives. This means that no one remembers that one time you said not to things for granite 5 years ago.
