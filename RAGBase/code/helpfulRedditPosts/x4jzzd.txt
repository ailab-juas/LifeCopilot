LPT: if you have to put your pet down, take the time as soon as possible to write yourself notes about all the quirks you loved about them.

I have been lucky to have loved two beautiful cats who lived long lives. They passed about eight years apart and I always regret not writing down the quirks my first cat had. Your memory of those small details you love so much will fade over time. I did not make the same mistake with my recently departed cat and it was really nice to refresh on the small things I loved about her while moving around our living room this evening (urn is on display and full of notes and cat trinkets).
