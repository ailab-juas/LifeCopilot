YSK if you know someone is going to argue with you and you want to avoid it , just sit near them.

content:
In order to avoid arguing with someone or having them yell at you for whatever reason, just sit next to them when having a discussion.
 For instance if you're at work and you have a meeting and you know there's that one person that will start yelling or disapprove everything you say, sit next to them in the table. Or if you want to avoid getting yelled at from your parents.
The thing is that its difficult for people to yell at someone when they are next to them. They feel awkward and they arent comfortable to exaggerate. 
Whereas if you stand across from them in some distance, it is easier for them to throw a fight.
