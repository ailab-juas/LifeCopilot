LPT: You can pay $0 to medications that cost $1000s by just applying to manufacturers’ websites!

When I initially relocated from Canada to the US and they told me that monthly cost of Xarelto (a type of blood thinner) is $550, and my thousands dollar a year student insurance only covered about $15/month, I was shocked.

Long story short, I googled lots of coupons and most of them didn’t work as promised.

I luckily came across with manufacturer’s coupon, which asked a few basic questions. Whether I could pay the medication without financial hardship (No), and name, address, insurance type. It than gave me a pdf card (they mailed a regular card later), with which I went to my pharmacy. The cashier at the pharmacy tried the card and told me that my total was $5. That was it! I didn’t pay a penny for the remaining 3 years.

Tl;dr: If your medication is expensive and your insurance isn’t very helpful, go to the manufacturer’s website for manufacturer’s coupons, which may bring the cost to $0.
