LPT - It takes approximately three to six months to learn a new job. The two month mark is the worst though. The shine has worn off but you still don't know what you're doing.

And that's okay! You're learning the job and the culture. It is  perfectly okay if you have the "WTF have I DONE!?" conversation with  yourself. This is also the beginning of the turning point in your  knowledge. Give yourself some grace.

 

Edit: Thank you for the awards Kind Strangers! I’m glad this post was helpful to so many of you. 

The timeline I listed is very general -sometimes it’s less, sometimes it’s more. It’s based on my personal experience changing jobs, mentoring a ton of new-hires over decades, and conversations with other managers and HR people.

If nothing else, reading through these posts, remember that you’re not alone. I wish I could give all of you a hug, it sounds like a lot of us could use one (myself included!).

Breathe, learn, breathe some more. You got this.
