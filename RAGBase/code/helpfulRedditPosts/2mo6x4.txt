LPT [Request]: How to negotiate pay when given a job offer

content:
I have a job interview this week after doing well in a phone interview. I believe I will be offered the job (hopefully!), however, the Director disclosed the "advertised pay" to me up front-- saying they are advertising 26-28k.

After doing my research I know the average pay in my area is closer to 35k. How do I negotiate this tactfully? Aiming to settle around 31k. (Salary offer- no OT pay).

Thanks for the help!

EDIT: Did not expect this to blow up! Thanks for all the help and support-- I will keep you guys posted on how it pans out! Side note: the job is not entry level-- the pay is low because it is a community center. Also, the pay was not disclosed until scheduling a face to face interview after doing well in a phone interview-- I did not give a response other than "Hmm" and "We can discuss it!" when presented with the range. Fingers crossed!
