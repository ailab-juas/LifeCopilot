YSK many dishwashers have filters that need to be pulled out and cleaned regularly, especially if you don’t rinse your dishes. Some are very easy to access, a quick twist and rinse/light scrub with a brush and they’re good to go. Other filters are deeper in the dishwasher and require you to take the dishwasher apart. Other dishwashers don’t have filters you can access. Check your manual or YouTube for videos on how to clean your dishwasher filter. Why YSK, they don’t clean or run as efficiently when they’re full of gunk. 

Also, tossing 1 cup of bleach in the bottom and running it on the hottest, longest cycle will help to disinfect it. 
Edit: /u/OlyScott pointed out you shouldn’t use bleach if you have a stainless steel dishwasher. Source: https://www.reference.com/world-view/can-use-bleach-clean-dishwasher-ae034ef1bea959f9
Edit 2: Instead of bleach you can use vinegar-it seems to be the preferred method by many people. 

Recent before and after of a filter cleaning I did:

Edit 3: That isn’t my dishwasher-it’s my boyfriend’s parent’s dishwasher. It’s been in their house for 15 years and the filter was never cleaned (because they didn’t know it existed). They do a quick scrape of the big foodstuff, and they don’t always rinse well before loading like you should-I’m guessing that’s why it looks so putrid. 
Edit 4: Another edit because I certainly don’t know it all-a few people pointed out that you should scrape all the big food-stuffs but NOT rinse before putting your dishes in because the detergent attaches to to food particles to do its job. /u/giddy-girly-banana cited: https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/dishwasher-cleaning-tips/ /u/naurugger cited https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/a33322/stop-prerinsing-dishes/
