LPT: Memorize at least ONE person's 9 digit cell phone #, it my be the one thing that can help you when you lose your phone (or it goes dead) and you are in a desperate situation.

content:
We are all too quick to rely on numbers just stored in our phones to call someone by just clicking on their name. If you lost your phone, who would you call and what is their number? If you don't have their number memorized (8/9 or 10 digits) how would you be able to contact them?
