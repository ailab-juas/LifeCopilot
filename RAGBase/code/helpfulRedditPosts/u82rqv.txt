title:
LPT I live my life by a simple rule: If the amount of time it is going to bother you is longer than the amount of time it takes to do it, just do it.

content:
For example; 
Taxes
Going to bother you for months but takes a few hrs. 
Bedtime but feel like you need a shower
Ill be up for hours bothered or showered and asleep in 30mins. 
It applies to almost any task in life. I've been happier ever since developing this rule.
