YSK the number to actually speak to a human person at Equifax is (866) 640-2273. I have spent the last 2 hours speaking to machines getting nowhere.

If anyone is trying to contact the group in charge of this payout(small as it may be) the number is...(833)759-2982

I am trying to make a big purchase only to find there is a fraud alert on my Equifax account and was supposed to “update my contact info” on said alert. I tried every avenue online and called 3 different numbers with only prerecorded machine answers. Needless to say, it won’t help you. There are even typos on their website and the machines you talk to actually say it’s better to call from a landline???  Onward, call the above number and talk to a “product specialist” (they sell Equifax credit monitoring). The person I spoke to was actually very helpful and knowledgeable. &lt;—just true, not a shill. Sad to say it. 

EDIT: Thanks for the Gold! That’s a first for me and it is much appreciated. 

EDIT: Thanks for the silver too! This is somehow vindicating of the whole experience! Glad to see a lot of people were helped by the number and if nothing else someone to relate too. 

EDIT: I’ve been accused here of being an undercover employee or some sort of shill. To be very clear, I only advised taking the monitoring over the $125 because I was under the impression that you’d get a better or more accurate and detailed report direct from the agency vs going through Credit Karma or something similar. By all means, do what is right for you. Sorry for causing any doubt or confusion
