LPT: If you’re going to meet someone for the first time, such a first date, always make sure to tell someone close to you where you are going and who you are going with.

I recently went hiking on a first date last week in some mountains about a hour drive from where I live. When we got there, she told me she had told her sister that we were going a date hiking. I told her I hadn’t told anyone and she told me I should have, because I didn’t know her and just incase something happened. 

She’s completely right, I had never met up with this girl and for all I know she could be a serial killer lol. Always important to let someone know where you are just incase.
