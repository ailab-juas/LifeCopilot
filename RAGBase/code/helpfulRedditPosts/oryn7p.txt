LPT Hotel Pillow Trick

content:
I travel a bit for work, and when I’m home I sleep best with a somewhat firm pillow that supports my head.  At most hotels the pillows are to be incredibly soft, and I feel like my head sinks almost all the way down. For me at least, it’s hard to sleep like this. I’d bring my own pillow, but they are usually too bulky for air travel.

So here’s my trick: I take one of the large bath towels, fold it to be about the same rectangular size as the pillow, and carefully tuck inside the pillow case with the pillow itself. If I do it right, it’s not lumpy at all but is completely flat inside. This adds a bit of firmness and prevents my head from sinking like a stone!

Anyway, it helps me, hopefully it’s useful for someone else…
