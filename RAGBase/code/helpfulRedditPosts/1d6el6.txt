title:
LPT: Write all of your school papers in google docs.

content:
You can access/print/download from any computer with internet access, everything is backed up, saves happen automatically for you, and it has all of the basic features you need to get it done. 

Plus if it's a group project you can easily collaborate and edit the document together in real time without being in the same room.

Edit: Some good points a being brought up. A better title would have been "Keep some subset of your important documents in some sort of online hosting and/or editing service." Nobody likes a fanboy.
