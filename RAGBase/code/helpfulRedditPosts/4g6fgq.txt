LPT: Coworkers are not true friends so don't treat them as lifelong pals and divulge personal info

content:
**Edit:**
 Wow, well this blew up. I guess you all deserve another LPT: If you want to hit the front page of LPT be absolute in your statement and divisive in its content. That being said, no I am not "salty" and haven't had any recent bad experiences at the workplace that prompted the post. Most of the better mannered posts hit exactly what I intended in that you tend to get trapped into co-worker relationships and falsely rationalize them as true friendships when in fact said "friendships" disappear when the job changes or their career aspirations warrant not valuing you anymore.
