title:
YSK that taking hormonal birth control can wildly affect your sexual preferences

content:
Why YSK: There are women who were on birth control for many years and stopped taking it only to discover that they aren’t attracted to their husband or boyfriend anymore. It’s a pretty devastating thing to have happen to you and many of them couldn’t salvage the relationship (understandably so). Taking anything that alters your hormones will most likely have an unpredictable impact on your dating and sex life, and while this pales in comparison to some of the negative physical health problems birth control can cause, it’s still a risk you should be informed of.
