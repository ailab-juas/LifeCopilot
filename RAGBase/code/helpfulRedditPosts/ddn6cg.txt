YSK that if you're trying to put out a small fire, the best way to do it is usually with a wet blanket

content:
This is especially true if you only have a limited amount of water. You can throw a whole bucket of water on a fire and it might not put it out (depending on how big the fire is), but if you soak a blanket or a sweater, it's much more effective at putting out fires. Remember, you're trying to stop the fire from getting air, with no air the fire will go out.

If you only have a bottle of water, your best bet is to soak whatever fabric is on hand (like a towel or a t-shirt) and dousing it in water.
