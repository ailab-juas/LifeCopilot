LPT: At the end of a job interview, if asked "Do you have any questions?" Always ask "Yes, Is there anything about my application that concerns you?"

content:
I do this in every interview and was taught it by a recruitment consultant. It serves to give you an idea of how well you did during the interview and they will often point out what part of it was the weakest giving you an opportunity to allay their concerns or to know what you need to work on.

Edit: People seem to think I stole this, I didn't. If advice is good, it gets around. I also want to note that yes, don't say this in a cheeky or boastful way, ask in an inquiring fashion.
