title:
LPT: Stop trying to relate to people after they tell you something.

content:
I watched this super interesting ted talk and I figured I'd share something I've implemented since if others haven't seen it. Essentially when someone tells you a story and its usually something bad thats happened most peoples instinct is to try and relate example: ( oh ya once dadada or thats so sad I know how that feels one time...) essentially the speaker at the talk said to instead continue asking them questions that allow them to elaborate and share their feelings. His example was when his son was in a car crash and then on life support and eventually woke up and he said most people he interacted with would leave him feeling drained. This was because they always tried to relate and it makes people feel cut off and like you're only listening to essentially find a way to talk. However once a friend of his said " how did it feel the first time you held your son after he woke up?". I started doing this and its actually remarkable, peoples faces kind of light up in a way where they're relieved to feel heard.  Try it out !

16 minute mark is where he tells the story.

Edit: for the sake of not offending anyone, this is not a commandment more so you may find this useful and it helped me. Also with the mention of neurodivergent people doing this as a way to make connections, I would never take that away from someone. Only IF you think this is something you'd like to work on or find interesting then great. I was trying to keep the title as short as possible so excuse it for sounding like God's commandment ðŸ¤£ðŸ’– Thanks for enlightening me on situations/ people this can't apply to/ shouldn't apply to.
