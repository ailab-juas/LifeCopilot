LPT: If you use Amazon often, ALWAYS check the used some section. Amazon has warehouse deals on a lot of products that can save you a great deal of money in the long run. The products from the warehouse are in original packaging and have never been used.

I was trying to buy a graphics card for $210, and then I checked the used section and the Amazon Warehouse Deals had it for $175!

If you have Amazon Prime, it is Prime eligible too.
