YSK that if you're having a physical or other form of check-up where you have to be partially nude done by a doctor of the opposite gender, you can usually request a "chaperone"--which is typically a nurse who will stay in the room with you to ensure that you are treated respectfully.

I'm a woman who went to Urgent Care to get an exam done recently that involved taking my shirt off, and unfortunately, no female doctors were available. I was asked prior to the exam if I wanted a "chaperone" to be in the room with me, and I thought that was pretty cool. And I bet men can request male chaperones as well.

YSK this because it's a great solution if you need to be seen for an issue, but aren't comfortable being alone with the doctor.

Edit: It sounds like in some places, it's protocol to have a chaperone there, which is great! It might vary based on doctor's offices or maybe some doctors are just better about remembering to get a chaperone because this is the first time I've ever been offered a one.
