LPT: If adopting an animal from a shelter, expect a few initial behavioral issues

content:
This is in no way acting as a discouragement! I've spent the last 10 years in some sort of animal rehabilitation and shelter volunteering, and it breaks my heart to see how often animals get returned after a few days because "he's just not adjusting."

In many cases, the animals I've personally worked with have been rescued from abuse, malnourished, or strays. Volunteers work very hard and have several guidelines as to what makes and animal ready for adoption. The top 5 complaints I've seen in my experience are:

**My new dog keeps going to the bathroom in the house**: First thing to consider in this situation is, *where was the animal living while at the shelter?* some shelters may keep their animals in runs or cells and often these animals don't get walked. That creates a habit of the animal being used to using the bathroom inside. Proactive walking really helps correct this problem! Take your dog out often in the first few weeks and then start to dial it back gradually. 

**Our kitty was so friendly and playful at the shelter, now she just hides all day, I don't think that we're "connecting"**: Your kitty was so happy and playful because she was somewhere she was accustomed to. Imagine, you may have shared a room with a friend, had a set schedule. All of a sudden you were taken, probably put in a cardboard box (also DONT LEAVE CATS IN CARDBOARD CARRIERS!! Cats are sensitive to over heating and it could have life threatening implications. Bring your own well ventilated carrier when adopting) went for a scary ride and were dumped out into a strange environment **alone** and away from everyone you knew. Give kitty time, she'll get into a rhythm with you. The best thing you can do right now is provide a clean litter box, fresh water and proper feeding at set times. DONT DRAG KITTY OUT FROM UNDER THE BED, this only enforces the need to find a better spot to hide.

**New Fido does nothing but bark non-stop all day**: FIRST OFF, this complaint usually comes from apartment dwellers. If you're adopting a dog make sure **beforehand** that your lease allows pets. Don't just get a dog then when your land lord shows up to say you have to get rid of it claim that it's a service dog/your just watching it for a friend. Fido is alone! Fido used to be in a place where there was a lot of commotion and all this silence is *weird!* HOOMAN WHERE DID YOU GO?? Dogs are pack animals, and when they're alone they feel vulnerable. Long walks and playtime before you have to leave for an extended period of time are good remedies to this. Leave a TV on on a low volume to shield all the scary outside noises. In my personal experience crate training was a great tool, but don't get one too big or too small (big enough to stand up without ducking the head, and and turn around in). This method was recommended to me by my vet and just happened to work, but it may not work for you. Professional consultation about a dogs excessive barking habits is never a bad idea. All relationships take work!

**Why does my new pet act so lethargic? They were so full of energy when we first met! It's what I liked about her!**: What are you feeding her? Is it the same food she was eating at the shelter? Sudden changes in diet can trigger upset tummies and more negative consequences. Food changes should be done gradually, consult your vet on the best way to do this if they start showing signs of stomach upset. It also has to do with the stress of being in a new environment, all these knew sights and smells are exhausting to process!

**Our new pet doesn't get along with our existing ones**: This. One. Is. huge. How would you feel if your s/o, roommate brought home some guy named chad and was like "oh yea, chad lives here now." Dogs (even though they're pack animals), and cats can be very territorial. This behavior may have only shown up when you caught kitty- hair standing on end making those *hilarious* guttural meowing noises; kitty doesn't understand that this new kitten is "pet of the family now" and not the evil outdoor neighbor cat. Even though you're in the same household, introductions should be done gradually. Giving each animal an opportunity to sniff and item that has the others scent on it, allowing them to sniff though doors etc. if your bringing a new dog home to your existing dogs, consider taking them to a dog park or anywhere fenced in that's not your house. This gives them the chance to interact and also escape each other if they feel really threatened, and it's not on territory that your dog may be trying to defend. Make sure interactions are positive, this doesn't mean that they get along every time- but that the animals get praise for not being aggressive.

Hope this helps some people navigate the first few days of shelter pet adoption!  And P.S. There's probably a bunch of typos. 

Edit 1: thank you u/E32636, u/bluesoul, and anonymous user for the gold!

Edit 2: I mentioned a few times in here about my kitter constantly peeing in the house. We took him to the vet and found out he had a UTI and was prescribed a prescription diet. Also something to consider when thinking about getting a new pet! What you think is a behavioral problem might actually be a medical problem! 

Edit 3: Sorry to all the other "Chads" I may have offended! Lol
