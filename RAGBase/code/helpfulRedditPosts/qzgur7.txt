LPT: If you're wrong, just admit it

content:
It seems like such a simple thing -- you made a mistake, you treated someone poorly, you were a jerk. Why is it so hard to admit when we are wrong?

If someone is brave enough to tell you that you wronged them, the best thing you can do is evaluate it carefully, and if they're correct, just say "You're right, I'm sorry, that's awful and I won't do it again. Is there anything I can do to make it right?" 

95% chance you'll smooth things over if you do this. Admit it if you're wrong. It's the bravest (and ironically easiest) way to move past a bad decision.
