LPT: When buying a used car, start it and rev the engine while you have a friend watch the exhaust. If the exhaust has a blue tint to it, it means the engine is burning oil and you should immediately walk away.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the extra tips, but just to clear things up I completely agree you should take it to a mechanic once you've made the purchase and have them take a look. This is just for when you're initially seeing the car. Another thing is I know it's fairly common for cars to burn oil, however if it's burning enough that it's making it through the catalytic converter then you most likely have a head gasket that's shot. Not worth the risk in my mind.
