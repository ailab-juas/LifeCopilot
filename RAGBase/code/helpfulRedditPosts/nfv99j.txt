LPT: HALT stands for hungry, angry, lonely and tired, and you should never make a big decision if you are any of these things.

content:
Important decisions in life should not be made when emotions are high. 

When your mind is not thinking clearly and a big decision can wait, it's best to wait 72 hours for you to reach a more rational state of mind.

If after three days, you still want to quit your job, buy that expensive car or move to another country, then start the process.
