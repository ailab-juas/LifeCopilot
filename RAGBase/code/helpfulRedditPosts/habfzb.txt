YSK: If you’re asking friends to help move, always have everything packed and ready to be picked up and go.

Currently helping my buddies girlfriend move and most of the things aren’t packed up.

Edit: obligatory first gold! Thanks for making this day better!

Edit2: After it was all said and done it was thankfully much more organized than at first glance. It was just a lot of things in a small space ( sooo many shoes ). We got them all moved in and they treated us to a lovely dinner!
