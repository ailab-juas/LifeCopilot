title:
LPT: How to Hack Army Basic Training

content:
I went through basic training a few years ago in Fort Benning, GA. When I left for basic, I had very few ideas of what to expect (as I'm sure most people leaving for basic do) I wrote a "guide" on what to expect and how to make it easier. Hopefully, it'll make someone else's life a little easier.

It's in PDF form and you can read it [here](http://www.josh-hartmann.com/basic-hacks.pdf)

If things have changed or you have more tips/tricks to add, please send me a PM and I will get them added ASAP.

Edit #1: Fixed some spelling/grammar issues.

Edit #2: Added stuff I forgot. Thanks [/u/noodlenugget](http://www.reddit.com/user/noodlenugget)

Edit #3: Also, THANKS [/u/smuttypirate](http://www.reddit.com/user/smuttypirate) FOR THE GOLD! First time ever!

Edit #4: Added some more stuff to general tips from [/u/reeljazz7](http://www.reddit.com/user/reeljazz7) Thanks!

Edit #5: Added more stuff thanks to [/u/phaqueue](http://www.reddit.com/user/phaqueue)

I have a day job, so I won't be adding more to the guide unless it's something really big that I left out. If you feel I missed something REALLY important that wasn't touched somewhere in the guide, please feel free to PM me and I will get it added.

Also, I will reorganize it tomorrow when I get to the office and add the first verse of the army song.

Edit #6: Added the first verse of the army song, fixed a few mistakes. Will reorganize/cleanup the whole document soon.
