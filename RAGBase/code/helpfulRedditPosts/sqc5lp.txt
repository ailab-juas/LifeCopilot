LPT: Dog Breeds Matter. A dog isnt just a dog, breeds vary significantly and some wont fit your lifestyle

content:
I have posted this before but it has been awhile and I was reminded again today of how important this is.  Dogs can vary greatly to the point where they are not even the same animal.  If you decide you want a dog, you need to research breeds and find what will fit your lifestyle, level of activity, your housing, your yard, and your food budget.  


Just because you think a dog is cute or looks cool doesnt make them a good fit.  There are some breeds that few people are capable of handing such as cattle dogs like border collies.  They are super intelligent and require both mental and physical stimulation or you are going to have a depressed dog that is very destructive.  


If you are not well-versed on dog breeds, here are some resources:  


[AKC Dog Breed Selector](https://www.akc.org/dog-breed-selector/) \- A quiz to help you determine breeds that fit your life.

[Select a Dog Breed](https://www.selectadogbreed.com/) \- A tool to help you find dog breeds for you.

[Orvis Dog Breed Information](https://www.orvis.com/dog-breeds.html) \- This has a huge list of dog breed description and they have a quiz as well.

[A Comprehensive Guide to Dog Breeds](https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-breeds-4162141) \- this is the same but it has lots of pictures and more info

As someone who has volunteered at rescues and worked at pet stores, I see people give up pets all the time because they didnt realize what they were getting into. This can be prevented.  I also would not suggest getting a puppy unless you have a lot of time and the resources to pay for training classes.  There are tons of adult dogs needing homes that you dont need a puppy.  


This isnt just with dogs but other animals as well.  If you are a parent getting your child a bet, I suggest finding a book written for children on that pet and having them write a report on the pet.  They may read the book and determine it wasnt what they were thinking.
