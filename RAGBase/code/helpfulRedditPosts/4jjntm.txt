LPT: if you're looking for a quick job like fast food go to rich areas....

THIS INFORMATION MIGHT BE USELESS FOR MOST PEOPLE EXCEPT STUDENTS LOOKING FOR SUMMER JOBS, AND PEOPLE IN NEED OF QUICK JOBS.

i've been working at subway for about 4 yeas at different states and different different areas, poor areas barely hire as managers there don't hire more what they need, while in rich areas(where i'm currently working) most fast food places STRUGGLE to find anybody to hire, and they don't refuse a single application and they pay at least $2 above minimum wage, the reason behind it is well most people there are rich and don't let their kids work while they're studying, and the jobs are more restricted than other areas in rules as well as inspections, unless you don't have a clean record in which case it's not as easy.

ps: this is from at least 5 different fast food managers.
