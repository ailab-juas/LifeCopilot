LPT: Instead of excessively worrying over a decision, decide what you're going to do, then do things to *make* it the right decision afterward.

content:
The best class I took in my Masters program was a decision science course. The prof had a lot of great LPT-type advice, but one thing he said in particular has stuck with me. He said most people will excessively worry and over-analyze a decision, but then do very little about it after the decision is made. We spend 95% of our energy pre-decision, then 5% after. However, he said a lot of the science shows that very often there isn't a "right" decision, but there are things we can do after that will make it right. For example, don't feel like there's a right/wrong decision to make when considering a job offer out of state. If you do decide to take it, once you're there do things to "make it" the right decision, like go out and make friends, work hard but keep a good work/life balance, etc. Change that 95/5 split to more like 50/50.

EDIT: Wow, my first reddit gold! Seriously, thanks!
