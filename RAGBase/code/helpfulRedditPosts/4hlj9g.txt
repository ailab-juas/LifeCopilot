LPT: While in school keep ALL of your graded work. Professors screw up. Be prepared for when they do.

Believe me, I know how easy it is to throw a bad homework in the garbage when you get it back or throw a test away that you killed it on but resist those urges. Keep everything that got a grade until at least the end of the semester. Professors aren't perfect, they do lose things and when they do your grade suffers unless you have proof. 

Just today, I check out my grades at the end of the semester and see that two of my homework grades were missing. Send the professor an email explaing that I did them and he tells me "oh well." I look through my book bag and find both of them. Saved myself from getting a failing homework grade. 

TL;DR Save your graded work. At the end of the semester you will thank yourself.

Edit: Didn't realize how many people don't keep graded work while at school. Nonetheless, helped me pop my front page cherry.
