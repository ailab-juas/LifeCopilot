LPT: Bring a bottle of baby powder to the beach.

content:
Before you get back in the car after a day at the beach, sprinkle some baby powder on the parts of your skin that are still coated in sand. The sand comes off much easier without any scrubbing, and works much better than those showers where you can just step in another pile of sand. My mom showed me this trick when I was little and I have never visited the beach without baby powder again.
