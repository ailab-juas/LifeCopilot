LPT: Put your phone on silent permanently. At first, you might worry you are missing important notifications, but you tend to check your phone every 5 to 10 minutes anyways or when things get slow. It's much more natural than having your stream of thought constantly interrupted by buzzing and tones.

Just wanted to add that you can select which important calls/texts/notifications come through with Do Not Disturb. I haven't needed to do that so far.

I work as a freelance tutor and have clients calling/texting/emailing at all hours of the day for the first time in my life. 99% of the notifications are not something I need to respond to immediately and I'd imagine most people could get away with responding after 5-10mins. If you don't like checking your phone every 15 minutes, this tip probably won't work for you. It's kinda fun randomly checking the phone and seeing a notification rather than being dragged to the phone by a noise. Also, phones with notification LED's are ðŸ‘Œ
