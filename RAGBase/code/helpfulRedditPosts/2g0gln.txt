LPT: Not sure whether or not to believe a movie critic's review? Look up their reviews for a few of your favorite movies.

Odds are, if you find yourself agreeing with them on the movies that you hold closest to your heart, they're a critic you can count on. If you're turning your nose up in disgust at what you're reading, you hold very different values in what to look for in a movie.

This is something I discovered a while back when I found myself often disagreeing with movie critics, and I was starting to believe the whole industry was just a big scam.
