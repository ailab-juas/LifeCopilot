LPT: If someone calls you to upgrade your home security system, don't tell them you don't have one. Say your system works fine and you're not interested in upgrading. You never know if you're talking to a real company or a possible burglar.

I get a lot of spam calls at work for people selling home security, and usually I tell them "this is a business" and they get embarrassed and hang up. But today someone called with the same spiel but then tried to then pivot to talking about business security instead. Pretty obviously someone trying to set-up a scam. Remember just because they're on the phone and sound like they could be miles away, don't take it for granted.

EDIT: Whoa just woke up to over 100 notifications and my most upvotes ever! I will do my best to keep up but it looks like this has taken on a life of its own, which is hopefully a good thing!

EDIT 2: Yea the obvious thing is to not answer numbers you don't know or to hang up immediately. The point is if you find yourself in this situation, answering safely won't be your first instinct. Maybe now it will be.

EDIT 3: For anyone wondering, the responses largely breakdown into a few categories:

1. Don't answer the phone/just hang up.
2. I don't need security I have guns/dogs.
3. Tell them to come so you can use your security/guns/dogs.
4. Yes this actually happened to me/someone I know/this is useful.
5. This would never happen/is not useful.

It's that 4th category that makes it all worth it! I appreciate your stories. Not trying to paranoid, just trying to help :)
