LPT: If you are a college student, make sure you take advantage of your professors' "office hours." Go with a list of questions, concerns, or doubts, and you'll not only get better grades, you'll actually learn more. Don't be intimidated or afraid to "sound stupid"; that's what office hours are for!

As a high-school drop-out who made their way through community college, state school, PhD, and now find myself a tenured community college professor, I really wish someone had told me this ~~15~~  20 years ago.

It is incredible how much students who come to office hours when they are confused improve over the course of the semester.  It's often not only the difference between passing or failing, it's also the difference between a "C" and an "A", and the difference between hating a subject and loving it so much the student decides to major/minor in it.

Of course, not every professor takes office hours as seriously as they should, just as not every student is ready to pass the courses they are in.  Sometimes professors hate teaching (and we all hate those profs), and sometimes a student just can't wrap their head around the concept/theory/skill being taught. But 9 times out of 10 office hours are more helpful than students expect.

EDIT: obligatory "oh wow this blew up" comment. I'm happy to see that so many agree, but sorry for those who have had bad experiences. Some professors are jerks, but in my experience they are the minority.

I'm having trouble keeping up with all replies, so apologies if I don't get to yours!

EDIT 2: Just realized I started college in 2001... I'm older than I thought!
