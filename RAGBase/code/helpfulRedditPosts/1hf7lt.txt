LPT: Taking a deep breath and holding it while brushing your tongue will help you resist triggering your gag reflex.

content:
If you take a deep breath and hold it, letting the pressure push against your throat, you will have a much easier time brushing your tongue without almost throwing up. Most people just stick their tongue out as far as they can, which is also good, but this can help you get a little further back without a problem.

Having said that, you still might trigger it.

EDIT: There are some other great tips in the comments section from other users. All the deepthroating references - meh.

Other users' suggestions for the lazy: 

1. Squeeze your non-dominant hand or thumb in the fist of that hand.

2. Breathe through your nose deeply.

3. Hum

4. Exhale

2nd EDIT: Based on the fact that this is on the front page, I'm going to assume that everyone that voted in the last 6 hours held their breath and jammed either a finger or a toothbrush (or other) in their throat. Record this moment as a phenomenon of the modern world.
