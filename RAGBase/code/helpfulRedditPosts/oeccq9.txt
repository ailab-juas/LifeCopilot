title:
YSK if you have symptoms similar to bipolar disorder but the timeline is too short, it could be PMDD.

Why YSK: I thought I had bipolar disorder my second semester of college because I had very sudden mood swings. Went to the doc, but they said since the depressive episode only lasted about a week/week and a half, it was too quick to be BD. 

Didn’t make the correlation to my depression and my menstrual cycle until my period went out of whack for a few months. Once it returned to normal, I noticed that the major episode always started about a week before my period and resolved after my period started.

Did some research, went to a new doc, turns out I was spot on and got a prescription for an antidepressant. (NOTE: therapy can also help, but premenstrual dysphoric disorder is specifically caused by hormonal changes, so a medication is a direct remedy, not a bandaid solution). 

Life Pro Tip: track when you feel lowest during the month, then compare to disorder specs. That can help you narrow down what you’re dealing with to get correct treatment.

Edit: added the written-out version of PMDD

Also, as noted in the comments, for men this could be a sign of IMS (irritable male syndrome):
