LPT: Press F2 to immediately rename a file, no more slow double clicks.

content:
Also if you have to rename a large number of files, select the first file press F2 and after you finish renaming it, press TAB to go to the next file or SHIFT+TAB to go to the previous file in the list, and continue from there.

Edit: Well this exploded all over my face. It's for PC, Mac just press return. Not sure about tabbing in Mac though.
