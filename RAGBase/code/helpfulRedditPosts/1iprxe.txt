title:
LPT: Ladies, when trying on swimsuit bottoms, make sure the fabrics tight around the bum. The fabric will stretch a half size bigger once you get in the water (the classic baggy bum look).

content:
Worked for a high end swim suit store. 

If debating between a large and a medium for example, opt for the medium if its still relatively comfortable. The uninterrupted fabric for the bum suffers the most from water bagging (which is why this doesn't apply for bikini tops).

(I have more swimsuit lpt's if wanted- for men too.)

Edit: Also why I recommend side tie bikini bottoms for women who don't buy swimsuits very often. Side tie will help you control the tightness as the swimsuit wears. 

Edit2: FOR EVERYONE, PLEASE DO NOT DRY YOUR SWIMWEAR IN THE DRYER. The heat will fuck hard core with the lycra (pulling, twisting, thins your fabric). MEN TOO: those board shorts aren't meant for the dryer. And please if you can, hand wash. You can fill your sink up, put some detergent (there are also great $3 swim wear detergents that actually work) and let it soak for a bit. Then rinse. It'll really lengthen your swimwear lifespan.

Edit3: I'm answering (trying to) everyone's questions. So look in comments - lots of lpts about male and female swimwear. I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING A SWIMSUIT AMA. **There are small busted, large busted, large hips, small hips LPT (including pictures). There are shopping experience tips. There are goggle tips for everyone. There are mens' board short tips!**
