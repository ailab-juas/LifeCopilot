LPT: Don't store block cheese in plastic. Use wax paper then put the wrapped block in a loosely rolled, unsealed storage bag in your refrigerator.

content:
When you unseal a chunk of cheddar (or other firm cheese) for the first time, remove all of the plastic cover. Wrap the cheese up in wax paper, then put it in a storage bag in the refrigerator. Don't seal the storage bag, just roll it so that it kinda-sorta closes off the top of the bag. The cheese will taste better and keep longer without either drying out or getting moldy.
