YSK that a lot of harm is done during Autism Awareness Month, and many autistic people want to change it to "Autism Acceptance Month" instead

content:
**Why YSK:** Lots of people are eager to pull out their wallets and share posts about autism this time of year, however, what many don't know is that April is a difficult month for a lot of autistic people, and much of what's done by well-meaning folks wanting to help us actually hurts.

Many 'autism orgs', despite backing from big-name companies and celebrities, are widely disliked by actual autistic people and have done a great deal of harm. In April, "Autism Awareness Month", massive amounts of money are pumped into these orgs and their campaigns despite mass condemnation from the very population they claim to serve, misinformation abounds, and autistic voices are drowned out.

Some good rules of thumb for whether you should support an autism org:

• If they use puzzle piece imagery, this is a red flag. Many autistic people do not like the puzzle piece due to the implication that we're missing something or are puzzles to be solved, as well as its strong association with a particularly controversial organization.

• They should always have a significant autistic presence on their board, and ideally be created by autistic people.

• Avoid orgs that use negative/dehumanizing language in relation to autism. Referring to autism as a tragedy or epidemic, autistic people as burdens, or encouraging parents to "grieve their lost child" are all red flags.

If you want to help or learn more about autistic people this month, rather than neurotypical-run orgs or friends with autistic children, try to seek out actual autistic people. Listening to autistic educators, supporting autistic creators and signal-boosting messages from autistic people are all great things you can do this April, and if you do donate, make sure it's to an org that actually centers autistic voices, be they typed, signed or spoken.

The hashtag #ActuallyAutistic was created by and for autistics as a way of finding and listening to autistic people about matters concerning them.

**Edit:** Thank you so much for the awards, and especially to all the autistic people who chimed in with their input and experiences. I never expected this to blow up as much as it did, and feel overwhelmed in both good and bad ways. I'm adding a final update to elaborate on a couple of things.

Regarding the post being vague/not naming names: I'm aware, and I agree it could have been worded better. I struggle with expressing myself succinctly, and on top of that was extremely wary of violating this sub's rules, particularly rule 6 with promoting charities or calls to arms, so I purposely did not directly name or link any particular organizations. The crux of what I wanted to convey with this post is that despite Autism Awareness Month being about autistic people, compared to big-name orgs and parents, autistic people's perspectives are rarely centered or listened to outside very specific spaces, and some ways to help change that.

Regarding the harm being done that's exacerbated in April, some examples are:

• Parents and caretakers posting videos of autistic people having meltdowns and in other vulnerable situations without their consent. Autistic people's most difficult, private moments are regularly filmed and uploaded online for all the world to see.

• Dangerous quack 'cures' being spread and consequentially inflicted on autistic people by their families and caretakers, including but not limited to unnecessary restrictive diets (when many autistic people already struggle with food), chelation, and feeding them bleach.

• Focusing almost exclusively on autistic children, and in some cases placing more focus on their caretakers than said children themselves, while ignoring the needs and continued presence of autistic adults. Autism is still falsely thought of by many people as something that only affects children or can be 'grown out of', but autistic children grow up to be autistic adults, and remain autistic for life.

• Anti-vaxxers using autistic people's existence for fearmongering.

• Sharing of dehumanizing and violent sentiments, such as parents wishing their autistic children had cancer instead of being autistic, and in some cases even wishing they would die. A major autism organization has shown a parent confessing to wanting to drive their autistic child off a bridge while said child was in the room with them and framed it in a sympathetic light. Many disabled people have been murdered by their caretakers, so much so that there is a [Disability Day of Mourning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_Day_of_Mourning), and this does not help the problem.
