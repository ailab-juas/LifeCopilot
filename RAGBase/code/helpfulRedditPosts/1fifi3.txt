LPT: To save battery life on your iPhone when using the GPS, take a screen shot of the direction list and view it through your photos.

content:
Don't forget to 'End Route' after taking the screen shot. Your battery will still get sucked up if you exit out and forget to end the route.

To take a screen shot on the iPhone: Simultaneously press the Home and the Sleep button. It will show up in your pictures.
