LPT: If trying to become pregnant, get short-term disability coverage (a.k.a. Income insurance) BEFORE you are successful at conceiving. You cannot sign up if you are already pregnant.

This is just one of the things I have learned about what to think about when expanding the family, and it seems like a much bigger deal in a country that will in some cases give you up to 24 weeks protected leave but NO income for those 24 weeks.

Why do you become ineligible for signing up for this insurance once pregnant? No idea. However, you do, and you will most likely be in dire need of this insurance. It costs a few dollars per month - I think mine is $60/month, but itâ€™ll be so worth it when I have my full post-tax income after giving birth.

My short-term disability insurance is through American Fidelity and will cover my income, after taxes, for 12 weeks. I am in Oregon and FMLA (family leave) is 6-12 weeks and bonding time, OFLA, is another 12 weeks. Both are protected by law and you cannot be fired because of taking them.

Anywho, good luck!
