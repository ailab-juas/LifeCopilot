LPT: If you might be late for something, don't try saving time from the drive.

content:
If you're late to work/school/an event, please don't try to just drive faster. It's dangerous.  The way I think of it: I spend about 8 minutes on the highway going 70 mph to get to class. Even if I were to try to go 100 mph for example, I would end up spending 5.6 minutes on the highway, which saves me less than 3 minutes. However, I've just endangered many people, including myself, and at the **very** least, I've risked getting a ticket.

Saving time should come from other things. You could spend less time showering, being on social media, or even by eating while getting ready. Getting up earlier/sleeping earlier would work the best.

TL;DR: If you're trying to drive faster to get somewhere on time, you're saving time in the wrong ways. Please stay safe.
