LPT: Unless she explicitly asks you to, do NOT get any woman in your life a Christmas present related to cooking or cleaning.

content:
 Sometimes we men don't register this because we are raised to be into practical presents but getting your wife or mother or girlfriend or whoever a cleaning or cooking implement instead of something that will allow her to enjoy herself of feel special is DEEPLY DEEPLY DEEPLY insulting because it implies that a large part of your perception of her is her work maintaining the house as opposed to as a full person you love and appreciate. It is grievously rude so please do not do it.

Edit: This will be the one and only adjustment for the disingenuous pedants in the comments. If you are VERY confident that a cooking device will help her with her cooking hobby and will NOT make her feel like just a person who cooks for you then of course that is a fair exception. But I'm pretty sure most of the people who said that knew what I meant and were just enjoying themselves nitpicking a good core point.
