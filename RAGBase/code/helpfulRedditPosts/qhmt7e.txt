LPT: Leaving a large pair of men’s shoes by your front door can deter break-ins

content:
I read this on a neighborhood chat regarding a recent crime nearby.

I guess while we’re here I’ll give you another one (no idea if this is an actual thing but our local PD posted it). If you hear your hose/spigot running in the middle of the night, don’t investigate! The concept being that a criminal turns on the hose at full flow in an attempt to lure the homeowner/resident outside. Kinda messed up.
