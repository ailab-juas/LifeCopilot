title:
LPT: if you have an elderly family member that lives alone, get a copy of their house key made and keep it in a lock box outside the home just in case they need help

content:
An elderly family member recently fell and broke a bone, we got a key lock box and all the family helpers (kids/grandkids) have the combo to the lock box so we can come in and help anytime they call. 

It can even help ems access the house because they can give the lock location and combo to dispatch.
