YSK that a law called CISPA is being debated in the House right now and every pro-privacy amendment has been voted down. It will go to a vote tomorrow, there is still time to do what we do.

CISPA -- the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act

Easy tool to call your reps about this: http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/cispa

CISPA allows companies like [Google, Facebook, and Twitter](http://SaveYourPrivacyPolicy.org) to share data with the government and with each other for vaguely defined "cybersecurity" reasons. It invalidates all other privacy protections on the books, makes every privacy policy on the web a total joke, and allows data to be shared directly with the secretive NSA.

A recent amendment did not fix the sharing with the NSA, [even though the bill's sponsors said it did.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/04/amendment-wont-stop-data-going-nationa-security-agency)
