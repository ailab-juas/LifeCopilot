title:
YSK Stores like Walmart will put items on clearance without reducing price.

Why YSK: Many people don't realize when going into the clearance section of a store like Walmart, they add a yellow sticker that doesn't mention a previous price. This is often to make a person believe the price is reduced but in fact they just want to sell them faster without reducing first.

Edit: This was my most upvoted and awarded post yet. I edit this now that the votes have slowed to a near stop. Thank you so much!
