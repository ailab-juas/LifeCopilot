title:
If your kids get scared watching a movie, show them the film's behind the scenes or "making of" clips online.

Sometimes saying "it's just a movie" doesn't help. I find showing the making-of clips with the actors getting in makeup or special effects production helps them understand.  What other tricks/tips do you use?

(Aside from avoiding scary movies :) 

Edit: Sorry I forgot the LPT: in the title :/ I've read the rules I promise!
