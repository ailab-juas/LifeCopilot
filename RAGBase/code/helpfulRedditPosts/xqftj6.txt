YSK: You shouldn't buy a new Bluetooth speaker, once its battery wears off. You most often just need to replace the battery!

Why YSK: For most speakers you can order a new battery for your model online for about 10-20€/$ and replace the battery in 10-20 minutes and the device will be like new. 

My experience: I bought the JBL charge 3 in 2017 and it started to turn off and make weird fart noises after about 3 years even though it was fully charged. I opened it up and the battery was fully bloated, so I checked for a tutorial on YouTube and ordered a new battery for 16€ and put it in. Voilà! The speaker is just as on the first day, when I bought it. And it really didn't take much. If you have similar problems with yours, check if there's an easy way to replace it online. Mostly, you'll just need a small screwdriver. You will save a lot of money and some of the environment by not throwing away an otherwise  perfectly fine speaker.

This is also true for other devices that have a built in battery.
Note that the warranty of the device runs out when you open in. Coincidentally (!) though, most of these problems start to appear after the warranty runs out.
