YSK: It's possible to have two differently shaped ear canals -- and that might be why your earbud keeps falling out

content:
Most people simply take for granted that the insides of their ears are symmetrical, but this is often not the case. It's perfectly normal for one ear hole to be larger/smaller than the other!

**Why YSK**: Earbuds come with multiple tip sizes to help you get the best possible fit, but most people don't think to test eartip sizes independently for each ear. If one of your earbuds keep falling out, this can be a sign that you didn't pick the most optimal eartip size on that side.

Some additional information:

* Earbuds *do* fall out for other reasons, too. For example: even well-fitted earbuds can fall out during exercise (*though ill-fitting earbuds will definitely worsen that issue*)
* Sizing issues can go in both directions (too small OR too large), don't just assume that the eartip is too small if it doesn't fit! The best way to find out is by experimenting (*please don't do anything that hurts, though!*)
* If you can't seem to find the right fit, consider buying aftermarket eartips. You can often buy sample packs that come with a pair in each size -- these sample packs are great for people with asymmetrical ear canals, because you effectively get two usable pairs of eartips instead of just one.

I was surprised to find that this isn't a very well studied phenomenon! Among audio enthusiasts, it's generally thought that that this kind of thing happens fairly often (to the point where Shure specifically talks about the issue in [a support article](https://service.shure.com/s/article/earphones-do-not-fit-are-uncomfortable-or-will-not-stay-secure-in-my-ear-canal?language=en_US)), but it does not seem as though anyone has done a proper study to see how prevelant such asymmetries actually are.

There *is*, however, a study (Oliveira, R., Babcock, M., Venem, M., Hoeker, G., Parish, B., &amp; Kolpe, V., 2005) related to how ear volume changes with jaw movement that could be extrapolated to suggest that at least 1/3 individuals have some significant level of asymmetry (n=67).
