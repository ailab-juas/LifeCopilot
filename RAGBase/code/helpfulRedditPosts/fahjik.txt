YSK just because a tattoo artist is good at one style doesn’t mean they’re good at everything

content:
I get a lot of tattoo inquiries that start with “I love your work...” and then they proceed to ask me for something that is completely outside of my abilities/specific style. This isn’t my complaining, but I simply wanted to share that just because we may be good at one style doesn’t mean we’re all capable of doing everything! 

When you’re looking for a tattoo artist go through their portfolio and see if what you’re looking to get is represented in their work. A lot of us end up specializing in a small handful of things and most styles require specific techniques and knowledge of the rules that go along with it. There is a small group of people who are actually good at almost everything (my coworker is) but this isn’t the case across the board. You will get a better tattoo if you find the person who fits your idea best because they’ll be excited to do it and chances are they’ll spend more time on the design because of it!
