YSK people interpret "White Elephant Gift" in two different ways

Why YSK what type of white elephant exchange it is: People get pissed if you bring the wrong type of gift

The most common type of gift exchange that people call a white elephant gift is one where it's essentially junk.  Something that you have that is bizarre and strange to give to somebody else because maybe you don't want it and it's likely funny.

The second type of one is where they use the term white elephant gift to mean the same as a gift exchange with decent gifts under a certain amount involving a game.

I started at a new job once and was invited to the party in which they had a white elephant gift.  Thankfully, I didn't know about it because otherwise I would have brought the junk.  However almost everyone else brought gift certificates, wallets, scarves, etc.  Except for one person, who brought a brass animal and used the other definition.  People were pissed all night about the crappy gift.  In fact, people angrily talked about it the next few years whenever the exchange was discussed.

I have since heard it done both ways from many sources.  If someone somewhere suggests this, make it clear what type they mean.
