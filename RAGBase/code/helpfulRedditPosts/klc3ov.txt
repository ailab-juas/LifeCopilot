LPT: In oral sex, when a man or woman is about to climax, DO NOT suddenly change your pace or rhythm

content:
I’ve noticed that whenever I communicate that I’m about to blow, my best sex partners have always kept their pace steady until after I’ve cum. Recently, I began noticing a pattern in porn where the actors will suddenly go super fast or change the beat completely when the person gets close (which likely influences our culture). When a person is moments away from climaxing, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU’RE DOING! Don’t suddenly stop and try something different, it always ruins the build up, a total buzzkill. Find the rhythm that feels good for both parties, commit to it and you’ll see, your partners will thank you later.
