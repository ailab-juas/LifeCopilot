YSK: There are people out there looking to give a chance, even if you don't have the experience. Talk about what you did that could be relevant, in your opinion, and ask for a chance

Why YSK: There are many people out there who are willing to give a chance, because they feel like they were given a chance. However, they expect the ones in front of them to be aware of it, and ask for it.

I have been given a chance by my first manager, after a 1h interview, in a different country. I paid it forward to people I've interviewed. All worked out, needless to say.

When I interviewed for my current position, I knew I wanted it, without direct experience on it, but from what I've learned. I talked about whatever I did that could be relevant for the position, and I've asked for a chance. I got it.

Know what you want, and be willing to work for it. If you can explain it, it will work.
