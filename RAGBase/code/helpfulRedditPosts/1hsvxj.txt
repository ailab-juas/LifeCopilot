LPT: To help a child overcome a fear, teach them about what scares them.

content:
For children afraid of thunder and lightning, teach them what they are, why they happen, and how to protect yourself from lightning. For children afraid of dogs, teach them the appropriate way to act around dogs and even just general facts about dogs (such as identifying certain breeds) so they are more comfortable around them.
