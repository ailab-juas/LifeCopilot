YSK: Remember this Christmas, if someone buys a $25 gift for you, and they make minimum wage, they paid 2-3 hours of their life to get you that gift. Be humble, gifts don't have to cost much to have value.

Why YSK: Friends or family might have had a tough year and might have put a lot of effort/thought into your gift so even though it may not be hundreds of dollars, remember to be kind!
