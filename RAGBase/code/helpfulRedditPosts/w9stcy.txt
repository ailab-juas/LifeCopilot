LPT: If you offer your advice for free no one will take it, but if you charge for your advice then people will listen to your every word.

My dad was a lawyer and would say this to me all the time. He charged out at hundreds of dollars per hour. If he met some random person at a bar and told them *exactly* what to do... they never would.

When he charged them they would take his advice.

The more you charge, the more seriously someone will take your advice.
