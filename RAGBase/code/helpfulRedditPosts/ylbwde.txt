LPT: If you're at an event where alcohol is served and you observe someone who isn't drinking, don't ask them why. They could very well be an alcoholic in recovery.

ETA: Boy these comments run the gamut. 

There are indeed a *ton* of reasons why someone isn't drinking. Obviously. The bottom line of this tip: you wouldn't believe how many people think a person not drinking warrants inquiry and the fact is it's nobody's business. 

Also, for those expressing concern, I'm not a recovering alcoholic. I know plenty and have witnessed this awkward exchange many, many times and it's just always so shitty. So yeah, just don't be that guy!
