title:
YSK to not crush your pills, tablets, or capsules unless a Pharmacist or Doctor has advised you that it is safe and appropriate to do so.

content:
**Why YSK:** to summarise, crushing pills can cause serious side effects, may prevent the medicine from working properly, and could alter how the body processes and responds to the drug. If you find it difficult or impossible to swallow large tablets or capsules, consult a pharmacist or doctor on alternative medicines that are easier to absorb.

Oral medications available in tablet or capsule form contain one or more active ingredients — the actual drug intended to treat a particular disease or condition — and several inactive ingredients. Inactive ingredients include coating materials, flavorings, dyes, and binders that hold tablets or granules from capsules together. Drug companies use complex manufacturing techniques to combine these ingredients into final products that are designed to release their active ingredients at a specific rate and in a specific location within the digestive tract, such as the stomach or the small intestine.

For example, some uncoated, immediate-release tablets are designed to disintegrate quickly in the stomach, whereupon the active ingredients are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. For these drugs to work, the active ingredients must be able to withstand exposure to the strong acid found in the stomach before they are absorbed.

For other drugs containing active ingredients that would otherwise be broken down by stomach acid, manufacturers have designed tablets and capsules with acid-resistant coatings (often called enteric coatings). Only when these tablets or capsules move from the stomach to the small intestine will the coating dissolve, allowing the release of the active ingredients.

In addition, many drugs in tablet or capsule form are designed to release their active ingredients even more slowly, over a period of 12 to 24 hours as the tablets or granules from the capsule pass through the small intestine. This sustained-release (also called controlled-release, long-acting, and extended-release) design provides the convenience of once- or twice-daily dosing and minimizes the variation in the amount of drug in the blood over the course of a day. This design can improve patient compliance and drug effectiveness while decreasing the risk of adverse effects.

Crushing a tablet, opening a capsule, or chewing either of these can circumvent many of the protective design features intended to control when and where a drug is released in the digestive tract. Depending on the drug, this can result in overdosing, underdosing, or direct toxic injury to the lining of the mouth, stomach, or intestines.
